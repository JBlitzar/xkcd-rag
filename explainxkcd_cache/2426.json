He was recently awarded a one million dollar prize for his recent work. This may be the press conference he is going to. The comic shows him singing a silly made-up song to his pet fish as he goes about his daily routine - a counterintuitively childlike (albeit delightful and relatable) habit for an authority figure who normally presents himself to the public in a professional and prosaic \"grown-up\" manner. Incidentally, this characterization of Dr. Fauci doesn't seem to be far from the truth: Fauci's daughter Jenny is [https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2007/09/28/anthony-fauci/ quoted in the Washington Post] as saying of her father: \"He's a goofball[...] He works hard and he does his thing, but he comes home and he's singing opera in the kitchen and dancing around.\"\n\nIn [[231: Cat Proximity]], it's presented as 'normal' for people to make inane statements and use {{w|baby talk}} near {{w|cat|cats}}, but here, Dr. Fauci is singing to his fish. The title text explains that, as he is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, he is forbidden from owning a pet cat, because petting the cat would be \"giving aid and comfort\" to an allergen, which is (a reference to) one definition of {{w|Treason laws in the United States|treason under the United States Constitution}}. The “allergen” refers to the hypothetical cat—some people are {{w|Allergy to cats|allergic to cats}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A man with a bit of hair, later shown to represent Dr. Fauci, is putting on a white lab coat as he walks past his fish tank. The tank, on a small table, has one small fish in it, looking at him. Inside the tank there is also a seaweed-like plant and a small castle and an even smaller pyramid. Seven music notes, 4 double and 3 single notes, are scattered about Fauci's speech which is written with lower case letters (normal capitalization) as opposed to normal xkcd text with all small caps.]\n:Dr. Fauci: ♫ ''Putting on my doctor coat'' ♫\n\n:[Dr. Fauci is buttoning the coat. He is now standing to the right of the fish tank. The fish has turned towards him and has moved to the end of the tank near him. He still sings with the same letter type and six music notes, 3 double and 3 single notes, are scattered around the text.]\n:Dr. Fauci: ♫ ''It's the coat I wear'' ♫\n\n:[Dr. Fauci is back to the left of the fish tank, looking at himself in a mirror, and touching his face. There is a small shelf with three items on the wall beneath the mirror. The fish has swam back to its original position turned towards him. He is still singing, with one double and one triple note on either side of his lyrics. An off-panel voice addresses him from the right, and he replies. These exchanges are written in normal xkcd small caps style.]\n:Dr. Fauci: ♫ ''so they know how good a doctor I am'' ♫\n:Off-panel voice: Dr. Fauci?  The press conference is in five.\n:Dr. Fauci: Be right there!\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:It's nice to think about how serious and important people probably ''also'' absentmindedly sing made-up songs to pets.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:COVID-19]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
