Exponential growth involves an initial quantity being multiplied by any number greater than one again and again. It can cause small numbers to compound into very large numbers faster than might be intuitive. This principle is important in a number of real life applications, ranging from biological growth to inflation to reaction kinetics. \n\nThe earliest versions of this story come from India and involve a man (the inventor of {{w|chess}}, in some tellings), being offered a reward by a king, and asking that a single grain of wheat (rice, in some versions) be placed on the first square of a chessboard, two on the second, and each subsequent square having twice as many grains as the one before. In the story, the king generally laughs off such a reward as being trivial, but soon learns that the reward would be impossible to pay. Since a chessboard contains 64 squares, the final square would contain 2<sup>63</sup> (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) grains. This would be around 600 billion tonnes of wheat (which, even in modern times, would be centuries of global wheat production).\n \t\t \t\nIn some versions of the story, the man is executed for embarrassing the king and/or being over-greedy; in others, he's rewarded for his cleverness; in yet others he becomes king himself as a consequence. There are also other versions that [https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/finnemore_souvenir_programme/episodes/7/5/ subvert the well-known tale] by the king not being so na√Øve as to fall for the 'trick' played by the creator of the problem.\n\n[[Black Hat]] initially appears to be using this example, to demonstrate a mathematical principle, but actually turns out to be using it to \"win\" a chess match by covering the chess board in rice until his opponent quits out of frustration. Naturally, despite his claims that it's \"nearly impossible to counter\", under the International Chess Federation ({{w|FIDE}})'s [https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf Laws of Chess], this would be illegal on several levels, as deliberately distracting or annoying your opponent is a violation, as is deliberately displacing the chess pieces. Black Hat, being the chaotic [[classhole]] that he is, likely simply doesn't care, and counts it as a win when his opponent [[Hairy]] stomps off out of annoyance. \n\n{{w|Garry Kasparov}} and {{w|Anatoly Karpov}} are both Russian chess grandmasters and former world champions. The two men famously competed for the world championship in the 1980s. The Kasparov gambit is a famous gambit that Kasparov played multiple times (but not, as Black Hat's is, something that can be played very early in the game). The title text implies that Kasparov actually tried Black Hat's method on Karpov, who attempted to consume all the rice with \"increasingly large rice cookers\", but eventually couldn't keep up. While this is obviously fictional,{{cn}} it fits with the principle of exponential growth. If exponential growth is unrestricted, it will eventually grow beyond the constraints of anything that could plausibly be built to contain it. \n\nIn any case, it appears that in his enthusiasm to enact his scheme, Black Hat has neglected to even set up his own pieces (or they have already been completely buried), never mind wait for the game to commence, so Hairy has nothing to resign from - indeed his king still appears to be standing as he walks away, so he may be only assumed to have resigned/defaulted due to competition rules that cover various circumstances in which one may leave the playing area (but, apparently, nothing too restrictive about bringing in sacks of rice). \n\nAnother unusual Kasparov gambit is mentioned in [[3082: Chess Position]].\n\n==Math==\n\nThe amount of rice collected on each square of the chess board is listed below. It all sums up to around 400 billion tons (or {{w|tonne}}s, the various distinctions being not so important), taking each grain as weighing approximately 0.02 grams. This is 500 times the annual world production.\n\nThe last day, alone, would require 200 billion tons. But the implicit nature of this doubling is that the amount of rice you put on at any stage is exactly equal to the amount of rice already on the board ''plus one extra grain''. So there were around 200 billion tons already, before the last square required a virtually identical additional amount.\n\n* First row:\n** a1: 1 grain\n** a2: 2 grains\n** a3: 4 ...\n** a4: 8\n** a5: 16\n** a6: 32\n** a7: 64\n** a8: 128\n* Second row\n** b1: 256\n** b2: 512\n** b3: 1,024\n** b4: 2,048\n** b5: 4,096\n** b6: 8,192\n** b7: 16,384\n** b8: 32,768\n* First column of third to seventh rows\n** c1: 65,536 grains (~ 1 kg)\n** d1: 16,777,216 (~ 400 kg)\n** e1: 4,294,967,296 (~ 100 tons)\n** f1: 1,099,511,627,776 (~ 25,000 tons)\n** g1: 281,474,976,710,656 (~ 6 million tons)\n* Eighth row, in detail\n** h1:    72,057,594,037,927,936 (~ 1.5 billion tons, more than the 2022 world harvest)\n** h2:   144,115,188,075,855,872\n** h3:   288,230,376,151,711,744\n** h4:   576,460,752,303,423,488\n** h5: 1,152,921,504,606,846,976\n** h6: 2,305,843,009,213,693,952\n** h7: 4,611,686,018,427,387,904\n** h8: 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (~ 200 billion tons)\n* Total: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615\n\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Wheat_Chessboard_with_line.svg Example on the chessboard (SVG diagram)]\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Black Hat is talking to Cueball standing next to him, arm raised.]\n:Black Hat: Exponential growth is very powerful.\n\n:[Closeup on Black Hat.
