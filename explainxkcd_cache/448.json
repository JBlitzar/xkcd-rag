As such, their {{w|circadian rhythms}} have become out of sync with one another, and probably out of sync with everyone else in their own {{w|timezone}}. They therefore experience something similar to the \"{{w|jet lag}}\" experience by travelers going from one timezone to another.\n\nThe title text clarifies that they are using \"going to sleep at midnight and waking up at 8 AM\" as their standard of measurement. If the drowsy man was \"in Honolulu\" yesterday and has woken up \"in Taipei,\" it means he has gone to sleep 6 hours later than yesterday, and is now also waking up 6 hours later than yesterday (if you don't take the {{w|International Date Line}} into consideration).\n\nThis comic may (like in [[320: 28-Hour Day]]) be a commentary of the {{w|28 hour day}} where a person shift their sleep patterns to 6 x 28 hours a week instead of the usual 7 x 24 hours.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A drowsy Hairy walks over to Cueball on a computer.]\n:Hairy: *Yawn* Good morning from Taipei.\n:Cueball: You're drifting west. You were in Honolulu just yesterday.\n:Our sleep schedules are so messed up that's it's easiest to just refer to where our internal clocks seem to be.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Time]]"
