(Perhaps he is working at a library or bookstore, or sorting a personal collection.) ''Star Wars'' as a whole is a multimedia franchise, which includes films, TV series, novels, etc, but often singularly refers to {{w|Star Wars (film)|the original 1977 film}} later more lengthily titled ''Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope'' (or, given the fact that the rest of the titles are books, one of several novelizations based on the script). The classifications get more complicated to determine as the conversation progresses while revealing a quite specific obsession with the character of {{w|Boba Fett}}. The complexity may even end up converting {{w|Lumpers and splitters|lumpers into splitters}}, a philosophical distinction that another [[2518: Lumpers and Splitters|recent comic]] touched upon. \n\nNonfiction (also spelled non-fiction) is any document or media content that intends, in good faith, to present only truth and accuracy regarding information, events, or people. In contrast, fiction offers information, events, or characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary, or else leaves open if and how the work refers to reality.\n\nIn the end, White Hat suggests that, since Cueball has so many works featuring Boba Fett, it would be more useful to group them together in a new category rather than sorting them into the fiction and nonfiction sections.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Media name \n!Explanation \n|-\n| ''{{w|Star Wars (film)|Star Wars}}''\n| ''Star Wars'' is a science-''fiction'' movie released in 1977 (re-released in 1981 as ''Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope'')\n|-\n| ''{{w|The Making of Star Wars}}''\n| This was a television special about how ''Star Wars'' was made, which would make it nonfiction.\n|-\n| ''Star Wars: The Adventures of Boba Fett''\n| This would be one of the ''Star Wars'' franchise's continuity of stories, making it fictional. Not a currently extant release, but something like this {{w|List_of_Star_Wars_films#Unproduced_films|has been long anticipated}}, and now possibly inspired by the imminent release (as of the comic's time of posting) of ''{{w|The Book of Boba Fett}}''.\n|-\n| ''Star Wars: The Official Guide to Boba Fett's Armor and Weapons''\n| While the content of this guidebook is entirely fictional, the book is factual.  Boba Fett (a fictional character){{citation needed}} does in fact [https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/253196 have durasteel]/[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Boba_Fett%27s_armor Beskar] armor (a fictional material), so the book is technically non-fiction.  \n|-\n| ''Boba Fett's Gadgets and How He Got Them''\n| This could either be a non-fictional book or docuseries similar to the previous entry, or instead an in-universe adventure series or film.  The rhythm of the words is similar to the in-universe guidebook ''{{w|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them}}'' from the {{w|Harry Potter}} universe - this is a non-fiction book used educationally for young wizards within the fictitious world and also a fiction book within the real world. This book was turned into a 2016 {{w|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|feature film}}, starring Eddie Redmayne.\n|-\n| ''Boba Fett: A Life'' by Doris Kearns Goodwin\n| {{w|Doris Kearns Goodwin}} is a historian and biographer who has written biographies of many influential people. Since Goodwin is a non-fiction writer, one would have to read this (non-existent<ref>List of books on Goodwin's website: [https://doriskearnsgoodwin.com/books/]</ref>) book to determine whether the biography is a fictional account of the character, or a factual account of the fictional history of the character. If the book doesn't establish any new canon, and is instead citing only recorded (fictional) facts from the Star Wars Universe and, perhaps, the real-world influences on and by the character, it could legitimately be considered non-fiction. Doris Kearns Goodwin is also mentioned in [[2160: Ken Burns Theory]].\n|-\n| (title text) Boba Fett's biography of Doris Kearns Goodwin\n| It is unclear how, or why, a fictional character would write a biography on a real life person, but there's always the possibility that there was already a fictional Doris, in-universe to Boba, whose own life and exploits would be natural for an actually fictional factual output. \n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is talking to Ponytail and White Hat.]\n:Cueball: ''Star Wars''?\n:Ponytail: Fiction.\n\n:[Same setting.]\n:Cueball: ''The Making of Star Wars''?\n:White Hat: Nonfiction.\n\n:[Closeup of Cueball.]\n:Cueball: ''Star Wars: The Adventures of Boba Fett''?\n:Off-panel voice: Fiction.\n\n:[Closeup of Ponytail.]\n:Cueball (off-panel): ''Star Wars: The Official Guide to Boba Fett's Armor and Weapons''?\n:Ponytail: Nonfiction, technically.\n\n:[Cueball has lifted a hand palm up as he talks to Ponytail and White Hat.]\n:Cueball: ''Boba Fett's Gadgets and How He Got Them''?\n:Ponytail: ...Fiction? \n:Ponytail: It depends.\n\n:[Cueball is talking to Ponytail and White Hat.
