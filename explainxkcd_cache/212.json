Tree houses are a child's own special place to do stuff away from their parents, have some autonomy, perhaps form a club. The obsession with tree houses usually fades once a child reaches their teenage years, but of course some of us never grow up. Being an adult geek/scientist who still enjoys childish things, Randall wants to build a sophisticated tree house rather than a simple one.\n\n{{w|The Swiss Family Robinson}} is a novel by the Swiss pastor and writer {{w|Johann David Wyss}}. In the novel, a shipwrecked family builds a tree house as good as a normal house complete with library and mechanical contraptions.\n\nThe title text makes reference to the regular [[xkcd]] joke about how terrifying {{w|Velociraptors}} from the movie {{w|Jurassic Park}} are. [[87: Velociraptors|But they could never reach a tree house]].\n\n\"Raptors\" might refer to the informal bird group, hawks and owls and such, a joke relying on the previous infatuation with velociraptors.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:My Brain\n:[Picture of Brain.
