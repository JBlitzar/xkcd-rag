In the above comic, [[Cueball]] plays the game in 2009. Newer games usually require more powerful computer parts, such as GPUs and RAM. The prices of these computer parts usually start expensive but drop quickly, so even a very cheap computer developed in 2009 will comfortably run a 2004 game.\n\nAdditionally, the price for an older game is considerably less than those of the more recent variety. Even the price of a once-new, highly anticipated {{w|Video game industry#Economics|AAA}} game is almost definitely guaranteed to have fallen due to the presence of newer games and the relative maturity of the present game. Most of the expected sales of a game happen near the release. A game would not be deemed that lucrative after 5 years, prompting a price drop to justify its sales or even printing. Sometimes, a game will be released with several, if not all, expansion packs at a fraction of the price of purchasing them all separately during the initial release.\n\nHowever, the downside to Cueball's strategy is that his gaming knowledge will be five years out of date. In a subculture that moves as fast as video games, it's almost impossible for Cueball to embarrass himself harder.\n\nOn the last panel, \"The cake is a lie\" and \"This was a triumph\" are references to ''{{w|Portal (video game)|Portal}}'', a video game released in late 2007. The cake references originate from the promises of cake that {{w|GLaDOS}}, a character in the game, makes to the player. Exploring the levels reveals several hiding places that seem to have been used, in one of which the player can find the words \"The cake is a lie\" repeatedly scrawled on the wall. As predicted, ''Portal'' was indeed considered old-fashioned by early 2013, with the developers themselves stating they were sick and tired of the endlessly parroted jokes. Both ''Portal'' and ''Half-Life 2'' were released by the same company, {{w|Valve Corporation|Valve}}, and they released ''{{w|Portal 2}}'' in 2011.\n\nThe song \"{{w|Still Alive}}\", which the lyric \"This was a triumph\" comes from, was previously referenced in [[375: Pod Bay Doors]], and later referenced in [[1141: Two Years]].\n\nThe title text also points to another flaw in this strategy: multi-player gaming requires other players, so if you play a game five years after its release, there's often nobody else to play with. It's even worse with online gaming, as the company hosting the online server may have shut it down a long time ago. The idea that some games change over time was revisited in [[2189: Old Game Worlds]]. However, {{w|StarCraft (video game)|some game communities}} do last longer than others.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is standing.
