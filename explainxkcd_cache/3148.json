Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n100% All Achievements is a category of {{w|Speedrunning|video game speedruns}} where the goal is to do everything possible in the game, as fast as possible. Many games have a progress bar to track completion of the game, making the \"100%\" criterion officially defined. \"Achievements,\" also known as \"trophies\" for games on Sony-branded consoles, are another way to track accomplishments, either tracked within the game itself or through the storefront used to purchase the game such as the Microsoft Store.\n\nCueball is attempting a 100% All Achievements run for his university, which is a ridiculous pursuit for several reasons. Even though 100% runs for video games can take very long (up to [https://www.speedrun.com/baten_kaitos_eternal_wings_and_the_lost_ocean?h=100&x=mke7v926 two weeks]), they don't even come close to the amount of time needed to complete a single university major, let alone every class. This would be prohibitively expensive for most people due to the high cost of university attendance. Moreover, \"All Achievements\" is vaguely defined in this scenario, since the \"achievements\" possible at a university will change over the period of time involved, as courses are updated, revalidated, added and removed every year in a typical institution. In contrast, even if the possible achievements in a video game change as updates and downloadable content are released, it is possible to specify a particular version of the game used for the speedrun.\n\nGen-ed refers to {{w|Curriculum#Core_curriculum|general education courses}}. This usually refers to a set of classes that must be taken by all students, regardless of major. Most students typically finish these within their first year, if not their first term. Classes at a university typically receive a code that combines the name of the field/discipline being taught with a two- or three-digit number (e.g., a course in anthropology might be ANTH 209). The leading digit typically provides information about how advanced a class is: lower division work might receive a 0 or 1, while upper division and graduate courses will receive higher numbers. Although there is no standardization across universities for which specific numbers equate to which course levels, the generally accepted baseline education given in any specific subject is usually associated with the number {{w|101 (number)#In_education|101}}, while classes in the 400s would be graduate-level courses at most universities.\n\nIn traditional speedrunning, a {{w|tool-assisted speedrun}} is one done with software such as a video game emulator to perform incredibly precise movements. Such tools generally do not exist for real-life pursuits such as education, so Cueball may have meant using artificial intelligence or similar \"cheats\" to illegitimately complete his work. Unassisted speedruns are typically reviewed in full by a moderator of the speedrunning community for that game to ensure there truly were no tools involved. There is no known community for university speedrunning,{{Citation needed}} so no moderators will be able to review the years of footage to determine whether the speedrun was legitimate.\n\nMost video-sharing services limit the length of uploaded videos, either by size or length, for a variety of reasons. A decade-long video file is almost certainly too big for any service: an hour of 720p-resolution video is about one gigabyte [[https://www.overcasthq.com/blog/how-big-are-video-files/ Overcast]], so a decade would be about 100 terabytes. Currently the longest video on YouTube is just under 25 days [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12095652/trivia/ IMDB]], under 1% of what Cueball wants. Such a video would require significant infrastructure support by the service for it to be allowed, not to mention presenting challenges to recording and storing it in the first place.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[Cueball, arms outstretched, is talking to White Hat.]\n:Cueball: I finished all the gen-ed back in 2010, and I'm up to the 400-level courses in most departments.\n:Cueball: But now one of my advisors is saying I \"can't have more than 20 majors\" and \"need to graduate next year.\"\n:Cueball: It's outrageous!\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:My university is making it really hard to finish a 100% all achievements speedrun.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Video games]]"
