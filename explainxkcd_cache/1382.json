However, this has not yet come to pass,{{Citation needed}} at least for the majority of consumers.\n\nIn this comic, [[Randall]] is pointing out that the problem with personal rocket packs - more commonly called {{w|jet packs}} - is not how to attach a rocket to someone's back, but other practical considerations. One might be how to keep the hot exhaust from burning the user's {{w|Calf_(anatomy)|calves}}. Many {{w|jet pack}} designs actually do have ways to deal with this, such as moving the rockets farther from the user, but there are many other practical issues which have made this an impractical form of travel given current technology.\n\nThe title text starts with the trope \"{{tvtropes|IWantMyJetPack|I want my jet pack}}\", a theme also explored in [[864: Flying Cars]]. It continues with pointing out that if people did start using rocket packs, there would also be more injuries, raising health care costs. That's something that people usually don't consider when imagining a future where these devices are commonplace.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Text above the frame.]\n:Rocket packs are easy.\n:[In the frame: Cueball is lying face down on the ground with his Rocket Packs on his back and his calves severely burned.]\n:Cueball: Ow.\n:[Text below the frame.]\n:The hard part is inventing the calf shields.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]"
