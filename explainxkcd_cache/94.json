Randall notes that these pages fall into one of three categories:\n\n*People without friends or significant others who linked to their {{w|LiveJournal}} (a blogging service popular in the early 2000s);\n*People with friends and significant others who would celebrate their relationship all over their page;\n*People with friends who would fill their profile with inside jokes only their friends could understand.\n\nThe \"Angsty about it\" -> \"Yes you are\" section implies that everybody who does not have a boyfriend or girlfriend is upset and wishes they did.\n\nBoth AIM and LiveJournal were known for their teenage user base, as shown by the title text's fictional AIM screen name.\n\nThe title text seems to reference the kind of behavior someone with a tribute page would display, but is actually an example of an inside joke, for cartoonists.  The text comes from [http://www.nataliedee.com/index.php?date=010806 Natalie Dee Comic 956, from January 8, 2006], a few months before this xkcd comic was published on April 26 of the same year.\n\n==Transcript==\n[A flowchart is shown.]\n:Have Friends? → No → Link to your LiveJournal\n:Have Friends? → Yes, and want to alienate everyone else → Inside jokes!\n:Have Friends? → Yes → Have Boyfriend/ Girlfriend? → \n::No → Angsty about it? → \n:::Yes → Link to your LiveJournal\n:::No → Yes you are → Angsty about it?\n::Yes → A profile tribute is the greatest possible expression of love.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Flowcharts]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]"
