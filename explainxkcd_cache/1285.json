Studies support single spaces!' 'Those results weren't statistically significant!' 'Fine, you win. I'm using double spaces right now!' 'Are not!&nbsp; We can all hear your stupid whitespace.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic refers to the debate occurring in the United States about the correct {{w|Sentence spacing|number of space characters after a period at the end of a sentence}}.\n\nWhile typewriter typists in the United States were traditionally taught to use two spaces between sentences, this is becoming less common and many sources now recommend having only one space, although this topic is still {{w|Sentence spacing#Controversy|controversial}}.\n\n[[Cueball]] is advocating a line break after every sentence, the mysterious \"third way\". \n\nThis obviates the problem, as a period will always appear at the end of a line and the spacing after it becomes moot. \n\nA line break after every sentence is sometimes called \"[http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/ semantic linefeeds]\".\n\nThis is particularly useful when plain text files based on a markup language (such as {{w|HTML}}, {{w|TeX}}, or {{w|Wiki markup}}) are edited by multiple people using a {{w|Revision control|version control system}} where it helps to facilitate comparison of changes and avoid merge conflicts.\n\nIn most markup languages, a single line feed in the source is rendered as a simple space, while two linefeeds generate a paragraph break.\n\nThis approach allows the source to be easily manipulated and versioned, while the rendered output still keeps the regular flow and justification abilities of running text.\n\n(Incidentally, HTML and languages derived from it such as {{w|BBCode}} and {{w|Wiki markup}} will generally render multiple consecutive whitespace characters as a single space, so pretty much every page on the Internet uses single spacing whether the author wants to or not.)\n\nThe title text uses single spaces between the back-and-forth quotations; but within each quotation, the quoted speaker's preferred spacing is used; when the single-spacing advocate claims to be using double spacing, this is indeed a lie.\n\nHowever, realistically, it is implausible that one can hear whitespace.{{Citation needed}}\n\nRandall's mocking characterization in the title text of overzealous advocates using the phrase \"WAKE UP, SHEEPLE\" has appeared in previous comics: [[496: Secretary: Part 3]] and [[1013: Wake Up Sheeple]].\n\nNote that this is not the first time Randall has [[:Category:Compromise|proposed a controversial third way]], and this debate is later referenced in [[1989: IMHO]].\n\nSentence spacing was previously mentioned in the title text of [[1070: Words for Small Sets]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[To the left a group with three Cueballs, a Ponytail and Megan at the front which face another group with two Cueballs, a Ponytail and a black haired ponytail at the front. Each group has a placard. A Cueball in the left group has a cutlass and a Cueball in the right group has a spear as they are angrily facing off against each other. Off to the far right side stands a lone Cueball also with a placard.]\n:Left placard: '''Two''' spaces after a period\n:Middle placard: '''One''' space after a period\n:Right placard: Line break after every sentence\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Sheeple]]\n[[Category:Compromise]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
