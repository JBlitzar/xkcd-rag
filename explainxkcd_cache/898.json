In a major corporation commercially sensitive information is generally hidden from employees at lower levels but available to management, but the systems administrator (who usually sits low on the hierarchy and doesn't manage any other employees) can access not only the sensitive information but the raw data that it's calculated from. Not only that, but the systems administrator is usually responsible for controlling who has access to the information - making them the most powerful person in the company (as far as the IT infrastructure is concerned). Many managers think of themselves as being \"above\" engineers and have trouble coming to grips with this concept.\n\n{{w|Themistocles}}, mentioned at the title text, was an Ancient Greek politician. In the title text is a similar joke placed at the top of the chain of command, this time in Ancient Greece. It refers to Plutarch's [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html#p53 ''Life of Themistocles'']:\n:Of his son, who lorded it over his mother, and through her over himself, he said, jestingly, that the boy was the most powerful of all the Hellenes; for the Hellenes were commanded by the Athenians, the Athenians by himself, himself by the boy's mother, and the mother by her boy.\n\nThe part about television advertisements is a proposal that, by controlling the \"infant sons\" of important political figures (as well as the aforementioned Red Button engineer), one could control said political figures, and thus the entire world. ''{{w|Dora the Explorer}}'' is a bilingual (Spanish/English) educational show for young children, something a busy person like the President (or the  engineer) might turn on for their child, and advertisements are known to influence young kids' decisions.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A flowchart shows the President at the top, with an arrow to the Secretary of Defense, and then fourteen arrows leading to a series of boxes labeled Unified Combat Commanders. On the side, a box with a dotted outline has a dotted arrow leading to the president. It's labeled \"Engineer Who Installed the Red Button.\"]\n:US NUCLEAR CHAIN OF COMMAND\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Flowcharts]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear weapons]]\n[[Category:Engineering]]"
