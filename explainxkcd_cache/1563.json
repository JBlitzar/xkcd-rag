It takes several well-known movies but changes each word of their names into a synonym. So ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' has turned into ''Space Fights'', ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings}}'' into  ''The Jewelry God'' and ''{{w|Star Trek}}'' into ''Space Trip''. All these movies series have the same heading, and then a subtitle. There are ten of them in the comic, and two more in the title text. This comic became a 2-comic series when more movies were spoofed in [[1568: Synonym Movies 2]].\n\nThe use of synonyms makes all these movies look ridiculous, for example, \"The Sword Wizard Is Back\" is a laughable-sounding movie,{{Citation needed}} whereas \"{{w|Return of the Jedi}}\" sounds perfectly reasonable to us. [[Randall]] may be poking fun at movies that have ridiculous titles already, for instance, some people think this applies to a title like \"{{w|Terminator: Genisys}}\".\n\nThe title text refers to the latest Star Wars movie (2015-12-18), after {{w|The Walt Disney Company|Disney}} acquired the movie rights. The movie is called {{w|Star Wars: The Force Awakens}} and has now turned into ''Power Gets Up''. As usual, with any Star Wars-related material, there is a huge fan base that eagerly awaits the new movie. But then again many people fear that it will not live up to their expectations, as was the case with the fourth movie, the first of the three movies in the second installment of Star Wars, {{w|Star Wars: The Phantom Menace}}, dubbed here as ''The Scary Ghost''. As mentioned in the title text, that movie did not live up to the hype.\n\nA similarly humorous effect is achieved in [[1133: Up Goer Five]] which explains the {{w|Saturn V}} rocket, but words and phrases are replaced with synonyms which are chosen from the most common English words. This renders ordinary words like \"rocket\" into \"flying space car\", or \"helium\" into \"funny voice air\" for example.\n\n{{spoiler|Many of the following explanations contain spoilers for ''{{w|Star Wars}}'', ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings}}'', and ''{{w|Star Trek}}''.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Synonym\n! Real Title\n! Explanation\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Space Fights'' (''{{w|Star Wars}}'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''Space Fights: <br/>Sudden Optimism''\n| ''{{w|Star Wars: A New Hope}}''\n| If you suddenly feel optimistic, you could say that you have gained a new hope.\n|-\n| ''Space Fights: <br/>The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;Wins&nbsp;This&nbsp;One''\n| ''{{w|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back|Star Wars: <br/>The Empire Strikes Back}}''\n| In the second Star Wars movie the Empire comes out on top â€” as opposed to the first and third where a Death Star is destroyed at the end of each of the movies. So the government = the Empire, wins that movie.\n|-\n| ''Space Fights: <br/>The Sword Wizard Is Back''\n| ''{{w|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi|Star Wars: <br/>Return of the Jedi}}''\n| In the context of a narrative device, a {{w|jedi}} is a kind of wizard, wielding {{w|The Force (Star Wars)|the Force}} (like magic) and the {{w|lightsaber}} (a kind of sword).\n|-\n| ''Space Fights: <br/>Power Gets Up''\n| ''{{w|Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars: <br/>The Force Awakens}}''\n| From the title text. When you awake, you typically get up (from the bed). Force and power are related terms, but have differences in both [http://www.diffen.com/difference/Force_vs_Power real life] and [http://boards.theforce.net/threads/did-luke-ever-get-those-power-converters-from-tosche-station.20403665/ Star Wars].\n|-\n| ''Space Fights: <br/>The Scary Ghost''\n| ''{{w|Star Wars: The Phantom Menace|Star Wars: <br/>The Phantom Menace}}''\n| From the title text. Ghost = Phantom. A menacing phantom would be quite scary.  It is worth noting that in the original title, \"phantom\" is an adjective referring to the noun \"Menace,\" whereas in Randall's new version it is reversed.  The original meaning would be better preserved by \"Space Fights: The Ghostly Scare\".\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''The Jewelry God'' (''{{w|The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings}}'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''The Jewelry God: <br/>The Jewelry Team''\n| ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Lord of the Rings: <br/>The Fellowship of the Ring}}''\n| The fellowship has become a team in the synonym version. As in the original title, the series name and subtitle differ only by a single noun.\n|-\n| ''The Jewelry God: <br/>Double Houses''\n| ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Lord of the Rings: <br/>The Two Towers}}''\n| Two towers are a heck of a lot bigger than double houses... But at least there are two in either case.\n|-\n| ''The Jewelry God: <br/>We Have a Czar Again''\n| ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King}}''\n| {{w|Tsar|Czar}} was a title for Slavic monarchs and official titles in Bulgaria, Serbia and Russia. It was generally regarded as equivalent to king or somewhat between king and emperor.\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Space Trip'' (''{{w|Star Trek}}'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''Space Trip: The Movie''\n| ''{{w|Star Trek: The Motion Picture|Star Trek: <br/>The Motion Picture}}''\n| Today we would say \"The Movie\" rather than \"The Motion Picture\".\n|-\n| ''Space Trip: <br/>That Guy is Angry''\n| ''{{w|Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan|Star Trek: <br/>The Wrath of Khan}}''\n| {{w|Khan Noonien Singh|Khan}} (a fictional villain in the series) is now just ''That Guy'', and wrath has been turned down to merely anger.\n|-\n| ''Space Trip: <br/>Where is the Vulcan?''\n| ''{{w|Star Trek: The Search for Spock|Star Trek: <br/>The Search for Spock}}''\n| {{w|Spock}} is of the alien race {{w|Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan}}, and the search has turned into the question ''where is he?''\n|-\n| ''Space Trip: <br/>Let's Go Back''\n| ''{{w|Star Trek: The Voyage Home|Star Trek: <br/>The Voyage Home}}''\n| When you decide to travel home you could also say let's go back.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ten DVDs on a shelf.
