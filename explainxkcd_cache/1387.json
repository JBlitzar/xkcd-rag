This is most commonly a television broadcast, though radio broadcasts and newspaper headlines are also used. Sometimes attention is drawn to such a news story, and in other cases, it's subtle foreshadowing that can easily be missed. In any event, if news reporting shows up in fiction, savvy viewers will immediately expect it to become relevant to the plot in short order.\n\nOf course, in real life, news stories generally don't directly and obviously impact the lives of most people viewing them. [[Randall]] suggests that life will seem a lot more ominous if we imagine every news story as happening in the background of a movie, which would make us instinctively assume that they foreshadow something that will soon impact us directly. \n\nIn this case we see three random headings from news stories, all of which are fairly mundane in real life, but which would seem highly foreboding in a movie: \n\n*''[http://www.northkoreannews.net/index.php/sid/223255811/scat/08aysdf7tga9s7f7/ht/Angry-North-Korea-threatens-war-if-US-shows-film-mocking-its-leader North Korea threatens U.S. over upcoming movie]'' comes from {{w|North Korea|North Korea's}} official {{w|Korean Central News Agency}} which, shortly before this comic was released, threatened the US over the {{w|Seth Rogen}} movie {{w|The Interview (2014 film)|The Interview}}, promising \"stern\" and \"merciless\" retaliation if the film was released. North Korea is well-known for making blustering and empty threats, and few people feared a serious response, but in a movie, this would foreshadow either all-out war or an attack that would involve the protagonists somehow. \n\n*''[http://dailydigestnews.com/2014/06/north-atlantic-ocean-great-white-shark-population-booms/ Shark populations booming off east coast]'' comes from a report released week before this comic, about the preservation of {{w|Great white shark|Great White sharks}}. A growing population of Great White sharks is positive news as the species is important to marine ecosystems and its numbers have declined in recent years. Sharks aren't a significant threat to humans, with fewer than a dozen humans killed by sharks in a typical year, worldwide. In a movie, however, such a report would heavily imply that a shark attack, or something similar, was imminent. \n\n*''[http://www.orbcomm.com/networks/og2-launch SpaceX to attempt new rocket launch today]''. {{w|SpaceX}} is a privately owned space transport services company. On March 13, 2014 they reported a launch date for their first {{w|Orbcomm satellites#Orbcomm-OG2|OG2}} mission containing 6 satellites. While interesting to space enthusiasts, this is a fairly ordinary update about the progress of the company. In a movie, such a report would imply that the launch would become important to the plot in some way, which could involve the protagonists going into space, a crash or explosion affecting them, the rocket encountering some extraterrestrial threat, or SpaceX technology being used as a threat against humanity. \n\n\nThe title text news ''[http://nypost.com/2014/06/26/sherri-shepherd-jenny-mccarthy-leave-the-view/ hosts were unexpectedly fired from ABC's 'The View' today]'' references {{w|American Broadcasting Company|ABC's}} ''{{w|The View (U.S. TV series)|The View}}'' where two of the co-hosts, {{w|Sherri Shepherd}} and {{w|Jenny McCarthy}}, were simultaneously reporting leaving the program the day before this comic appeared. In real life, this is a very mundane story which has little impact on the lives of most people. In a film, however, it becomes loaded with meaning. In a workplace drama, it could mean that the protagonist might have a chance to replace those fired leads. In a political thriller, it might be revealed that the hosts were fired to keep them from revealing sensitive information. In an action movie, those fired hosts could be involved in a deadly plot that will soon involve the protagonists. By placing real-world headlines into a fictional context, even low-stakes stories can become rich with potential meaning.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Heading and text above the panel:]\n:'''Today's News'''\n:North Korea threatens U.S. over upcoming movie\n:Shark populations booming off east coast\n:SpaceX to attempt new rocket launch today\n:[Arrow pointing down towards the comics only panel.]\n\n:[Cueball, holding a towel, walks past a TV with a news report shown on-screen.]\n:Cueball: Bye!
