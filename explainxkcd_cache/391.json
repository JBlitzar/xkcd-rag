I didn't think it was possible.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n''{{w|The Game (mind game)|The Game}}'' is a {{w|memetic}}. The rules are as follows:\n\n#Everybody in the world who knows about The Game is playing The Game. (Or: ''Everyone'' is playing The Game.)\n#If you think of The Game, you lose The Game.\n#If you lose The Game, you must announce that you lost. This is often done by loudly announcing something like \"I/You lost The Game,\" or \"I lost.\" \n#:This usually causes other people within earshot who are playing the game to think of the game, causing them to lose the game as well, which may cause a chain reaction with people all around announcing that they lost the game. \n#:Additionally it will make people ask about the game, which will make them new players, once it is explained to them.\n#Once you stop thinking about The Game, you are back in, and can lose again.\n\nFrom the simple way the rules are set up, there seems to be no such thing as ''winning'' The Game, except possibly by permanently forgetting about its existence. This comic gives you an alternative way to win, by simply telling you that you win and are now free from the memetic. An alternate interpretation may be that reading this comic causes you to ''lose'' the game, because it reminds you of The Game, and that Randall is simply trolling.\n\nThe Game is often thought of as a sort of contagious psychological trap, hence the term \"Mindvirus\". There is, however, a crucial escape point: The rules of the Game stipulate that if you know about it, you are playing it; but if you decide not to play, then there is no reason to obey the rules. You can simply decide of your own accord that you are not playing. This may be against the rules, but you don't need to follow the rules, because you're not playing The Game.\n\nThe title text states that [[Randall]] didn't know it was possible to win The Game, and he was surprised just as much as the reader.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The comic is a simple box with text.]\n:'''You Just <u>WON</u> The Game.'''\n:It's okay! You're free!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Psychology]]"
