There were no aurora visible from my house and that comet evaporated. They'd better not cancel the 2017 eclipse.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nMany news organizations will recap the major stories of the past calendar year in late December (typically before the year has actually ended). This includes specialized news outlets such as sports stations which recap major sports stories or best plays of the year. Here, [[Cueball]],  as a [[:Category:News anchor|news anchor]], expects [[Megan]] to talk about major news stories of 2013 such as the roll-out of {{w|Obamacare}}, the {{w|Papal conclave, 2013|election}} of {{w|Pope Francis}} or the {{w|Death of Nelson Mandela|death}} of {{w|Nelson Mandela}}, to give a few examples. \n\nInstead, Megan only recaps one thing which was important to her: She did not see the {{w|aurora borealis}} (i.e. northern lights) in 2013, the dazzling natural geomagnetic light display caused by the {{w|solar wind}}. In 2013 a solar maximum was expected at its {{w|solar cycle}}, but the activity of the sun wasn't as heavy as before. So, a ''northern light'' had been very rare in this year. Megan has never seen the northern lights, and she is frustrated that it did not happen for her in 2013, thus overshadowing all other events. She even leaves in the middle of the review when she notices the sky clearing up, as she wishes to check if there are any northern light this evening. This may very well be [[Randall|Randall's]] own frustration which is displayed here. \n\nIt turns out in the title text that Megan is actually reviewing the astronomical year, only considering astronomical events. She even rates it much like a movie review, although she seems to use the {{w|Academic grading in the United States|A-F grade scale}}. She only gives the year a C- (C minus), which would usually be the lowest passable grade, so she just lets the year pass in spite of the two failing events mentioned in the title text.\n\nIn the title text, Megan specifically complains about not being able to see aurorae from her house. If Megan actually represents Randall's frustration, then to expect to see it from a house in Massachusetts would be a lot to ask for. Usually, people who wish to see Northern lights will travel to an arctic area and stay away from light pollution from cities. But in years with heavy solar activity, northern light may be visible even south of Massachusetts.\n\nThe title text also refers to {{w|Comet ISON}}. In February, a rough estimate of the comet's behavior predicted that it would become brighter than the full moon, a prediction that was widely reported by the media even though it was based on limited data and astronomers knew that it would not reach this brightness. In the end, although it was visible to the naked eye, it was never as bright as anybody hoped and apparently disintegrated on November 28, 2013, at its close approach to the sun.\n\nThe title text also refers to the {{w|2017 total eclipse}}, which was visible as a partial eclipse for a few hours throughout North America on August 21 Monday, including a 100-mile wide band across the United States where it was a total {{w|eclipse}} for a couple of minutes in the early afternoon. Eclipses are completely predictable - although the weather might be cloudy so that the sun is blocked during totality, they will happen anyway. So Megan is being extremely pessimistic to even suggest that the 2017 eclipse might get canceled. Humorously, her statement that someone might decide to cancel the eclipse makes it sound like a concert that could be canceled by the organizer. It seems that Megan thinks that the \"they\" who could cancel the eclipse are the same \"they\" that caused the comet to disintegrate and the solar activity to stay low. Anyone with the kind of power to stop a solar eclipse from happening would be god-like compared to humanity. The next time that the eclipse was mentioned was in the New Year comic for 2017: [[1779: 2017]]. The subject of the title text of that comic is the likelihood that the eclipse will indeed happen as planned.\n\nAll in all, the comic suggests that the only events of significance to Megan (and Randall) are astronomical ones; the actions of humanity pale in comparison.\n\nThe joke of Megan answering a question in an interview in an unexpected manner has been used before in [[1111: Premiere]].\n\nInterestingly in [[1037: Umwelt]] there is an [[1037#Aurora|aurora story line]] where Megan stays inside at her computer even though it can be seen from her own state, letting her friend go out alone. (So not the same Megan for sure).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is a news anchor sitting with his arms on a desk looking at Megan, a reporter shown in a feed on a screen to his right. There is a title below the feed.]\n:Cueball: We go live to our ''2013: Year in Review!''\n:Megan: Thanks! \n:Megan: In 2013, I didn't see an aurora.\n:Cueball: I- what?\n:Title: Year <small>in</small> Review\n\n:[Zoom to the top part of the screen with Megan. Her text is written above the screen without a frame around this segment of the comic.]\n:Megan: The northern lights. I thought this would finally be the year. \n:Megan: But it didn't happen.\n\n:[Back to the original view but Cueball has turned more towards Megan, with only one arm on the desk.]\n:Cueball: Oh. Uh... What about the rest of the year?\n:Megan: What do you mean?\n:Cueball: Any big news stories?\n:Megan: Oh yeah, tons.\n:Title: Year <small>in</small> Review\n\n:[Same setting but Megan turns away from Cueball, who has taken both hands of the table. Megan is looking to her left at something off screen. Beat panel.]\n:Title: Year <small>in</small> Review\n\n:[Cueball turns back to face the viewers, both hands back on the desk, as Megan is leaving the screen, walking out to the right, her face already hidden by the frame of the feed.]\n:Cueball: ...Well, that was ''2013: Year in Review.''\n:Megan: The sky's clearing up.
