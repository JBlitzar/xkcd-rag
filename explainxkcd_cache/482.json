The comic is a direct companion piece to [[485: Depth]], also released on a Monday the week after this one. ''Depth'' similarly uses the logarithmic scale to depict the Earth at progressively greater magnification (going \"deeper\" down), from Earth's surface (the grass) to the interior of a single proton.\n\nThe very top (edge) of the observable universe is described as being 46 billion {{w|light years}} above the Earth. The universe is \"only\" about {{w|Age of the universe|13.8 billion years old}}, so the {{w|cosmic background radiation}} that reaches the Earth today has also only traveled 13.8 billion light years. However, during that time, {{w|Metric expansion of space|the universe has expanded}}, so the galaxies that formed from that spot where this background radiation was emitted 13.8 billion years ago would now be 46 billion light years away. This has led to many {{w|Observable_universe#Misconceptions_on_its_size|misconceptions regarding the size}}, the most typical being that the radius of the observable universe is \"only\" 13.8 billion light years. See this video, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXfhGxZFcVE How Do You Measure the Size of the Universe?]'', for a great explanation of the 46 billion light years.\n\nTo the right of the text, [[Black Hat]] stands atop the comic, having just dropped a cat off the edge head first; he is clearly going to test if the cat will land on its feet, being a jerk per his usual character. It will take some time, though, before the cat reaches Earth.... \n\nAs one scrolls down, the depicted distances become less compressed, until arriving at the surface of Earth, all the while approaching a 1:1 scale with real-life distances. As shown in [[1162: Log Scale]], if [[Randall]] didn't do this, the comic would be much, MUCH longer.\n\nIn this comic, most objects that are grounded on Earth are scaled logarithmically on the vertical axes and linearly on the horizontal axes (some are scaled linearly on both axes). Displaying objects in this manner noticeably distorts their shape; the Great Pyramid, for instance, looks not like a pyramid but like a bullet. \n\nOutside of the Earth's atmosphere, the objects are placed at their actual distances from Earth on the log scale, but their shapes are not subjected to the logarithmic scaling of Earth objects, instead appearing as they would be seen (otherwise, round objects like the sun would appear more egg shaped, with the flatter side facing upward). However, objects are still much larger or much smaller than they would be in real life, in order to allow them to be properly seen.\n\nIn the title text, Randall muses on how the inwardly-curved sides of the {{w|Eiffel Tower}} might actually become perfectly straightened when subjected to this logarithmic distortion. Although it is shown to bulge in the comic proper, this may be a consequence of Randall's rough art style rather than any reflection of his beliefs. The actual shape of the Tower approximates an {{w|Exponential function|exponential curve}}, which would indeed give a straight line on a log scale, although it was actually designed by {{w|Gustave Eiffel}} to minimize wind resistance rather than to be mathematically exact (the design is so perfect that the amount the Tower sways in the wind is less than the amount it is distorted due to thermal expansion of the sunlit side).\n\n===Objects===\nAll objects are sorted from bottom to top by their maximum distance from earth for objects in a solar orbit, and their current distance for others.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2015, the {{w|Cassini probe}} sampled material thought to be from Enceladus' geysers, and scientists have found evidence that its subsurface ocean closely resembles a particular kind of deep sea hydrothermal environment on Earth known to harbor life.\n\nA more distant possibility is that Randall is referencing Saturn's largest (and much more well known moons) {{w|Titan (moon)|Titan}}, the only known moon to have an atmosphere and lakes. It was long predicted that there may be bodies of liquid on the surface filled with liquid methane and ethane (Titan is too cold for liquid water and life as we know it, but ethane and methane remain a liquid at those temperatures). There is some speculation that exotic forms of life based on extremely cold exotic chemistries may form in such conditions, with liquid hydrocarbons playing the role of the solvent (the role water plays in terrestrial life).\n|-\n| 928&nbsp;×10<sup>9</sup>m\n | {{w|Jupiter}} \n| Jupiter is displayed along with its moons.
