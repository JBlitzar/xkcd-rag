This comic was released two days after such a supermoon and there was a hype in 2014 because there were [https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/10jul_supermoons three supermoons in a row] as NASA said.\n\nA supermoon is an informal astronomical event where a full moon occurs when it is closest to earth, causing the moon to appear 10% brighter and about 7% larger than the '''average''' full moon appears. This is due to the {{w|apsidal precession}} of moon's {{w|elliptic orbit}} which has an {{w|orbital eccentricity}} of about 0.0549. The conditions for a supermoon happen once every 411&nbsp;days, and the loose definition of the term means that the supermoon lasts for about two or three full moons.\n\nReturning to the not-so-Superman, the average American adult man is 69&nbsp;inches tall, with a {{w|standard deviation}} of 2.9&nbsp;inches. Not-so-Superman, at an assumed 74&nbsp;inches (188&nbsp;cm) tall, is within the 94th percentile - certainly a tall man, but by no means phenomenal. Basketball players, by way of example, are often more than 80&nbsp;inches tall. \"7% stronger\" (most likely a reference to how the supermoon is 7% larger) is a bit harder to quantify, but it communicates \"not actually impressive\" to the reader all the same. For example, if an average man can lift 50&nbsp;kg, the not-so-Superman would lift 53.5&nbsp;kg.\n\nThe comic's title makes use of an asterisk that is being used as a wildcard. When using search queries an asterisk represents one or more characters. Therefore, Superm*n can represent the strings \"Superman\" and \"Supermoon,\" as well as \"Supermen,\" \"Supermoan,\" and \"Supermax prison\".\n\nThe title text refers  makes this same comparison with {{w|Spider-Man}}. Spider-Man is capable of firing large amounts of webbing, can cling to surfaces with superhuman gripping abilities, and has a sixth sense, \"spider sense\", that warns him about impending danger. The title text describes trivially minimal versions of these powers, analogous to the trivial size and brightness difference between a \"supermoon\" and a normal full moon. This also shows a much more accurate depiction of an actual spider's abilities, where they can produce several inches of a thin web, not the unrealistic amounts depicted in use by Spider-Man (usually by technical means, though occasionally [https://screenrant.com/tobey-maguire-spiderman-organic-webshooters/ organically]).\n\nSupermoon is also referenced in [[1052: Every Major's Terrible#Verse 3|panel 25]] of [[1052: Every Major's Terrible]] and shortly thereafter in [[1080: Visual Field]]. In both cases displaying the same distaste for the formulation. Although not as clearly as here. Since then other comics have referred to the term, see this [[:Category:Supermoon|list]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is reaching for an item on a high shelf.
