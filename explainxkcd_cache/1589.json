In it, Victor Frankenstein is a human who creates a {{w|Frankenstein%27s_monster#Names|monster}} (who is never named).  In popular culture, however, \"Frankenstein\" is taken to be the name of the monster, not its creator. The novel is later mentioned in [[2604: Frankenstein Captcha]] and [[2799: Frankenstein Claim Permutations]].\n\nWhile this is an often-corrected \"error\", it has been argued that it is not technically incorrect to call the monster \"Frankenstein\" as well, since he is the \"offspring\" of his \"father\", Victor Frankenstein. Since a child usually takes on the last name of their father, it may be said that the monster's last name actually ''is'' \"Frankenstein\". He also refers to himself in the novel as \"the Adam of your labors\" - a reference to the Biblical Adam, the first of his kind - and some have taken to calling the monster \"Adam Frankenstein\" to differentiate him from the scientist, Victor Frankenstein.\n\nOthers have argued that the monster's namelessness is an important part of his characterization in the story since it reflects the doctor's complete rejection of his creation. While the monster identifies Victor as his \"father\" in the novel, Victor does not consider the creature to be his \"son\".\n\nNot helping matters is the equally-famous ''Frankenstein'' film series staring Boris Karloff, featuring a very different plotline and a very different portrayal of the monster. Within the movies themselves the monster once again goes unnamed, but the movie titles and posters refer to the monster simply as \"Frankenstein.\" For example the 1935 film ''{{w|Bride of Frankenstein}}'' is a double-meaning, featuring brides for both the human Henry Frankenstein and the monster, thus implying the monster can be called \"Frankenstein.\"\n\n[[Randall]] apparently finds this argument tedious and pedantic, so he has created his own work of fiction, in which the monster is named Frankenstein. He rationalizes that it is now correct to call the monster Frankenstein, assuming that his comic strip is as authoritative as the original novel. \"{{w|Canon (fiction)|Canonical}}\" (rule, standard) means that this comic should be used as the authoritative work on the naming of the monster. \n\nHowever, xkcd's ''Frankenstein'' would be unlikely to be accepted by anyone as canonical, except for its stated purpose of settling the naming argument. The original version of any story is usually assumed to be the canonical one, and any derivative work would have to have widespread influence and recognition to supplant it in the popular imagination. This is not likely to happen with xkcd's ''Frankenstein,'' as it makes almost no effort to stand on its own; it exists only to be a version of ''Frankenstein'' where the monster is named \"Frankenstein.\" It emphasizes this point several times, and ends within a single panel, having accomplished its only goal. Almost no readers would find this version entertaining or substantive enough to displace Mary Shelley's original as the definitive version of the story.\n\nThe {{w|Public_domain|copyright}} on Mary Shelley's novel has expired long ago, before the moon landings (which began in 1969), so it is perfectly legal to create works derived from the original story. It should be noted, however, that Universal holds the copyright on the common [https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2011/10/24/how-universal-re-copyrighted-frankensteins-monster/ image of the monster] (green skin, flat-top head, scar, bolts on the neck and protruding forehead). To qualify as a {{w|derivative work}} the story needs to be substantially different from the original. The monster believing in {{w|moon landing conspiracy theories}} would probably qualify, but may reference retellings of the tale where a damaged or deranged brain was used (as an alternate 'explanation' why the supposedly perfect creation inevitably runs amok). Additionally, the original Frankenstein's monster was seen by its creator as hideous and repulsive due to its physical appearance despite the project being a success. Randall makes the same correlation in his version by having Frankenstein claim the moon landings were faked, which produces the same feelings in The Doctor.\n\nAlternatively, the monster being a moon landing denier is meant as a throwaway absurdist non sequitur. As the only point of this story is to make a canonical version of ''Frankenstein'' where \"Frankenstein\" is the monster's name, it should logically end once it has finished making that point clear. However, Randall throws a curveball by having the monster blurt out an uncomfortable and controversial point of view before the ending, then ending the story abruptly before the monster's statements can be addressed.\n\nIt is also possible that Randall is making reference to the fact that the kind of people who become engrossed in the debate that is attempted to be resolved in this comic and would bother to create a piece like this (which incidentally, complicates matters further rather than simplifying it, similar to the effect of many pieces of evidence in internet discussions) could be compared to the kind of people who deny the Moon Landings in obscure forums. He is drawing attention to how inane and unnecessary the comic is.\n\nThe title text raises the question of what the monster's creator is named in this version, since the name \"Frankenstein\" is instead given to the monster. The canonical answer is that the creator is simply \"The Doctor\", like the title character of the series {{w|Doctor_Who|\"Doctor Who\"}}. This might be a reference to similar pedantic nitpicking that occurs when that character is incorrectly referred to as \"Doctor Who\" rather than \"The Doctor\" which is in turn referenced in comic [[1221: Nomenclature]]. As it happens, people who make that mistake can also claim canonical support, in that some early episodes of the series list the character's name as \"Doctor Who\" in the credits, or reference the recharacterization in the {{w|Dr. Who (Dalek films)|cinematic retellings}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A text only panel.
