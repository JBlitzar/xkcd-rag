This is demonstrated by [[Megan]] explaining the whole concept to an energy sphere representing a non-humanoid intelligence; when framed the way Megan explains it, the explanation sounds rather trivial and silly. A better explanation would be to say that some chemicals make humans faster and stronger but also damage the human body, so these chemicals are banned so the competitors won't destroy themselves. Another point Megan has missed is that the competitions aren't unrestricted, they're designed around specific rules and structures, to which all participants agree. The chemicals in question are a violation of those rules, and so are both dishonest and subvert the entire purpose of the competition. \n\nThis comic is one of many instances where [[Randall]] attempts to trivialize sports.\n\nThe title text changes the perspective again by suggesting that humanity itself is trivial in the grand scheme of things and that really all we are is a \"transition\" state between old dust and new dust, with a bunch of emailing in between. This is a version of the saying that the Universe is just trying to turn itself into Iron, which is the atom with least energy, and it can thus neither be fused in stars or decay radioactively.\n\nThe comic was published on {{w|Ash Wednesday}} (Western liturgical start of Lent). The dust to dust reference calls to mind the charge, \"Remember man that thou art dust and unto dust you shall return,\" which is traditionally spoken by priests as they place ashes on the foreheads of observers on Ash Wednesday, in addition to the idea that all atoms in the universe other than Hydrogen, Helium, and some Lithium, were created after the big-bang via {{w|Stellar nucleosynthesis}}, with further production and dispersal via {{w|Supernova nucleosynthesis}}. Thus the reference by {{w|Joni Mitchell}} in the song {{w|Woodstock (song)|Woodstock}}: \"We are stardust...\"; and echoed by {{w|Carl Sagan}}: \"We are star stuff.\"\n\nSimilar talking floating energy spheres have been used later to represent super intelligent AIs both in [[1450: AI-Box Experiment]] and [[2635: Superintelligent AIs]], where it is clearly a different sphere and then in the [[:Category:Time traveling Sphere|Time traveling Sphere]] series. There is no indication of it here, but the sphere here could be another time traveler as well, back to try and understand humanity.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is walking while an energy sphere (Sphere) floats behind her and talks to her. The sphere is black but surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments that are shaded gray. The white parts in between makes it look like it irradiates light out along these lines.]\n:Sphere: ''Explain to me this \"steroid scandal.\"''\n\n:[Zoom in on Megan's face while she holds a hand to her chin.]\n:Megan: Well, uh... \n:Megan: We humans are sacks of chemicals which stay alive by finding other chemicals and putting them inside us.\n\n:[Megan has turned around facing towards the Sphere to the left. She holds up one hand palm up.]\n:Megan: We hold contests to see which humans are fastest and strongest.\n:Megan: But some humans eat chemicals that make them ''too'' fast and strong.\n\n:[Megan still facing the Sphere holds her arms out.]\n:Megan: And they '''win contests!'''\n:Sphere: ''That does sound bad.''\n:Megan: It's ''awful!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Sport]]"
