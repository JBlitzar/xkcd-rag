The implied premise of the comic is that Cueball intended to send his own DNA to one of the several companies that analyze human DNA samples and provide a report as to the genetic history of that person - examples include notable/famous ancestors or relatives, ethnic background, risk factors for certain medical conditions, etc. However, the result that Cueball receives is consistent with a report for a {{w|purebred dog|dog pedigree}} test, breaking down the percentage of certain breeds present in a dog's ancestry. [[Megan]] suggests that Cueball has sent his sample to the wrong company. Cueball appears to agree in principle, but (seriously or jokingly - it is unclear) indicates that he intends to hedge his bets and avoid chocolate just in case he actually is, in fact, a dog. Dogs are generally susceptible to {{w|theobromine poisoning|poisoning from theobromine}}, a compound found in chocolates which causes seizures and heart failure in dogs (and many other creatures). Basically, if Cueball really is a dog, then eating chocolate could kill him.\n\nThis comic mirrors a real life example of this [https://interestingengineering.com/culture/consumer-dna-testing-company-gets-duped-by-dog-dna where a man sent in three DNA samples] to a Canadian company (Viaguard Accu-Metrics) claiming to be able to distinguish between Aboriginal (Canadian Indian/Indigenous peoples) tribes. Two of the samples was of his own DNA, however one of the samples was of a dog's DNA. The company claimed that both him and the dog were 20% Aboriginal. It claimed that they were 12% Abenaki and 8% Mohawk. Later, CNN sent in DNA from people who had confirmed ancestry in India and Russia, while other DNA testing companies got their ancestry correct, Viaguard Accu-Metrics also claimed that both the Russian and the Indian had 20% Aboriginal ancestry.\n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-human-DNA-is-shared-with-other-things 82%] or [http://www.thehumangenome.co.uk/THE_HUMAN_GENOME/Primer.html 94%] of genes (depending on how you measure it) are shared between humans and dogs. National Geographic erroneously reported that only [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1207_051207_dog_genome.html 5%] of human DNA is shared with dogs and mice, which may have misled Randall Munroe. This leads to several possible interpretations of the comic: It is possible (as Cueball suggests in the last panel) that he is, in fact, a dog with excellent human impersonation skills, or that he somehow shares DNA with a dog. It is possible that Cueball mistakenly sent a sample of a dog's DNA (perhaps his own) somehow thinking that is the method of testing ''his own'' DNA. Perhaps Cueball submitted his own (human) DNA to a dog pedigree company and their method of testing includes a presumption of dog DNA, and therefore was able to produce this result from Cueball's sample. Or perhaps this comic is a suggestion that some DNA test companies are scams that do not even perform DNA tests, but simply send out arbitrary reports that are not based on any testing.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that certain dog breeds are more or less susceptible to disease. The diseases he mentions, {{w|elbow dysplasia}}, {{w|Dirofilaria immitis|heartworm}}, {{w|parvovirus|parvo virus}} and {{w|mange}} are several diseases that can end up killing, disfiguring or disabling dogs, but which humans are generally not susceptible to. As noted above, ancestry DNA test results can inform people about their genetic risk factors for disease, either by specifically investigating your own DNA for those risk factors or, more likely (and less costly) by informing of what risk factors are generally prevalent in your ancestry or others people sharing the same ancestry as you.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking to each other.]\n:Cueball: I sent a DNA sample to one of those \"Trace your ancestry\" projects.\n:Megan: How legit are those?\n:Cueball: No idea. I just figured it'd be fun.\n\n:Six weeks later...\n:[Cueball walks towards Megan with a letter in his hand.]\n:Cueball: Sweet, got my results back.\n:Megan: Ooh, share!\n\n:<u>Ancestry Report</u>\n::48% Labrador Retriever\n::35% Beagle\n::12% Cocker Spaniel\n::5% Other\n\n:[Megan is holding the report.]\n:Megan: I think you sent your sample to the wrong service.\n:Cueball: Just in case, I should probably start avoiding chocolate.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
