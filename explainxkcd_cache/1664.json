Those fields you see are just the stalks of a fungus that's controlling our brains to make us want to spread it.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are studying a {{w|fungus}} that takes over the brains of mammals and makes them want to study the fungus. This is a reproductive tactic by the fungus, since the fungus makes the mammal whose brain it took over want to study the fungus, which means that mammal will need to produce more of the fungus to study it. Cueball and Megan are most likely themselves being controlled by the fungus, since they tell [[Ponytail]] that they want to cultivate the fungus as much as possible.\n\nThe title of the comic refers to {{w|Mycology}}, the study of fungi.\n\nThis is likely a reference to various parasitic species of ''{{w|Cordyceps}}'' fungi, which can infect the brains of insects causing behavior advantageous to the reproduction or spread of the fungus. This also may be an allusion to another fungus, ''{{w|Ophiocordyceps unilateralis}}'', which manipulates its hosts to aid its propagation.\n\n''{{w|Toxoplasma gondii}}'' is also known to alter the behavior of mammals, and some researchers have proposed that this parasite may be partly responsible for the \"{{w|Cat lady}}\" phenomenon, whereby humans are compelled to hoard cats. The comic and its subtitle may, in fact, be a subtle argument that human behavior, and the entire concept of free will, may need to be re-evaluated given the massive numbers of {{w|Human parasites}} known to exist.\n\nIn {{w|evolutionary biology}}, the phenomenon of an organism influencing its environment, sometimes by modifying the behavior of other organisms, is known as “the extended phenotype”. {{w|Richard Dawkins}} wrote a {{w|the Extended Phenotype|book of that name}} (as a follow-up of “{{w|The Selfish Gene}}”) where he describes this mechanism as an extreme example of the so-called selfishness of genes.\n\nThe title text parodies numerous {{w|Conspiracy_theory|conspiracy theories}}, by suggesting that {{w|corn}}, which has been propagated by humans throughout large parts of the world, is actually just a fungus that has used humans, and is not a grain at all. This type of theory is remarkably similar to the {{w|Brain in a Vat}} thought experiment, and to the {{w|Isaac Asimov}} short story {{w|Each an Explorer}}. In both cases something has affected the perception of the mind itself, making it impossible to discern the true reality of something.\n\nThis is quite similar to an argument made in the book {{w|Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind|''Sapiens''}}. Author Yuval Noah Harari points out that domesticated crops are among the most successful life forms on the planet, in terms of propagation.  These plants have influenced humans to do everything in our considerable power to spread their seeds, eliminate competing plants and animals, and even provide fertilizer and irrigation to help them grow and spread. From the perspective of the plants, they've domesticated us, rather than the other way around. This differs from Randall's conspiracy theory, in that domesticated plants provide us with food in exchange for propagation, making this more like {{w|symbiosis}} than {{w|parasitism}}.\n\nConspiracy theories are a [[:Category:Conspiracy theory|recurring subject]] on xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are talking to Ponytail.]\n:Megan: Our lab is studying a fungus that takes over mammal brains and makes them want to study fungi.\n:Cueball: It's very promising! We're opening a whole new wing of the lab just to cultivate it!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Conspiracy theory]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Animals]] <!--Mammals-->\n[[Category:Food]] <!--Title text-->\n[[Category:Mycology]]"
