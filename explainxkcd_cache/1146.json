But I'll figure it out soon!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe phrase \"let's be honest here—\" is often used to soften a statement that might otherwise seem crass. Before [[Cueball]] can finish his sentence, he is interrupted by his friend, who takes the opportunity to honestly state his deepest feelings.\n\nThe human condition is essentially terrifying. Try to keep up appearances.\n\nIt is possible that Cueball's friend's last response, \"Sorry,\" (which is on response to Cueball saying, \"Too honest. Scale it back.\") is insincere as a way of scaling his honesty back by not being honest in his next statement.\n\nThe title text could be a reference to {{w|angst}}, a word used in English to describe an intense feeling of panic — but the friend of Cueball proposes to work on a better understanding on his own fears.\n\nRandall has mentioned having ADD, such as in [[1106: ADD]]. People with neurological or psychological problems such as ADD often express having trouble with things in everyday life that other people seem to find easy.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cueballs are walking.]\n:Cueball: I mean, let's be honest here-\n:Friend: Ok.\n\n:[The friend is talking with his palm out.]\n:Friend: I don't understand why anything happens and I'm confused and scared and trying really hard all the time.\n\n:[The two Cueballs look at each other.]\n:Cueball: ...Too honest.\n:Cueball: Scale it back.\n:Friend: Sorry.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
