[[Cueball]] is asked by doctor [[Ponytail]] to compare the pain in his arm with the worst pain that he can imagine; however, a one-to-ten scale is not useful for Cueball because in his imagination the worst possible pain reduces him to a huddled ball, makes him forget his injured arm, and rescales his current pain to a 1. Apparently, he has the capacity to imagine pain so intense that it dwarfs any possible real-world pain, thus skewing the scale, and this is what his friend [[Megan]] refers to when Ponytail asks what is wrong with his imagination. (According to the [http://xkcd.com/883/info.0.json official transcript] Megan is the patient's friend, and Ponytail is a doctor). A similar doctor Ponytail is shown in [[996: Making Things Difficult]] with Megan and again in [[1713: 50 ccs]] along with both Cueball and Megan. In [[647: Scary]] Cueball (as [[Rob]]) also ends up in such a huddled up position.\n\nThe title text further emphasizes that idea: If the pain was higher than ''one'' on his pain scale, it would already be so high that he would be reduced to uncontrollable, unending screaming.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail in a doctor's coat is carrying a clipboard and consulting with Cueball, who's sitting on a high medical table one arm down the other holding on to this arm at the inside of the elbow.]\n:Ponytail: Any pain?\n:Cueball: My arm really hurts.\n\n:[Zoom out of same scene to include Megan is standing behind Ponytail.]\n:Ponytail: How would you rate the pain, from one to ten, where ten is the worst pain you can imagine?\n\n:[This frame-less panel zooms in on Cueball sitting on the table.]\n:Cueball: The worst pain I can imagine?\n\n:[Zoom in on the top of Cueball who ponders this, raising a thoughtful hand to his jaw.]\n\n:[Same image but Cueball appears to be shocked having taken both hands in front of his mouth, four small lines coming out from the top of his head.]\n\n:[Zoom out again as Cueball huddles up on the table, legs all the way up to his chin, arms tightly folded around the knees. Ponytail leans back towards Megan, both whispering as indicated with smaller font.]\n:Cueball: One.\n:Ponytail: <small>...What the hell is wrong with his imagination?</small>\n:Megan: <small>It's not a normal place.</small>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Doctor Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Medicine]]"
