They not only corroborated your story, but even said you totally mentioned wanting to start a company someday. Sorry! If this isn't enough money, let us know.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nMany people have shared [[Cueball]]'s experience of seeing someone else make a profit from an idea that they themselves had. This comic plays with the thought of what would happen if {{w|intellectual property}} thinking was taken to an extreme, and if companies or people were keener on \"setting things right\" than money. \n\nIn reality, having a great idea alone, of course, does not create a profitable business; there must generally be an enormous amount of effort put in to create a business from scratch, popularize it, and keep it standing. Having done none of this, Cueball would probably not deserve close to the \"30% cut\" he claims even if intellectual property did work the way it is presented here. Multiplying $20,000,000 by 30% gives $6,000,000, which would be a lot of cash for doing nothing but having an idea and telling it to someone. The delivery address is to an address on 'Ash Tree Lane', referencing the space-warping house on the same street from the mysterious '{{w|House of Leaves}}' book.\n\nThe title text is an extension of this story, presumably coming from the company, comedically apologising for not knowing sooner about [[Cueball]]'s idea, and revealing that they corroborated this claim with his friends at a party about this venture, even kindly offering him a larger share of their revenue.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at his desk, pointing at his laptop.]\n:Cueball: Dude! I had this idea like five years ago, and some company just got rich doing it! - I want my cut.\n\n:[Cueball starts typing.]\n:Person off-screen: That's not how it works.\n:Cueball: Sure it is. I'm applying for my share now.\n:Person: Wait, what?\n\n:[A browser window with the title 'Department of Ideas'. It has a series of text boxes.]\n:Date you had the idea:\n::Like five years ago.\n:Proof you had it:\n::I told my friend Mike - you can ask him! I was all \"you know what would make a great business idea?\" and he was all...\n:Their profit so far:\n::$20,000,000\n:Share you deserve (be fair!):\n::[Drop-down.]\n:::25%\n:::'''30%'''\n:::35%\n:Mailing address:\n::137 Ash Tree Ln\n\n:[Cueball still at the laptop, above him is a SUBMIT button, and it shows a pointing hand cursor.]\n:CLICK\n\n:[Last panel set slightly lower than the rest.]\n:[Cueball is in front of an open box full of cash, with cash in his hand. A FedEx delivery guy is on the other side of the box with his PDA and pen.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was originally called [[827: Business Idea]], but Randall renamed it on 11:35 AM UTC to resolve a conflict on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com]. The conflict was created when he released the comic [[1721: Business Idea]] around five years after this comic's release, as both comics shared the same name and filename. This is the third time Randall has released a comic with a [[:Category:Comics sharing name|name exactly the same]] as a previous comic.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]<!--see trivia-->"
