Especially since each one will have leftovers!'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic shows the plight of [[Randall]] who occasionally motivates himself to cook. After buying ingredients and cooking them, the food always ended up either tasted \"kinda good\" or not good, therefore - although he puts the leftovers in the fridge - hours later he orders pizza instead of eating the leftovers.\n\nA few days later he first throws away the leftovers, and some weeks later also the unused ingredients. After some months he is motivated again to cook more and the loop repeats. This discontinued effort may be part of the reason his cooking does not improve much over time.\n\nThe title text describes that buying ingredients for a single meal might be more expensive than eating at a restaurant, but it would be compensated if there are enough leftovers to eat again from it or cook several meals. Of course, this idea is vitiated if he gives up cooking after a single try and throws away all remaining food.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A flowchart.]\n\n:I should cook more! --> Buy ingredients --> Put some in a pan --> Cook --> Does it taste good? --> (arrows marked \"Kinda\" and \"No\" both lead to) Put leftovers in fridge --> (hours pass) --> Order pizza --> (days pass) --> Throw away leftovers --> (weeks pass) --> Throw away remaining ingredients as they go bad --> (months pass) --> (arrow leads back to beginning)\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Flowcharts]]"
