Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThis comic shows a message in a bottle on the beach, much like [[1675: Message in a Bottle]].\n\n{{w|ICMP}} is a protocol that's used among other things for \"pings\" that are used to see if one machine can successfully communicate with another machine. When you send a ping, your computer sends an \"Echo request\" packet; the receiver sends an \"Echo response\" message back to the sender (the term \"echo\" refers to the fact that the data in the request is copied to the response). [[Cueball]] is emulating this same process with the messages in the bottle. However, one difference is that bottles cast into the sea don't have a fixed destination, so there's no assurance (or even expectation) that the response will reach the original sender.\n\nThe title text references {{w|ICMPv6}}, which is the version of ICMP used with {{w|IPv6}}. Adoption of IPv6 in general has been slow, and the joke in the comic is that shipwrecked sailors using messages in a bottle to try to communicate with the outside world have not adopted this messaging protocol for their pings.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[Cueball is walking on a sandy beach near the shore. A bottle is stuck in the sand, presumably from being washed up by the tide.]\n\n:[Cueball has picked up the bottle and is reading the message inside. There is illegible text written beneath the title of the message.]\n:Message: ICMP Echo Request\n\n:[Cueball has set the bottle down below him and is now scribbling out a new message. Once again, there is illegible text written beneath the title of the message.]\n:Message: ICMP Echo Reply\n\n:[Cueball is walking away from the shore now, having set the bottle back into the sea.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
