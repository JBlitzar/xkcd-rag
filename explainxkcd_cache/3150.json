Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThis comic shows a {{w|message in a bottle}} on the beach, much like [[1675: Message in a Bottle]].\n\nThe {{w|Internet Control Message Protocol}} (ICMP) is a network communication protocol that's used (among other things) for \"pings\" that test whether one machine can successfully communicate with another. When you send a ping, your computer sends an \"echo request\" packet; the receiver sends an \"echo response\" message back to the sender (the term \"echo\" refers to the fact that the data in the request is copied to the response). Someone over the sea has initiated this process with a message in a bottle, and [[Cueball]] receives the echo request and responds. However, one difference from ICMP is that bottles cast into the sea don't have a fixed destination, so there's no assurance (or even expectation) that the response will reach the original sender, nor even that the request had even found the originally intended destination. In addition, ping response times are typically measured in milliseconds or at most a few seconds, but here, even in the highly unlikely event that the sea does bring the bottle back to the original sender, this round-trip transmission has an ''extremely'' long ping response time.\n\nPinging another network node is something typically done when initiating extensive communication with it, or when testing whether network communication is working. The humor here is that a shipwrecked sailor trying to get rescued by casting messages in a bottle wouldn't want to do this: the chance that one message-containing bottle gets found and acted on are slim, and the chance of succeeding with multiple back-and-forth messages is exceedingly low (this is known as packet loss). Instead a stranded sailor would just say they're in need of rescue and describe how best to find them. \n\nICMP is a supporting protocol of the {{w|Internet Protocol version 4}} (IPv4). The newer {{w|Internet Protocol version 6}} (IPv6) uses {{w|ICMPv6}} instead, which the title text references. There is no (technically correct) name to describe both ICMP and ICMPv6, so the comic could not be generic and had to choose one of them. Some people are quite upset that switch from IPv4 to IPv6 has not happened despite the decades it has been available; they might complain that Randall uses the legacy protocol here. The title text makes a joke out of that possible complaint by pointing out how absurd it would be to expect an higher adoption of IPv6 by shipwrecked sailors compared to the general population.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is walking on a sandy beach near the shore. A bottle with a paper inside is stuck in the sand, presumably from being washed up by the tide.]\n\n:[Cueball has picked up the bottle and is reading the message inside, which he has taken out. The messages contents are displayed on the top portion of the panel. There is illegible text written beneath the message title. He is holding the cork of the bottle in his other hand.]\n:Message Title: ICMP Echo Request\n\n:[Cueball has set the bottle down below him and is now scribbling out a new message. Once again, the contents are on the top portion of the panel, with illegible text written beneath the message title. He has put down the cork.]\n:Message Title: ICMP Echo Reply\n\n:[Cueball is walking away from the shore now, having set the bottle back into the sea, with the message inside.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
