The waitress, [[Ponytail]], tells Beret Guy there is a special on Tuesdays for \"endless wings\". Restaurants often have different daily discounts to encourage people to come in. In a normal restaurant, \"endless wings\" would presumably refer to \"all-you-can-eat\" {{w|chicken wings}}, meaning the customer can pay a flat price and eat all the chicken wings they want without having to pay any more.\n\nHowever, in this comic, instead of ordering them by telling the waitress: \"I'll have those\", Beret Guy tells her: \"i have those\", meaning that he already has literal \"endless wings\" (similar issues of things being taken literally are referenced in [[1086: Eyelash Wish Log]] and [[1528: Vodka]]), and then begins to grow wings which ultimately appear \"endless\" as they grow to a span of at least the circumference of the Earth by the last panel (and presumably continue growing). The other characters scream in horror for obvious reasons.\n\nThe title text plays on another common restaurant offer of \"bottomless drinks\", meaning unlimited free refills of drinks. However, falling into something literally bottomless (i.e. without a bottom) would result in falling forever. (However, even this is unlikely unless the diameter of the cups that the drinks are served in is large enough to fit a whole person into.) If it was literally \"bottomless\", you would start to decelerate as you pass the earth's center of mass. The air pressure and heat in a \"bottomless\" pit would also be fatal to humans.\n\nThis is one of the few [[:Category:Comics with lowercase text|comics with lowercase text]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail serves Beret Guy and somebody else at a table.]\n:Ponytail: ...and on Tuesdays we offer endless wings.\n:Beret Guy: Haha, cool.\n:Beret Guy: <small>i have those.</small>\n\n:Ponytail: You what?\n\n:[Beret Guy sprouts a pair of wings.]\n:Ponytail: ''AAAAA!!''\n\n:[Beret Guy's wings start getting longer.]\n:Ponytail and Other person beret guy is sitting with: ''AAAAAAA''\n\n:[Wings start to extend into space out from the earth.]\n:Everyone: ''AAAAAAAA''\n\n==Trivia==\n*This is one of the few comics since the ''xkcd'' lettering became inked and standardized as all-caps that lowercase lettering has been used (including the word \"i\" which would normally be capitalized). In this case, the usage may be to denote a whisper or soft voice.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
