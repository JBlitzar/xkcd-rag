It also has a lot of other percentages and dates, so take a look if you are interested.\n\n==Explanation==\n\n[[Cueball]]/[[Randall]] creates this formula which helps him wait for long stretches of time which goes increasingly faster into the past as more time goes by, which gives him the effect of looking like the time goes by quickly. Which assists in the waiting process.\n\nAs far as the actual math is concerned, the formula is an {{w|exponential function}} (i.e. the variable appears in the exponent). The effect that the function grows faster and faster as p grows, is due to T(p) being exponential. More precisely, when you repeatedly add some constant to the exponent, you will repeatedly multiply some (other) constant with the value of the function. Compare how \"slow\" a value grows by adding even high values (1, 1001, 2001, 3001, 4001, 5001…) and how fast it grows by multiplying even low values (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000…)\n\nNow, the function has to be adjusted so that, as Randall put it, \"the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well I know it.\" The most important adjustment is putting p to the power of three. That lowers the amount added to the exponent for low values (0.1³=0.001, 0.2³=0.008, i.e. only 7/1000 have been added for 10% workflow) and increases the amount for high values (0.8³=0.512, 0.9³=0.729, i.e. more than 1/5 has been added for 10% workflow). That means the recent past will pass even slower and the historic past even faster than it already does by choosing an exponential function.\nThe remaining adjustments are technical. The coefficient in front of p³ adjusts the constant by which the result will be multiplied while adding some constant to p, while it also roughly ensures that p=1 yields the lifetime of the universe. The 3 added to the product in the exponent further adjusts the actual values of the power without touching the slope (the multiplicative constant). In the parentheses, e³ is subtracted to put the time to 0 when p=0. Otherwise the function would start approx. 20 yrs and 1 month ago. For bigger p, this offset does not matter much. Imagine subtracting 20 yrs from the lifetime of the universe!\n\nFinally, the result is subtracted from the current date for aesthetical reasons. The formula could tell you \"20 years ago\", or it could read \"February 1992\". Randall decided the latter would be better. The punchline \"Swoosh!\" is about how fast the last few percents of Cueball's download happen in \"such a rush\". For most humans waiting for a download to complete tends to become really boring and progress would instead seem to get slower and slower. The workout website mentioned initially, Fitocracy, has been mentioned previously in [[940: Oversight]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! % !!

In 2008 both the American and Iraqi governments signed the {{w|U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement}}.

However the Goldmans eventally did end up with one of his assets, the rather scandalous book \"If I Did It\" (O.J. writing about HYPOTHETICALLY if he HAD killed them, how and why he'd have HYPOTHETICALLY killed them) which the Goldmans rebranded from \"a ghost story\", as O.J. put it, to \"a confession of a killer\".   \n|-\n|                                         Princess Diana died in a car crash [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/31/newsid_2510000/2510615.stm while being chased by paparazzi].\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 31.12% || rowspan=\"2\" | February 1995\n| Windows 95 Debuts   || The Windows 95 was an operating system developed by Microsoft.

This helps its elasticity and improves its strength. Charles Goodyear was the inventor of vulcanization. In the early, 1800s tires quickly turned soft and sticky after they got hot (something that happens when you drive on them for miles at a time in warm weather). Charles Goodyear heated up the rubber to add various chemicals to the tires and, to his amazment, the process worked!! The strength of tire was thus improved. The only problem was that the improvement wasn't because of the chemicals but because of the heating. He would eventally learn this after dropping the rubber in a frying pan, watching the rubber not melt (as one would expect), but harden. Soon after, in 1844, he patented the process.\n|-\n| Bicycle Invented,  || Randell's {{w|timeline}} may be {{w|Error|wrong}} here. It could be {{w|Argument|argued}} that the {{w|1|first}} \"{{w|Bicycle|bicycle}}\" {{w|Name|called}} a {{w|Dandy horse|\"dandy horse\"}}, was {{w|Invention|invented}} in {{w|1817}} by {{w|Baron}} {{w|Karl Drais|Karl von Drais}}. However the dandy horse didn't have any {{w|Bicycle pedal|pedals}}, so another argument could be made that the {{w|Treadle bicycle|first bicycle}} was {{w|Creativity|created}} in {{w|1839}} by {{w|Kirkpatrick MacMillan}}. This bicycle didn't move by {{w|Angular momentum|spinning}} the pedals, but by {{w|Treadle|pumping them up and down}} ({{w|Similarity (geometry)|similar}} to a {{w|grindstone}} or {{w|antique}} {{w|sewing machine}}). The first time a {{w|Crank (mechanism)|mechanical crank}} was used was in the early {{w|1860}}s, when {{w|Pierre Michaux}} and {{w|Pierre Lallement}} {{w|Scaling (geometry)|enlarged}} the {{w|Direction (geometry)|front}} wheel and added the crank to that, like a very large two wheeled {{w|Tricycle|tricycle}}. In {{w|1869}} {{w|Thomas McCall (inventor)|Thomas McCall}} made a rear-wheel drive bicycle. On top of all that, the word bicycle wasn't used until {{w|1868}}, until then all bicycles (or not bicycles) were called {{w|velocipede}}. Around this time the {{w|French people|French}} vélocipède, made of {{w|iron}} and {{w|wood}}, turned into the \"{{w|penny-farthing}}\" (as it was later to be known) which was made from a {{w|steel}} from and {{w|Tire|rubber tires}}. The invention of the bicycle wasn't just one invention, but many small inventions made by people all around a {{w|continent}}. \n|- \n| Wrench Patented    || The {{w|wrench}} was patented.

The Sibylline books were a series of nine prophesy books written by an old woman (it has never been found out who, but most likely a {{w|Cumaean Sibyl}}. It is said that they were offered to the last Emperor of Rome, {{w|Lucius Tarquinius Superbus}}, who refused to buy them twice, which resulted in three books getting burned for each denial. She then offered them back to the emperor for the same price and, at last, the Emperor bought them. The Roman Senate took control of the books and was extremely protective of them. The books were initially put under the care of two guardians, increasing to ten, then to fifteen. However, after eight centuries, a Roman General called {{w|Stilicho}} ordered them to be burned as they were being used to attack the government.\n|-\n| 70% || 22,000 Years Ago\n| ''Not given in comic'' || ''Homo Sapiens'' crosses a newly-formed land bridge between present-day Russia and Alaska, entering the Americas for the first time.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 70.33% || rowspan=\"3\" | 24,000 Years Ago\n| Caves Painted,        || This is around the time some cave paintings are from.\n|-\n| Ceramic Art Made.     || This is around the time the oldest known ceramics are from.

The extinction was primarily caused not by the impactor itself, but by the large worldwide tsunamis and the large amount of dust, which obscured the atmosphere and caused a large amount of vegetation to die off, leading to the deaths of herbivores, which then lead to the deaths of the carnivores. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 100% || rowspan=\"2\" | 13.76 billion years ago\n| Universe begins.    || The Big Bang occurred at this time (about).\n|-\n| First stars ignite. || The first stars were born in this era.\n|}\n\nNote that as of the time that this page was last cached, the comic was uploaded at {{#expr:100*(((ln(({{#time:U}}-1329195600)/31536000+e^3)-3)/20.3444)^.5)}}% progress.\n\n==Transcript==\n:When I have a boring task to get through — a three-hour lecture, a giant file download, or a long term point goal in fitocracy — I use this formula to convert the percentage completed (p) into a date:\n\n:T=(Current Date) - (e^(20.3444*p^3+3) - e^3) years\n\n:When the task is 0% done, it gives today's date, and as I make progress, I move further and further back in time\n\n:(inverse given in lighter colors)\n:Inverse: p = sqrt((ln(T+e^3)-3)/20.3444)\n\n:[Line Graph explaining the correlation between completion percentages and temporal deltas.]\n:0% = now (Date of comic is 2012-02-14T00:00-0500, approx. 1329195600 UNIX)\n:10% = September 2011\n:20% = 2008\n:30% = 1997\n:40% = 1958\n:50% = 1776\n:60% = 405 AD\n:70% = 22,000 years ago\n:80% = 671,000 years ago\n:90% = 55 million years ago\n:100% = 13.8 billion years ago\n\n:It moves slowly through the first few years, then steadily accelerates.

The inverse function in grey writing off at the bottom right of the main formula involves a square root, while the actual inverse of Randall's main function would involve a cube root. In addition, this function does not contain the current date, meaning that T, in the inverse, refers to how long ago a point in time was, rather than the point in time itself. When the T in the inverse is 20, it means that the date referenced by T is 20 years ago.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Timelines]]\n[[Category:Math]]"
