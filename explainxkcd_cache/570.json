It turns out it was bought as a prize supposed to be delivered to the 100,000,000th visitor to his company's website. But the user did not react to the notice on the page about the award, ''' even though it was flashing'''.\n\nA well-known type of Internet scam tries to trick the reader into thinking that they've won a prize, often in the form of an annoying flashy ad banner (e.g. <script>alert(\"YOU'RE THE 100,000,000th CUSTOMER! YOU WON A FREE FERRARI!\");</script>). A typical {{w|clickbait}}.\n\nCueball did have a fancy car to give out, but the winner didn't claim it, believing it to be a scam. It is a bit like {{w|The Boy Who Cried Wolf|the boy who cried wolf}} â€” given enough lies, the truth will eventually look like a lie.\n\n(As coincidences would have it, the same joke appears in the much-loved British comedy series ''{{w|That Mitchell and Webb Look}}'', in a 2006 John Finnemore sketch about a \"MASSIVE YACHT!\" giveaway. Presumably, Randall hadn't come across the ''Mitchell and Webb'' version when he wrote this comic three years later.)\n\nThe title text refers to another type of scam: advertising fake \"{{w|Penis enlargement|male enhancement}}\" drugs. [[Randall]] suggests that if such a drug did exist, it would be complicated to advertise effectively, since most people would assume it was a scam. Additionally, there may be a relation implied (intersection) between people having sports cars and people needing penis enlargements: big cars to compensate for feelings of inferiority{{Citation needed}} (or [[1615: Red Car|red cars to pay for cyanness]]).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Cueball-like guy is standing behind, a sports car where Cueball sits turned toward him.]\n:Friend: When'd you get the car?\n\n:[Zoom-in on Cueball in the car.]\n:Cueball: It's the darndest thing. We bought it as a prize for the 100,000,000<sup>th</sup> visitor to our website.\n\n:[Zoom-in on the friend.]\n:Friend: And they didn't want it?\n:Cueball (off-screen): Apparently.\n\n:[Pan to where both the friend and Cueball in the car can be seen, but not the front of the car.]\n:Friend: Maybe they didn't see the notice.\n:Cueball: It was flashing and everything!\n:Friend: How bizarre.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
