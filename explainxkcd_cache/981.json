How could you enjoy abusing a filesystem like that?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] seems to have found a porn folder. However, it contains a directory loop, set up by a person off-screen. It is possible to actually do this, but it is widely regarded as a very bad idea, as it can break the system in not-so-obvious ways (mostly by causing seemingly-trivial operations to infinite loop). The implication is that the folder does not need to contain pornographic images because the folder ''is'' the pornâ€”its violation of the taboo against looping is something the off-screen character finds erotic.\n\n<code>link()</code> is the Linux system call to create a hard link. In an unmodified Linux kernel, it will not allow directory hard links for this exact reason; the person who set up the porn folder apparently \"forced\" Linux to comply, with all of the sexual analogies that suggests.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a desk, looking at a laptop screen with one hand on his chin.]\n:Cueball: So I thought I found your porn folder, in calendar/backup/PORN/\n:Friend (off screen): Don't open that!\n\n:[A wider shot of the person looking at the laptop.]\n:Cueball: But it contains a bunch more folders, filled with more folders, and then... after 20 levels, somehow I'm back at the main folder?\n:Friend (off screen): It's, uh, well hidden.\n\n:[Cueball has turned around in the chair, now with the laptop in his lap.]\n:Cueball: I think there's no actual porn here.\n:Cueball: You're just turned on by filesystems.\n:Friend (off screen): It's a hardlinked directory loop - so taboo!\n:Cueball: Now I feel dirty sharing a drive with you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Recursion]]\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
