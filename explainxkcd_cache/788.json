Since then, try as I might, I haven't ONCE been able to read it normally.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Emily Dickinson}} is a famous American poet, who wrote a poem called \"[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/stop.html Death]\", about the personification of Death kindly stopping for her to pick her up. \n\n''{{w|Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto}}'' is a well known video game series where players commonly steal cars by grabbing the driver and throwing them out of the vehicle. In the lower left corner of the second panel, there is a picture of the Y-button used to enter (and steal) vehicles in the Xbox versions of the game.\n\nThe proposed Emily Dickinson edition of ''Grand Theft Auto'' mashes up these two concepts. When Death stops to pick up the protagonist ([[Hairbun]], possibly representing Dickinson herself), she violently carriage-jacks him and takes over his carriage to use for her own purposes.\n\nThe title text refers to [http://achewood.com/index.php?date=08032010 this] strip from the webcomic ''{{w|Achewood}}'' where it is pointed out that poems written in {{w|ballad metre}} can be sung to the same tune as the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfR7qxtgCgY theme song]  of ''{{w|Gilligan's Island}}'', a 1960s sitcom. Upon learning this it can (as it seemingly has for Randall) become difficult to read Dickinson's poem without singing it.\n\nThe Western-themed ''{{w|Red Dead Redemption}}'' by the same publisher as ''Grand Theft Auto'' uses the same gameplay mechanic for stealing horses and horse carriages, but ''Grand Theft Auto'' was a more established franchise at the time of the comic's release.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Death with his scythe is driving a horse-drawn carriage. The text is written in two frames above and below the carriage:]\n:Because I could not stop for death\n:He kindly stopped for me\n\n:[Hairbun grabs Death by the arm and pulls him off the carriage. There is a circle with the letter Y in the lower left corner. The text above the carriage is in a frame.]\n:The carriage held but just oursel-\n:Death: Hey!\n:Hands holding Death: ''Grab''\n:Circle: Y\n\n:[Hairbun takes off in the carriage with the scythe, leaving Death behind on the ground in the dust from the carriage taking off.]\n:Hairbun: Hyah!\n\n:[Hairbun stands with her arms crossed, and Death's scythe next to her. The first text above her is printed as the official logo and the text below is in a type of square brackets.]\n:Grand Theft Auto \n:Emily Dickinson Edition\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
