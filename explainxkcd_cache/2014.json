The telescope has been in development since 1996, but has been plagued by numerous delays and cost overruns. This comic was likely inspired by the most recent [https://nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-completes-webb-telescope-review-commits-to-launch-in-early-2021 delay announcement], which was posted on June 27, 2018. At that time, the JWST was scheduled to launch on March 30, 2021.\n\n* In July 2020, this was pushed back further to October 31, 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n* In June 2021, it was announced that the launch day will likely slip to at least mid-November 2021.\n* On September 8, 2021, ESA announced that the official planned launch date is [https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Targeted_launch_date_for_Webb_18_December_2021 December 18, 2021.]\n* On November 22, 2021, NASA announced that the official planned launch date was delayed by four days to December 22, 2021, following a problem encountered when mating JWST to its payload adapter. This date was referenced in [[2550: Webb]].\n* On December 15, 2021, NASA announced that the official planned launch date was delayed by two days to December 24, 2021, following a [https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-december-24 communications issue between JWST and the launch vehicle]\n* On December 21, 2021, NASA announced that the official planned launch date was delayed by one day to December 25, 2021 due to [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-update adverse weather at the launch site]\n* On December 25, 2021, the telescope was successfully launched, which Randall anticipated with this comic: [[2559: December 25th Launch]].\n\nThis comic portrays the launch delays and the new predicted launch years and the times at which those predictions were made.  There have been so many delays in this project that you can plot a line of best fit with a surprisingly high degree of accuracy.  Randall says optimistically that the line’s slope is less than one (there is less than one year of ''new'' delay per year of elapsed time), implying, of course, that if events continue without further intervention, it will eventually be built, with a predicted launch date of late 2026.\n\nThe title text alludes to the famous research over the {{w|Accelerating expansion of the universe|universe’s accelerating expansion}}.  The expansion had been predicted to be slowing due to gravity from everything in the universe; instead, it was found to be accelerating since about 5 billion years ago.  Here, Randall looks at the apparently ever-delaying schedule and observes that the delay per time does not decrease, although the date gets nearer (which should help to schedule the launch date, as research and unknown parameters are replaced with engineering and exact predictions and measurements). However, this delay inflation contradicts Randall's usage of a linear trendline.  Given the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}} brought some additional delays in 2020 and 2021, the \"early 2020\" date was perhaps unintentionally prescient.\n\nThe Wikipedia article linked above includes a {{w|James Webb Space Telescope#Cost and schedule issues|table}} which provides the data points for the chart:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! width=35 | Year !!
