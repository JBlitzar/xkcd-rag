Some subcultures form based on a geeky obsession over a trivial topic ([[Main Page|for instance, a minimally-drawn webcomic]]). In this case, that topic is crazy straws, which are toy drinking straws designed with unusual twists and loops.  This strip uses this group as an example of the fractal nature of cultures.\n\nInformally speaking, a {{w|fractal}} is a mathematical shape with an infinite level of detail. Just as fractals can always be divided into smaller patterns, Randall points out that human subcultures can always be divided into smaller subcultures. We have the \"people who like crazy straws\" subculture, but this is further divided into the professionals and the hobbyists. The hobbyists are themselves broken into those who accept loops in the straws and those who don't. A splinter group, as used in the comic, is a subculture that breaks off from a larger one. Of course, this nesting is not really infinite, since there is a finite number of people living.{{cn}} The claim that it is infinite is hyperbole.\n\nDespite the incredible amount of work fans put into it, the whole concept seems completely inconsequential to an outsider. This irony is the source of humor in this strip. [[915: Connoisseur| An earlier comic]] covers a similar topic.\n\n{{w|Paris Hilton}} is a celebrity who is essentially famous for being famous. The \"guy named Eric\" mentioned in the title-text is someone prominent in the amateur plastic crazy-straw community, but that doesn't really count as famous by most standards, so the Paris Hilton comparison is quite a stretch.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two people hang out with some beverages. Cueball here has a bright green crazy straw.]\n:Cueball: The thing to understand about the plastic crazy straw design world is that there are two main camps: The ''professionals'' - designing for established brands - and the ''hobbyists''.\n:Cueball: The hobbyist mailing lists are full of drama, with friction between the regulars and a splinter group focused on loops...\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Human subcultures are nested fractally. There's no bottom.\n\n==Trivia==\nWhen this comic was first released, Randall typed \"subcultres\" instead of \"subcultures\". The typo has since been fixed, but the original image is available [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/3/3e/20120819222628%21crazy_straws.png here].\n\n{{Comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
