(P.S. benzoyl peroxide soap works great.)\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] suffers from {{w|acne}}. Like many others afflicted with the same condition, he uses skin care products designed to treat acne. Unlike most other people, he does his own controlled trial by using them on only one half of his face and measuring the effects; the blemishes on the treated half of his face are noticeably diminished, while the untreated half remains the same, allowing him to isolate the effects of the cream versus the effects of time.\n\nHe convinces his friends to try the same experiment with different treatments so they can find out which works the best. In order to properly randomize the trials, he flips a coin. However, because half of his face is \"scarred\" (with acne blemishes), he's flipping a coin, and appears to be threatening someone with acid, he's mistaken for the Batman villain {{w|Two-Face}}. (Two-Face flips a coin to decide whether his victims will live or die, and was badly burned by acid on exactly one half of his face.) Cueball is subsequently punched by Batman; {{tvtropes|NoodleIncident|the title-text implies that this has happened before}}.\n\n{{w|Salicylic acid}} and {{w|benzoyl peroxide}} are both chemicals known for their skin care effects (salicylic acid in particular is also used to treat {{w|psoriasis}}).\n\n==Trivia==\nThe version of Batman depicted appears to be Christian Bale's character from the Dark Knight trilogy thanks to the wrist blades and unique cowl shape. Two-Face appeared in the second film, which was released two years prior to this comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:I get frustrated trying to judge whether acne creams are having any effect. In the spirit of a controlled trial, I used one on just half my face for a few weeks.\n:[A graph shows pimples vs. time, with two lines: one remains steady, and one is declining.]\n\n:It was cool seeing the effects so clearly, so I got some friends to try different treatments in an impromptu study.\n:[Cueball looks in a mirror, sees a half-pimpled face, and applies a treatment.]\n\n:[Cueball is talking to Ponytail and Megan, each with some pimples also.]\n:Cueball: Okay, you try the salicylic acid first.\n:Ponytail: Wait, we should randomize the trials. Got a coin?\n\n:Cueball: Okay, call it. Heads, she gets the-\n:(Off-panel): YOU!\n\n:[Batman runs into frame and punches Cueball. The coin goes flying.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]"
