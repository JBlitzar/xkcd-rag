Each unique intersection contains a short list of nouns that can be preceded by each of its intersecting adjectives.\n\nFor example, \"flying fox\" (a type of bat) appears at the intersection of \"large\", \"small\", and \"great\", because the species {{w|large flying fox}}, {{w|small flying fox}}, and {{w|great flying fox}} all exist, but there is no such species as a \"big flying fox\" or a \"little flying fox\". Similarly, humans have organs named the {{w|small intestine}} and {{w|large intestine}}, but no \"little intestine\", \"great intestine\", or \"big intestine\".\n\nSome descriptors are applied in combination to their noun, rather than individually; for example, \"planet\" is placed in both the \"little\" and \"big\" groups in reference to the 2008 video game ''{{w|Little Big Planet}}''.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] declares that he will start intentionally using term combinations that don't appear in the above diagram, presumably to ensure every intersection contains at least one term. A slightly more reasonable solution is to publish books/songs/films/''etc'' under these titles (details needed), as many of the entries in this comic are titles.\n\nA similar concept can be seen in [[181: Interblag]], but in a tabular form rather than a Venn diagram.\n\n===List of items in the diagram===\nThe following table lists all size/noun combinations that the Venn diagram can generate, with a description of each.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Item\n!Big !!
