In Europe, the {{w|Calendar date#Gregorian, day–month–year (DMY)|usual order}} is ''day/month/year'' — so 2/3/22 is (the) 2<sup>nd</sup> (of) March, 2022.\n\n\"{{w|Internationalization and localization|Localization}}\" (also known as L10N) is the technique used in software to make it accept input and display output in the formats most natural to users in their locations. For example, in the United States numbers use commas \",\" to separate thousands and a {{w|Decimal separator#Countries using decimal point|decimal point}} \".\" to separate the decimal values, while in large areas of the EU {{w|Decimal separator#Countries using decimal comma|it is the reverse}}.  And the textual output will be translated to the local language. Naturally, this also includes displaying dates in the local format, as described above. Localization may also include the adoption of the tax law to the location, for instance when adopting tax software made for the US to the UK. \n\nThe joke in this {{w|Comics|comic}} is that two dates are shown, on the same {{w|Display device|display}}, relating to meetings regarding localization. The date of the meeting of the US team is localized in the US format while the EU team's meeting is localized in the European format, and these two dates (about a month apart) happen to be formatted the same. [[Cueball]] needs to explain that the European meeting will be a month later than the US meeting to avoid any confusion due to the ambiguity. Which is {{w|Irony|ironic}}, since the aim of localization is to reduce such {{w|Confusion|confusion}}.\n\nA further interpretation, which extends also into the title text, is that these groups may have been supposed to meet on the same day. But even the committee that was supposed to fix these problems messed this up. Cueball may be 'explaining' the staggered approach to cover up that the two groups are already reading the date(s) for the meeting quite differently.\n\n{{w|ISO-8601}} specifies a date format of YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2021-12-31), which results in dates being listed in chronological order when sorted stringwise. The ISO format is called \"{{w|big-endian}}\", which refers to the fact that the most significant unit in the date (the year) comes first. The European format is instead \"{{w|little-endian}}\", as the front-end value represents the finest possible distinction the date can convey — the particular day. The American format is \"{{w|middle-endian}}\", or occasionally \"mixed-endian\", since the value given first is the one which is neither the one with greatest significance nor the most precise.\n\nThe joke in the title text is that it appears some people attempted to interpret the improperly formatted date as if it were expressed in the more ISO-8601 style of format of \"Y/M/D\". They read the date as ''200''2, March 22<sup>nd</sup>, so they already went to their meeting almost 20 years ago.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A screen is shown which displays five rows of text, the top three above a dividing line. To the right of the screen the upper part of Cueball is visible as he delivers a message concerning the text on the screen:] \n:Localization working group\n:Upcoming meetings\n:-----------------\n:US Team: 2/3/22\n:EU Team: 2/3/22\n\n:Cueball: And the European formatting and localization team will meet a month later...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Calendar]]"
