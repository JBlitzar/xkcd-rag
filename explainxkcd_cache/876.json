The brain has no means of verifying that the information received from the senses indeed corresponds to the actual outside world; for example, all of these sensations could be hallucinations.\n\nThe 911 operator ([[Ponytail]]) references {{w|Allegory of the Cave|Plato's cave}}. This is a reference to an allegory by {{w|Plato}} in which he describes a scenario where prisoners are chained against a wall and can only see shadows moving on the opposite wall of the cave. These shadows would make up \"reality\" for the prisoners, who have no conception of a world outside the cave (or, for that matter, the objects inside the cave that are casting the shadows, which are out of view). They would create words for the things they were seeing, but that would only correspond to the shadows and not the physical things themselves casting the shadows. Plato's cave is commonly used as an analogy for the philosophical dilemma expressed by Cueball's brain in this comic. Ponytail mentions that she “can’t send a search-and-rescue team into Plato’s cave,” referencing it as if it were an physical location.\n\nThe title text is also about Plato's cave and treats it like an actual cave with prisoners; [[Randall]] is saying that {{w|Socrates}}, Plato's teacher, should have just gone into the cave and brought the prisoners out instead of dealing with the extended allegory. The {{w|tranquilizer gun}} is for the prisoners, so they don't completely freak out while being taken out of the cave.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is on a corded wall phone.]\n:Cueball: Hello? 911? I'm trapped!\n:Cueball: It's dark and I can't see anything except these two distorted splotches of light!\n:Cueball: Help!\n\n:[Ponytail, a 911 operator is in an office, wearing a headset.]\n:Ponytail: Splotches of light? Your... eyeballs?\n:Cueball (over phone): I think that's what they are! There's meat everywhere!\n\n:[Focus on Ponytail's head.]\n:Ponytail: ...so you're a brain.\n:Cueball (over phone): Yes!\n:Ponytail: Yeah, we all are. You're not trapped. Use your body to walk around and experience reality.\n\n:Cueball: But everything's just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be sure they correspond to an external world?!\n:Ponytail (over phone): I'm sorry, but we can't send a search-and-rescue team into Plato's cave.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]"
