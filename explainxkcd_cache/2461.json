These toys are little rubber hemispheres, about 1\" (25 mm) in diameter and 1/8\" (3 mm) thick. When turned inside-out and placed on a hard surface, they will, after a short wait, snap back to their original shape, popping up into the air. The joke is that kids who grew up with these toys will think they're a great idea to propel a space ship to orbit, when in fact the toys launch at mere tens of kilometers per hour, far short of the thousands needed to reach {{w|orbital speed}}{{citation needed}}. But now kids playing with these are those that make rockets, hence the title 90's Kid Space Program (KSP). Even if the popper-based propulsion system could generate enough acceleration to reach orbit, the abrupt impulse would likely cause serious harm to any astronauts.\n\nThe title text implies that many working now at {{w|NASA}} were 90s kids. Both categories would include [[Randall]], as he was born in 1984 and previously worked at NASA. The title is a reference to the {{w|Kerbal Space Program}} (KSP) which has been a [[:Category:Kerbal Space Program|recurring theme]] on xkcd, and it has previously been hinted at that NASA's employees uses this program in [[1244: Six Words]] and [[2204: Ksp 2]]. And also that you learn more about orbital Mechanics by using KSP than from being hired by NASA in [[1356: Orbital Mechanics]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A command and service module representing the tip of a spacecraft, is attached by four long trusses to four equidistant points on the edge of a giant light green popper (a green \"hill\" with a round raised edge around it).  The popper is in its inverted configuration, ready to pop. There is a caption beneath the panel:]\n:The 90's Kid Space Program prepares for their first orbital launch\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Kerbal Space Program]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]"
