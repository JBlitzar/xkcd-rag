Far from being responsible for any massacre, he protected his subjects from external dominance and is still a national hero to the Czech people. [[Black Hat]] is supplying {{w|disinformation}} to unsuspecting carolers, either to shut them up, by making them falsely think that they are associating themselves with a morally reprehensible man, or just because he's a [[classhole]] like that.\n\nThe title text references \"the {{w|St. Stephen's Day|Feast of Stephen}}\", also known as the \"Feast of St. Stephen\" or \"St. Stephen's Day\", which is a holiday celebrated on 26 or 27 December by the {{w|Latin Church|Western}} or {{w|Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church}} respectively.  (For the {{w|Eastern Orthodox Church}}, which still observes the {{w|Julian calendar}}, it falls on 9 January of the {{w|Gregorian calendar}}.) It is not actually a feast that involved eating a person named Stephen.{{Citation needed}}\nIf you look closely, you can see that the carolers may be a family. The man and woman are confused by what Black Hat has said, and the girl is looking to the adults, perhaps gauging their facial reactions, or just waiting for their reply.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three people, two the same size, one smaller stand together singing Christmas carols.]\n:Carolers (in unison): Good king Wenceslas looked out on theâ€” \n\n:[Black Hat leans out of an above ground window.]\n:Black Hat: King Wenceslas massacred my people.\n\n:[The carolers stand in silence, the smaller one looks at the others.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Christmas]]"
