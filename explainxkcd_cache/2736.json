Serifs are ticks, or end-bars, at the ends of lines that make up letters. Rather than mere lines, there are (for example) \"feet\" put at the bottom of a letter such as <span style=\"font-family: Serif;\">A</span>, and possibly also at angles such as its peak. Fonts that use this visual decoration are called \"Serif\" fonts, while others do not and are thus \"Sans Serif\" fonts (\"sans\" being French for \"without\"). [[Randall]] is suggesting a font using ''only'' these accent pieces and skipping the \"body\" of the letters entirely. Of course, this renders the text basically unreadable.\n\nIn the comic, the text as a whole appears to be \"<span style=\"font-family: Serif;\">Aa Bb Cc Dd</span>\", perhaps written in variant #3 or variant #540 of {{w|Caslon}}.\n\nAs for the title text, {{w|Times New Roman}} is a widely available and recognized typeface with serifs, being one of the most commonly used fonts of its type. {{w|Comic Sans}} is a ''mostly'' sans-serif typeface (hence the “Sans” in the name) inspired by comic book lettering. Many graphic designers {{w|Comic_Sans#Opposition|dislike Comic Sans}} due to a history of amateurs using it in contexts where its informal style is inappropriate. Defenders claim that it is easier for dyslexics to read (although this is disputed), and that it works well in less formal, typically children's contexts. Randall is suggesting here that if you want to severely anger a bunch of graphic designers (i.e. enough to beat you up), then you should try removing the characteristic and aesthetic serifs on Times New Roman and add them instead to the hated Comic Sans – which would probably make it look even worse to a graphic designer.\n\n[[:User:NiceGuy1|One of the users of explain xkcd]] took the chance anyway of getting that beating and here is what it looks like normally and what it might look like after moving the serifs: <br>\n[[File:2736MovedSerifsV2.jpg]] \n\nRandall has had numerous careers and [[:Category:My Hobby|hobbies]] where he has delighted in exploring novel methods of resolving disputes, all of which has satisfied nobody and led to him being banned from numerous [[:Category:Banned from conferences|events]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A very thin comic panel with three light gray horizontal lines drawn as on ruled paper used for handwriting.  Superimposed on these ruling lines are 15 black markings, either in the form of lines, horizontal or vertical, and in other cases merely dots, and some markings are in between, like a dot with a small line. These marks line up with either the top, middle or bottom ruling lines, with only two dots near the middle line. There seem to be no order in how these markings are placed. There is a caption beneath the panel:]\n:Instead of serif or sans-serif, my new font is '''''only''''' serifs.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Graphic designers]]"
