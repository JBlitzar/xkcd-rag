Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\nFixing things that are malfunctioning can be difficult, take a long time, be annoying, or simply impossible without help. This comic is about people who not only go through the process of fixing things by themselves, but also afterwards create and share instructions on the internet to help others who are going through the same problems. This means that subsequent people with the problem do not have to spend nearly as much time trying to fix the problem, at the expense of the original solver's time to make and publish the video, which is why the people who make such videos should be celebrated. This comic suggests that these heroes should receive at least a statue. This adds an extra layer of humor to the comic, as something so mundane would not be deserving of a statue.{{cn}}\n\nThanks to these people, [[Cueball]] is able to find the solution to his problem easily, unlike in [[979: Wisdom of the Ancients]]. This comic could be seen as a happier version of the events in that earlier comic, though this one concerns an appliance and the other seems to be software.\n\nThe title text implies that the sculptor who is making the statues will have broken sculpting tools and will need to watch an instructional video on how to repair their tools. Therefore the person who made the most helpful video for repairing these tools should be the person whose likeness the statues are modelled after. But if they change the model midway, they would need to make another statue, which might result in a long series of statues.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n:[Cueball sits at his desk, on which there is a laptop computer showing a video. His hands are on his lap. Behind Cueball's chair and on the floor, there is a humidifier with \"E-21\" printed on it, making noise. The humidifier's cord extends to the right side of the panel.]\n:Voice from computer: Hey all!\n:Voice from computer: Does your E-21 humidifier make an annoying clicking noise? Mine did, but I finally figured out that there's an easy fix, so I made this video in case anyone else...\t\n:Cueball: Oh my god. Yes. '''''Yes.'''''\n:Humidifier: Click click\n \n:[Caption below the panel:]\t\n:I know there's more important work in the world, but I feel like these people deserve, at minimum, a statue.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
