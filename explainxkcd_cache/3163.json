The caption states that people who go to the effort of helping people, by creating such videos, should at least be rewarded by a statue. While Cueball's problem may be very annoying to him, it is distinctly trivial, and people are not normally given public accolades for solving such minor issues.\n\nIt is initially unclear whether this is one statue for each individual helper, or not, but the title text implies that a single model/muse is used, perhaps to symbolically represent gratefulness for the totality of ''all'' such helpful people in a single monumental creation of appreciation. Alternatively, one original statue might be duplicated as necessary to allow each helper to have their own personal copy.\n\nThe choice of muse arises from the assumption that the sculptor who is making the statue will at some point experience the problem of having broken sculpting tools (though this depends upon the interpretation of their use in 'installation'), and so need to watch an instructional video on how to repair them and start/continue the commission. Therefore, as a representative helpful figure, the person who made the video consulted by the sculptor should be the one studied as the archetype for the final form.\n\nThis requires that the sculptee be positively identified prior to the point at which sculptor gets too far into the sculpting process. Simplicity then suggests that the nascent commemorative process starts off by the hiring of a candidate craftsman who is ''currently'' inactive due to being beset by broken (but, under guidance, fixable) implements, and proceeding in whatever manner then leads towards the final goal.\n\nThanks to this video, Cueball finds the solution to his problem easily, unlike in [[979: Wisdom of the Ancients]]. This comic could be seen as a happier version of the events in that earlier comic, though this one concerns an appliance and the other concerns software.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n:[Cueball sits at his desk, on which there is a laptop computer showing a video. His hands are on his lap. Behind Cueball's chair and on the floor, there is a humidifier with \"E-21\" printed on it, making noise. The humidifier's cord extends to the right side of the panel.]\n:Voice from computer: Hey all!\n:Voice from computer: Does your E-21 humidifier make an annoying clicking noise? Mine did, but I finally figured out that there's an easy fix, so I made this video in case anyone else...\t\n:Cueball: Oh my god. Yes. '''''Yes.'''''\n:Humidifier: Click click\n \n:[Caption below the panel:]\t\n:I know there's more important work in the world, but I feel like these people deserve, at minimum, a statue.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
