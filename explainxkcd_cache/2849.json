Megan points out that we're always under the stars, they're just obscured (\"painted over\") during the day by the brightness of the Sun and its interaction with the sky. Of course, this makes the 'under the stars' part of the remark redundant in the first place, because by this definition, sitting outside is always under the stars. Also, since the Sun is itself a star, regardless of whether or not the other stars are visible when it's daytime, you would always be under at least ''one'' visible star. In fact, sitting inside is arguably under the stars as well, since the stars are still there, just obscured by a roof or other construction. Poetically, though, it could be taken to mean that Megan simply loves to sit and ponder the very existence, vastness, numerousness, etc. of the stars, even when she can't see them.\n\n[[File:parallel V404 Cygni.png|300px|thumb|If you live on the blue line, the black hole in V404 Cygni is directly over you once a day. Zoomable version [https://rpubs.com/perelopez/Parallel_33_52_02_N here].]]\nThis is related to the concept of {{w|object permanence}}, which is the understanding that objects continue to exist even though we can't physically sense them. When you close your eyes, the universe doesn't go away even though you can't see it; similarly, when the Sun is shining, the stars are still all there.\n\nIn the early days of xkcd, it was common for Randall to publish a comic that was not intentionally funny — often also featuring Cueball and Megan — so this is a bit of a return to form.\n\nThe title text mentions {{w|V404 Cygni}}, a binary system composed of a 9-solar-mass black hole and a star smaller than the Sun. With a {{w|declination}} of +33° 52′ 02.0″, once every 23 hours and 56 minutes (366.24 times per year, compared to 365.24 solar days within the same timeframe), it 'passes over' any point of the rotating Earth with that latitude north, like Los Angeles, Atlanta or Beirut.\n\nThe night sky being \"terrifying\" is probably related to a quote from {{w|Blaise Pascal}}:\n\n: “I see the terrifying spaces of the universe that enclose me, and I find myself attached to a corner of this vast expanse, without knowing why I am more in this place than in another, nor why this little time that is given me to live is assigned me at this point more than another out of all the eternity that has preceded me and out of all that will follow me.” [https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/339964-i-see-the-terrifying-spaces-of-the-universe-that-enclose]\n\nThis may also be a subtle reference to the short story {{w|Nightfall (Asimov novelette and novel)|Nightfall}} by {{w|Isaac Asimov}} and the related novel (also with {{w|Robert Silverberg}}). This story takes place on a planet that has so many suns that they never have darkness and can never see the stars.  In that story an eclipse occurs every 2049 years which causes a complete psychological breakdown of everyone on the planet, as they all fear the dark and have no concept of the vastness of space nor of the existence of other stars. In this comic, the reference to a sky full of stars being \"terrifying\" is reminiscent of that short story and novel.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Megan and Cueball are sitting in a field of green grass while looking at the clear blue sky, the grass beneath them slightly moving throughout the comic.]\n\n:Megan: I love sitting out under the stars.\n\n:[Megan and Cueball look at eachother while sitting on the field.]\n\n:Cueball: ...It's daytime.\n:Megan: Yeah, but the stars are all still up there.\n\n:[Megan and Cueball look back at the sky, the sun enters the panel from the right, moving left.]\n\n:Megan: Constellations wheel overhead; they're just painted over with blue.\n:Megan: Every sky is full of stars.\n\n:[Megan and Cueball are still looking at the sky, the sun exits the panel through the left.]\n\n:Cueball: That's somehow terrifying.\n:Megan: It's okay—just look at that sunny sky and tell yourself space isn't real.\n:Megan: \"Daytime\" is us closing our eyes and pretending it makes infinity go away.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The sun and grass are continuously drawn between frames, as if the frames are organized spatially instead of temporally.\n* The idea of considering what celestial objects are directly above a given location has been visited before in the [http://what-if.xkcd.com/161/ Star Ownership] What if?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Time]]"
