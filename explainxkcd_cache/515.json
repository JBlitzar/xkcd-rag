In the first panel, they are affectionate toward each other — holding hands and using terms of endearment ({{w|danish pastry}} and {{w|pie}}). This behavior is common with couples but unexpected coming from these normally cynical characters. (However, [[433: Journal 5]] confirms that they are dating—so the surprise here is their unusually affectionate language rather than their relationship.) The entrance of [[Cueball]] and his subsequent discovery of them in this state prompts Black Hat and Danish to kill him. Their return to their more typical behavior contrasts with the first panel, presumably motivated by a desire to either dissimulate the warmer aspects of their personalities or their relationship altogether. \n\nThe title text provides the alternative hypothesis that they were planning on killing him the whole time and were intentionally acting affectionate for the mental effect it would have on their victim.\n\n[[542: Cover-Up]] provides a possible continuation of this story.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Danish are talking and holding hands.]\n:Black Hat: You're my dearest darling danish.\n:Danish: And you're my lovely cutie pie.\n:Black Hat: Well, you're-\n:[Cueball enters.]\n:[Black Hat and Danish look at each other and let go of each other's hands.]\n:[Black Hat holds a bloody sack, while Danish pushes down on a shovel to make a hole for what is presumably Cueball's body.]\n\n==Trivia==\n*This comic inspired the use of \"Danish\" to refer to [[Black Hat]]'s girlfriend on this wiki.\n**It is obviously not her real name, as it was just a cake-related term of endearment. But at least one person thinks it is better than the name used before this comic.\n*This comic may be a continuation of the journal series, and may be followed by [[542: Cover-Up]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Danish]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with blood]]"
