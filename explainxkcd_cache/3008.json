Proterozoic rocks which were formed from sediment at the bottom of an inland sea such as the former {{w|Western Interior Seaway}} would be in North America today.\n\nThe first animal eyes are believed to have [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1716824114 developed on trilobites] half a billion years ago, around the transition between the proterozoic and {{w|phanerozoic eon}}s at the start of the {{w|Cambrian}} period. This transition began a great proliferation of biological diversity known as the {{w|Cambrian explosion}}.\n\nCueball talks about feeling a connection to the rock, which spans \"a vast abyss of time that stretches back as far as the eye can see.\" This could be interpreted as expressing the need to connect to something that exists vastly beyond the current turbulent era, to put it into perspective and to find strength in knowing that nature transcends human troubles. The title text extends this theme. \n\nThe distant past, before the emergence of complex eye-bearing life, is illustrated by the final panel in black. This indicates that Randall is showing what is perceived rather than what was physically present, as light existed and would have made the Earth's surface visible, had there been eyes to see it. The dark far past may also be an analogy for the darkened far future, as there may be [https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/09/26/triple-whammy-of-extreme-heat-scientists-pinpoint-when-earth-could-become-uninhabitable no human life on Earth in around 250 million years]. This timeline is far beyond the immediate cares of the current world, applying further perspective to present worldviews.\n\n[[2013: Rock]] also compares the age of rocks to milestones in the development of life.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n\n:[Cueball is seen at a distance, walking amid a rocky landscape.]\n:I love being near Proterozoic rocks. \n:These ones are 1.1 billion years old.\n:That's so, '''''so''''' old.\n\n:[Cueball standing next to a rock.]\n:Eyes evolved half a billion years ago. The first time a rock was ever looked at, these rocks were already 500 million years old.\n\n:[Cueball sitting atop a large rock.]\n:People say geologic time makes them feel small. But when I touch this rock, it's like I'm a part of it, spanning a vast abyss of time that stretches back as far as the eye can see.\n\n:[A completely black panel except for text in white lettering.]\n:And then 500 million years farther.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*This comic was published on the day when {{w|Donald Trump}}'s re-election as president of the USA was announced. Randall was vocal in his support for the opposing candidate {{w|Kamala Harris}}; the xkcd homepage featured [https://web.archive.org/web/20241106175959im_/https://imgs.xkcd.com/news/harris_news@2x.png a drawing with a \"Vote for Harris\" sign] [https://web.archive.org/web/20241106215812/https://xkcd.com/ during the run-up to the election]<!-- archive.org did not record xkcd in the days leading up to the election, 2024-11-06 is the day after the election, but the pro-Harris banner was still present-->. The drawing remained in place through the remainder of the week, accompanying comic 3009.\n\n*The use of \"farther\" in the final panel could be erroneous; {{wiktionary|further#Usage notes|for some}}, \"further\" is the preferred word for metaphorical usage (e.g. for stretches of time).\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]"
