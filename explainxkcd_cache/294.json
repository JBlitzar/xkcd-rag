He quietly puts it back and turns to leave the store, only to have the book (which exists in his brain as information) set off the store's anti-theft sensor. This is a satire of copyright as it pertains to digital copies, because when you download a game or music file (or read a book, in this case), you are merely making an identical copy of the source material.\n\nThe title text suggests that if the security guard wants to do a brain search, he might want to skip over all the presumably sexual encounters Cueball has had with the security guard's mom, thus inducing a 'yo mama' joke.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in a bookstore, looking at a book.]\n:Cueball [thinking]: This book looks interesting. Maybe I'll buy it.\n\n:[Cueball reads the book; a clock appears above.]\n\n:Cueball [thinking]: Oops, I read the whole thing.\n:Cueball [thinking]: I'll just quietly put it back and go.\n\n:[Cueball walks through a security scanner to exit the bookstore.]\n:''BEEP BEEP BEEP''\n\n:Voice from off-frame: Hey! Your brain set off the sensor!\n:Cueball: I, uhh...\n:Voice from off-frame: You have a book in there, don't you!\n:Cueball: Crap.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]"
