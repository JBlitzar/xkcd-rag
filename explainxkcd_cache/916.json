The vault is labeled \"unpickable\" as a kind of challenge to break into it, while all the valuables are simply stored in a shoe box ''beside'' the vault. The misdirection at play here is an example of {{w|security through obscurity}}.\n\nA 24-pin dual-tumbler {{w|Tubular pin tumbler lock|radial-hybrid lock}} would probably be too bulky and cumbersome to actually exist. The key would be huge, or just plain ''long''. Given the length of the key, it would need to be extremely strong, and the length would be around 96mm, assuming that each notch is 5mm. In theory, though, it would be a remarkably difficult type of lock to pick. The fused 17th pin means that, even with the correct key, it cannot be opened. It would be much easier to simply break open the safe with brute force than to pick it. A simple and nerdy way to open the vault with brute force would be to use canned air, using the principle that cold objects are more brittle. Once the air is emptied onto the lock, it can be easily smashed with an ordinary hammer. The above discussion is an example of [[356|nerd sniping]] &mdash; since the vault is nearly unopenable, nerds and geeks would spend all their time on the vault and ignore the seemingly useless shoe box.\n\nThe title text continues the theme, with an unsolved {{w|Professor's_Cube|5x5x5}} Rubik's cube to further challenge and distract the thief.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:HackerShield \n:Geek-Proof Safe System:\n:[Two boxes sit side by side. One is a safe with a lock marked \"Unpickable.\" It is labeled: ① 24-pin dual-tumbler radial-hybrid lock (rendered unopenable by a fused 17th pin). The other is a shoebox. It is labeled: ② Shoebox containing your valuables.]\n\n{{Comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
