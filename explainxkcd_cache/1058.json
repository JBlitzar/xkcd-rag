Well, so was I.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn this comic the man with the beard thinks he is {{w|Leet}} and tries to show this to his conversations partner by calling her {{w|Newbie|noob}} (see also {{w|Leet#n00b|n00b}}). He claims that he has been on the internet since the BBS days, and thus long before his conversation partner was even born.\n\nA {{w|Bulletin Board System}}, or BBS, is an online service based on microcomputers running appropriate software. They were the precursors to modern day online forums.\n\nHowever, he is up against [[Jill]] who tells him he is wrong. She explains that her parents took samples of their sperm and egg and {{w|Genome#Sequencing_and_mapping|sequenced}} the {{w|DNA}}. The resulting {{w|genome}} was then e-mailed to the {{w|J. Craig Venter Institute|Venter Institute}} where they synthesized the genome and used this to create the egg and sperm that became Jill.\n\nThe J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) is a non-profit genomics research institute founded by {{w|J. Craig Venter}}, Ph.D. in October 2006. Although what Jill is describing may be possible this comic must take place in the future as this has not yet been used to create human beings.\n\nHer point though is, that the man is wrong when he says that he has been on the internet. When you are \"online\" you are really just looking on the screen where the results found \"on\" the internet is displayed. So, he has been '''looking''' at the internet. The girl's genome (which is basically the closest you can come to the data a computer would need to create you) has been sent on-line in an e-mail. So, in her words, she has actually '''been''' there.\n\nIt is also worth noting that it was [[Technically|technically]] her parents' sex cells, not her, which traversed the internet.\n\nThe title text is another common retort from \"old timers\" that they have been doing X since before the younger person was born. In this case, Jill accepts that the old timer was \"on the Internet\" before she was born, but so was she... At least in the form of her genetic information.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A man with black hair and a neck beard types away at his computer screen.]\n:Man (typing): Whatever, noob.
