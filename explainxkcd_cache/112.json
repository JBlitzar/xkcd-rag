The diagram is usually used to illustrate the overlap between various sets. For example, a Venn diagram of \"even numbers\" and \"numbers divisible by 5\" would have 2, 4, 6, 8, 12… in one circle, 5, 15, 25… in another circle, and 10, 20, 30… in the intersection of the circles (as those numbers fit into both sets).\n\nHere we have a three-set diagram that Randall has purportedly created to explain his feelings to his love interest. The three sets are:\n# People who can always make him smile\n# People he wants to spend the rest of his life with\n# People who constantly show him new things to love about the world.\n\nIn the intersection of these three sets is \"you\" – his love interest; all three of these statements apply to them. Normally, this might be a cute way of simply implying that he has these three feelings about them, without including any other elements in any of the sets.\n\nHere, however, Randall has included one other element: {{w|Vanilla Ice}} is shown to also constantly show Randall new things to love about the world, and to be someone Randall wants to spend the rest of his life with (although Vanilla Ice doesn't always make him smile).\n\n{{w|Vanilla Ice}} is a {{w|White Americans|white}} {{w|United States|American}} {{w|Rapping|rapper}} who was most popular in the early {{w|1990s}} with his song \"{{w|Ice Ice Baby}}.\" He was frequently mocked as a very \"white\" rapper. He is obviously an unexpected name to turn up in this diagram.\n\nApparently, Randall's love interest didn't take too well to Randall professing similar feelings for Vanilla Ice as he did for them, causing some friction in their relationship. The title text suggests that other '90s rappers have similarly affected Randall's past relationships.\n\nVanilla Ice also appears as an element of a romantic situation in [[159: Boombox]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Venn diagram with three sets]\n:Description of set 1: People who can always make me smile\n:Description of set 2: People who constantly show me new things about the world\n:Description of set 3: People I want to spend the rest of my life with\n:Intersection point: YOU.\n:Intersection of sets 2 and 3: Vanilla Ice\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Venn diagrams]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
