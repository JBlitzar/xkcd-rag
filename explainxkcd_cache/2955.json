However, when he tries to plant the pole to make the jump, the tip pierces the surface of the Earth, causing it to pop and violently deflate, like a balloon.\n\nThis does not normally happen during a pole vault,{{Citation needed}} but the title text suggests that the same recently happened during a {{w|Javelin throw|javelin}} competition, presumably when one of the spears pierced the surface in a similar manner to Cueball's pole. No explanation is provided for how the Earth was patched or re-inflated, but apparently the problem was solved in a single day, without needing to cancel the event, suggesting that this is a normal occurrence.\n\nThe comic ''may'' be inspired by the upcoming {{w|2024 Summer Olympics|Paris Olympics}}, and the geographical location of the burst is indeed somewhere in the European continent. The view of the ragged and deflating Earth suggests the possible epicenter of the burst has more of a vague relationship with that area than it might to [[Randall|Randall's]] own location in the US (the other 'logical' definite setting he might use). The comic precedes any of the actual official competitions (or indeed the official Opening Ceremony) by three weeks, but perhaps this event (and the javelin one) occurred at one or other of the attending nations' training camps, or national trials for a local athletics squad, already established in the general region. Alternatively, this is simply depicting future events.\n\nThree comics before this one Randall released [[2952: Routine Maintenance]], where the Earth is being subject to a routine maintenance by pushing the tip of a high pressure canister into Earth and blowing air into Earth to expel debris from inside Earth's volcanoes. That idea seems to be similar, but opposite to the one from this comic, in that here the Earth is a soft stretchable surface enclosing a pressurised gaseous interior, whereas in the previous comic it was a hard shell with gas filled cavities open to the exterior. With so few days between the releases there might have been some similar thoughts behind the creation of both.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding a pole vaulting stick up into the air while running.]\n\n:[Cueball puts the tip of the pole to the ground, making it bend, and causing damage to the ground as indicated with four small lines both above and below the ground where the tip touches it.]\n\n:[In a frame-less panel a big white word is shown inside a black blast bubble:]\n:<big>''Pop!''</big>\n\n:[In a black panel a white drawing shows that the Earth has burst, seemingly around Europe, and is now flying through space like a deflating balloon. A curving path is left behind indicating the path the Earth took, maybe indicating the matter (or air) expelled from the burst Earth. The part of the surface visible on the deflating Earth shows most of Asia and Australia and at the far left the eastern edge of Africa.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sport]]\n[[Category:Geology]]"
