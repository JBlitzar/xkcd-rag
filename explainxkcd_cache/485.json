''Depth'' continues the process, viewing logarithmically smaller scales from Earth's atmosphere down to the interior of a single {{w|proton}}. This combination is reminiscent of Charles and Ray Eames' 1977 short film [http://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0 Powers of Ten].\n\nHere's a walk through the entire comic:\n\n* At the top, we see a cutaway view of a story apartment complex. From left to right, different activities can be seen in the apartments; [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]] playing in a ball pit, Megan {{w|exorcising}} {{w|Windows Vista}}, [[Ponytail]] and Megan playing ''{{w|Guitar Hero}}'' or a similar game, Cueball at a desk, and what appear to be some sexytimes.\n* The view descends into Cueball's tower PC.\n* Entering the computer's internals, we see a mouse plugged into the PS/2 (6-pin mini-DIN) connector. This is a visual pun, since the mouse is an actual rodent and not a handheld device.\n* Next, we dive into the CPU. We see a multi-layered pun on the question \"how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\" There may be a pun with a chip's connector pin, but the more obvious reference is Randall's answer of 32,767 = 2<sup>15</sup> - 1, the largest possible value of a signed 16-bit integer. Adding one rolls back over to -32,768, which is 32,768 devils or \"negative angels.\" (See [[571: Can't Sleep]] for a similar joke and a more elaborate explanation.)\n* A blood-sucking mosquito appears to be \"leeching\" a torrent.\n* A {{w|segfault}} is a problem with memory access.\n* {{w|Dust mite}}s are small arachnids that feed on house dust and are known to cause allergies.  {{w|Rust mite}}s are very small mites that live on plants and cause discoloration of leaves and fruit, or small galls.\n* We zoom in on a memory unit on the CPU. Cueball is being {{w|rickrolled}}, as indicated by the label \"pixel on {{w|Rick Astley|Rick Astley's}} shoulder.\"\n* A \"fork();\" command points at one of several unlabeled spermatazoa. Forking and sperm are capable of spawning \"child processes.\"\n* {{w|Peter Norton}} is the founder of {{w|Norton Antivirus}}. He is shown fighting a biological virus, rather than informatic malware.\n* Showing the relative scale of {{w|carbon nanotubes}}, the suggestion is that these then lead on to a more megastructural {{w|Space Elevator}}, for which carbon nanotubes are often cited as a suitably strong component needed for the cable.\n* We soon zoom in on a silicon atom in the CPU. In the {{w|electron cloud}}, the squiggles made out of arrows are {{w|Feynman diagram}}s. A Feynman diagram in the shape of a stick figure is saying \"Sup?\", a pun on the \"Sup\" particle (supersymmetric partner 'squark' to the Up quark) and an abbreviation of the greeting \"What's up?\"\n* An 'iPod Femto' is shown, as a pun on the '{{w|iPod Nano}}' (both are {{w|SI prefixes}}), both of which refer to units far smaller than any iPod that has ever, or likely will ever, be created.\n* {{w|Brian Greene}} is a theoretical physicist and {{w|Popular science|pop scientist}} who discusses the nature of the universe. The picture of him knitting is a pun on {{w|string theory}} and PBS miniseries {{w|The Fabric of the Cosmos}}.  The term 'knitting furiously' shows up in the 1857 Volume 14, page 46 (available via [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x004827161&seq=54&q1=%22knitting+furiously%22 HathiTrust] and [https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/DX1902024403/NCUK?sid=bookmark-NCUK&xid=7a92dc49 Gale] <sub>([https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CDX1902024403 preview])</sub>) of {{w|The Monthly Packet}}. Furthermore, Greene doing something furiously references \"{{w|Colorless green ideas sleep furiously}}\", a correctly-formulated sentence that nonetheless conveys no meaning or logic.\n* The {{w|Planck length}} (<big>ℓ</big><sub>P</sub>) is the smallest theoretically measurable distance, defined by three fundamental constants in physics: the {{w|speed of light}} in a vacuum (c), {{w|Planck constant|Planck's constant}} (h), and the {{w|gravitational constant}} (G). The Planck length is vastly smaller than any known particle that isn't a point mass, and modern physics is a long way from investigating such a scale. The comic is 2,050 pixels tall, and Randall mentions the Planck length is roughly a further two thousand pixels past Brian Greene.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Sizes Accurate on a vertical log scale\n:[Series of images of characters doing various things.
