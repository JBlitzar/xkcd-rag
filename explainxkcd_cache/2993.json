Apparently, though, Randall couldn't actually think of anything cool that {{w|Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede}} and {{w|Callisto (moon)|Callisto}} would contribute, so these have just been used as 'filler'. (However, Ganymede does have a magnetic field, which is kind of cool....)\n\nNote that {{w|Moon|Earth's moon}} is the fifth-largest moon of the solar system overall ({{w|Europa (moon)|Europa}} is the sixth), so it would have been included had \"outer solar system\" not been specified.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name of moon\n!Ingredient\n!Volume<br>(billion (10⁹) km<sup>3</sup>)\n!Surface area<br>(million (10⁶) km<sup>2</sup>)\n!Mass<br>(sextillion (10²¹) kg)\n!Explanation\n|-\n| {{w|Io (moon)|Io}} || sulfur || style=\"text-align:center;\"|25.3 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|41.7 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|89.4 || Io is composed of hundreds of active volcanoes which produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.\n|-\n| {{w|Europa (moon)|Europa}} || oceans || style=\"text-align:center;\"|15.9 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.9 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|48.0 || Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean of liquid water below its icy crust.\n|- \n| {{w|Titan (moon)|Titan}} || hydrocarbons || style=\"text-align:center;\"|71.6 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|83.3 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|134.5 ||  Titan has a dense atmosphere of nitrogen, methane and other minor components, leading to the formation of hydrocarbon clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze.\n|-\n| {{w|Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede}} || rowspan=\"2\"|filler || style=\"text-align:center;\"|76.6 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|87.2 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|148.2 || rowspan=\"2\"|Randall considers Ganymede and Callisto to have no special features and uses them merely as “filler” for the combined planet.\n|-\n| {{w|Callisto (moon)|Callisto}} || style=\"text-align:center;\"|58.7 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|73.0 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|107.6\n|-\n|}\n\nIf all of these moons were lumped together, the total volume of “Randall's planet” would be 248 billion km<sup>3</sup>, assuming no further material compaction, with a surface area of 191 million km<sup>2</sup>. This is about 1½ times the volume of {{w|Mars}}, or roughly a 15% larger diameter. The combined mass, however, would be smaller than that of Mars.\n\nThe title text takes it further, treating asteroids as a [[1639: To Taste|“to-taste”]] ingredient in this “recipe”, more like preparing a food dish rather than making a new Mars-sized planet.\n\nThere are a number of science fiction works that posit that advanced alien civilizations left puzzles in the solar system for future humans to solve. Examples for this trope are {{w|Pushing Ice}} by Alastair Reynolds and {{w|Rogue Moon}} by Algis Budrys. The Arthur C. Clarke stories {{w|The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel}} and {{w|Encounter in the Dawn}} (and the more well-known ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' {{w|2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|book}} and {{w|2001: A Space Odyssey|film}} treatments that they later helped inspire) each feature various partial treatments of this concept. Caltech Professor David Goodstein also speculated in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHd__ed40M&t=1594s The Mechanical Universe] the possibility that {{w|Saturn}} is an alien message system.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A planet is shown with several different features like oceans and large lakes as well as and craters. It seems like the continent is fused together from five different segments, with cracks between where there is either ocean or rivers. There are four labels above the planet with lines going down to different areas of the planet, but not necessarily pointing to any particular part on the surface, but rather to the entire planet:]\n:Sulfur chemistry from Io\n:Cool oceans from Europa\n:Hydrocarbons from Titan\n:Ganymede and Callisto (filler)\n\n:[Caption beneath the panel:]\n:Scientists now think the five biggest outer solar system moons are actually just ingredients; we're supposed to combine them to create a single Mars-sized planet that's cooler than any of them.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Food]] <!-- Title is ingredients and the title text talks about adding to taste, making it seem like this is a recipe for food-->"
