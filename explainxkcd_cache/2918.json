This is assuming that the scale of the time axis is known, that the ticks are placed inside the axis line, and that the \"bottom\" of the graph is aligned with the line on which the ticks are drawn, rather than the \"peak\" of the largest tick.\n\nTheoretically, the graphed \"activity\" would be concealed behind the ticks, meaning anyone reading the graph would perceive activity as having ceased at the deadline, even though it had continued in time-axis-tick-sized bursts afterwards. In practice, this would be extremely difficult to do, since it may be impossible to predict what scale the graph might use and the intervals used for major and minor tick marks. Only if the chart designer used the same, consistent and predictable axis tick marks each time the chart was generated and refreshed, would this technique of hiding data amongst the axis tick marks be feasible. Software such as Microsoft Excel may have [https://peltiertech.com/how-excel-calculates-automatic-chart-axis-limits/ automatic axis algorithms] which may change the scaling and the position of the tick marks when generating charts. If the \"hidden\" data and the tick marks didn't align, you would get a [[1814: Color Pattern|Moiré effect]], which would likely lead to someone becoming suspicious and discovering the hidden data.\n\nThe title text continues with tips on how to make illicit transactions by integrating them in such a manner that makes them appear to be (or merge into) a graph inset, which would contain relevant information to the graph. For this to work convincingly, it would probably have to be a {{w|scatter plot}} or similar, rather than a {{w|bar chart}} or {{w|line chart}}, upon which carefully crafted datapoints could 'draw' a credible facsimile of [[688: Self-Description|graphical meta-features]]. This reference is timely because the comic came out during tax season, a period when many{{Citation needed}} Americans need to find an explanation for illicit transactions or sources of revenue.\n\nVariations (or possibly inversions) of pretending that actual data is part of the graphical framing device have also been previously seen in the [[1815: Flag|form]] of [[2528: Flag Map Sabotage|flags]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph with two axes is shown. Each axis has tick marks with every fourth mark a bit longer than those in between. The Y-axis is labeled with text rotated 90 degrees clockwise. There is no label on the X-axis. The graph is a jagged curve with three clear peaks; the area beneath the curve is shaded in light gray. After the third and highest peak the curve drops to zero. At the point of decline, a dotted line goes up to a label above the last peak. To the right of this dotted line, the X-axis and the ticks on it are clearly thicker than the axis and the ticks to the left.]\n:Y-axis: Activity\n:Label: Deadline\n\n:[Caption beneath the panel:]\n:If you need to conceal activity, try timing it to hide behind the tick marks on the graph axis.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Line graphs]]"
