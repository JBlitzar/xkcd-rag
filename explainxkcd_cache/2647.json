But his attempt to fool the staff (including [[Megan]] and [[:Category:Doctor Ponytail|Doctor Ponytail]]) fails when he mistakes a saline bag (as [https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/capri_suns_2x.png labeled when zoomed in]) for a Capri Sun juice drink.\n\n{{w|Capri Sun}} is a fruit juice concentrate beverage that comes in soft rectangular Mylar bags with a small seal near the top, to be pierced with an included straw so as to sip the drink. {{w|Saline (medicine)|Saline}} bags, used in hospitals and other medical settings, are also soft and rectangular, with an {{w|Intravenous therapy#Medical uses|intravenous}} (I.V.) drip connection about the same size as such straws, and usually contain a 0.9% sodium chloride (table salt) solution in sterile water so they are salty enough to be {{w|Tonicity#Isotonicity|isotonic}} with blood.

While they are dragging him out, he tries to point out that drinking saline is better than putting Capri Sun into a patient's I.V. drip, [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47623816 as it would endanger the patient], arguing that this mitigates the severity of his transgression. The guards apprehending him are unlikely to be persuaded, as impersonating hospital staff is a serious offense with dangerous risks and severe consequences.

Cueball is surrounded by hospital staff. To the left is Megan with a white hat, she is holding a clipboard, with a paper with unreadable text. To his right is Dr. Ponytail holding a rolled up paper under one arm and, to the right of her, a man with a similar hat as Megan. They are all looking at Cueball.]\n:Cueball: You know, these Capri Suns are good, but they're ''really'' salty.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I think the hospital may be starting to realize that I'm not actually a doctor.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Doctor Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]\n[[Category:Medicine]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
