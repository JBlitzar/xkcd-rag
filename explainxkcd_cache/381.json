It can be created by taking a strip of paper and twisting it 180 degrees before taping both ends together.\n\nThe idea of the Möbius strip has been used here to create a comic strip that could potentially loop forever. In it, [[Cueball]] is standing in front of a ball. Then another Cueball runs in and kicks the ball, which hits first Cueball in the head, due to which he falls out of the panel. The second Cueball then turns away, retaining the first Cueball's original position, only flipped horizontally. Because of the nature of the Möbius strip, if the comic strip were to be printed out in such a way that the comic could be seen on both sides of the paper &mdash; such on tracing paper, or on one \"side\" of a strip of clear plastic or film &mdash; the comic would repeat, so that the second Cueball would become the first Cueball, and someone else, potentially the original first person, would push them out of the comic becoming himself the first Cueball. This means that neither person ever really \"wins,\" and the comic could thus be conveying an anti-violence message in this respect. See also the title text of [[1890: What to Bring]].\n\nThe comic's viability as a Möbius strip preserved the use of symmetrical letters in a palindromic word to denote laughing (\"HAHAHAH\") as well as using symmetrical punctuation for the other character's [[wikt:grawlix#English|grawlixes]].  A similar use of a Möbius strip in story-telling can be seen in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdEsouIXGM Wind and Mr. Ug] by Vi Hart.\n\nFinally, at the title text, [[Randall]] jokes that he would like to see actual films do this solely as a joke on projectionists, who would have a difficult time feeding a Möbius strip film reel properly into a normal projector due to the twist.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing next to a ball.
