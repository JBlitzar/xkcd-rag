This is taken to its logical extreme in this comic when that Facebook feature repeatedly, in an increasingly voyeuristic fashion, tries to get Cueball to hook up with his occasional friend-with-benefits Susie, despite the fact that Cueball knows she's falling for him and doesn't want to lead her on.\n\nAccording to the title text, [[Cueball]] and Susie ''do'' end up hooking up, even against Cueball's better judgement, as so often happens between people who're physically attracted to one another. And he apparently left the webcam on as well, because the Facebook feature is now giving suggestions on what Cueball should do to her, mid-coitus. Obviously, this is not something that Facebook, a social networking site, can do... Yet.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at his computer. Facebook sidebar messages appear on the top of each panel, with a user photo of Susie (looking like Megan leaning forward so her hair hangs down the sides of her face) and a few lines of text.]\n:Facebook: Susie\n:Reconnect with her\n:[Phone icon] Send her a text\n:Cueball: Come on, Facebook. I know I shouldn't.\n\n:Facebook: Susie\n:She'd come over\n:[Bed icon] You don't have to fall asleep alone.\n:Cueball: It's been so hard to stop. But she's falling for me, and I can't keep getting her hopes up like this.\n\n:Facebook: Susie\n:Life is complicated\n:[Icon of stick figures embracing] She's so warm against you. You both want it.\n:Cueball: (pulling out phone) Maybe if I just make it clear it's not going to be a thing...\n:Cueball: Yeah, we'll just have a talk.\n\n:Facebook: Susie\n:Oh yeah. Mmm...\n:[Webcam icon] Leave your webcam on so I can watch.\n:Cueball: Okay, this feature is getting creepier and creepier.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]] <!-- As Megan is just a name for a girl drawn like Megan, then Susie is the every woman Megan also in this comic, since she do not have her own category -->\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]"
