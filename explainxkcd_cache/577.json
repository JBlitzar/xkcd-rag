''{{w|Firefly (TV series)|Firefly}}'' was a television series aired by Fox in 2002 that got cancelled mid-way through, but it has a large fan base nowadays (for a more comprehensive explanation, see the Wikipedia page). The star of the show was Captain Malcolm (or Mal) Reynolds, played by [[Nathan Fillion]]. So, in this comic, [[Megan]] tells [[Cueball]] that Nathan Fillion has an electric skateboard. [[Cueball]] immediately starts planning a trip to visit and race Nathan Fillion. Electric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like [[139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards]], [[409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic)]] and a panel in [[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel]].\n\nThe title text refers to an earlier comic [[211: Hamster Ball Heist]], where [[Cueball]] kidnaps Wayne Coyne in his hamster ball.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. These are all the comics in [[:Category:The Race|The Race series]]:\n* [[577: The Race: Part 1]]\n* [[578: The Race: Part 2]]\n* [[579: The Race: Part 3]]\n* [[580: The Race: Part 4]]\n* [[581: The Race: Part 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:Megan: Huh, cool. Nathan Fillion (Mal from Firefly) has an electric skateboard. Just like you!\n\n:[Cueball leaves the room.]\n\n:Megan: Did you hear that? Nathan-\n:Sounds from off-screen: ''Ratchet Zip Buckle''\n\n:[Cueball returns wearing helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, sunglasses and holding his electric skateboard.]\n:Cueball: I heard. Gimme the computer. I need to book a flight.\n\n:[Caption in a black frame at the bottom of the last panel:]\n:To be continued...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:The Race]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|The Race]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Nathan Fillion]]\n[[Category:Firefly]]\n[[Category:Electric skateboard]]\n[[Category:Hamster balls]]"
