You guys all have that dream, right? It's not just me. Right?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis was the first comic with one of [[Randall|Randall's]] [[:Category:Fun fact|fun facts]]. \n\nStudents often {{w|dream}} they have assignments they have forgotten about that are due in a very short time period, leaving no time to complete the assignment, thus filling them with the feeling of impending failure. The panic and helplessness of being unable to complete the work in time only subsides when the dreamer wakes from the {{w|nightmare}}, although sometimes they wake to a reality where there actually is a looming deadline. \n\nThis comic suggests these dreams continue well after graduation, although there may be a nagging feeling that \"I thought I completed everything and graduated\".\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Tommy_Oliver|Green Ranger}} from the ''{{w|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}'', or, indeed, any of the many Power Rangers/Super Sentai seasons with a green ranger. {{w|Crisco}} is a brand of vegetable shortening, a fat that is solid at room temperature and frequently used in baking. The joke is that [[Randall]] has a very odd recurring dream, and wants reassurance that he is not the only one... but he likely is!\n\nEleven years later, Megan tells Cueball that just the thought of being in a crowded classroom (even without concerns about an assignment) is scary enough in comic [[2285: Recurring Nightmare]]. But that was due to the [[:Category:COVID-19|COVID-19 pandemic]] starting in 2020.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan as a teacher speaks to a crowded classroom, where all students are grayed out except one of the Cueball students who is drawn in the normal black line.]\n:Megan: Your projects are due today by 5:00 PM.\n:Cueball (thinking): ...I didn't even know we had one.\n\n:[Zoom in on Cueball at his small desk still thinking. No other students are visible, but the desk next to his is shown although also fading out.]\n:Cueball (thinking): Wait. I don't think I've been attending. I must have forgotten I had this class. Shitshitshit.\n\n:[Cueball is sitting at his desk, but now seen from the side, looking from the edge of his desk. The very right part of the drawing, with Cueball's back and chair, now begins to fade.]\n:Cueball (thinking): Okay, I'm gonna fail. Will it hold me back? I just want to get out of here. I thought I had ''finished'' my requirements already.\n\n:[Cueball takes his hand to his face. This panel fades so much it is only about half a panel. Even the frame around the panel disappears.]\n:Cueball (thinking): In fact, I think I remember graduating. What the hell isâ€”\n\n:[As the previous scene completely fades we find Cueball waking up in his bed with small blobs above his head to indicate the dream disappearing.]\n\n:[Caption below the last three panels of the comic:]\n:Fun Fact: Decades from now, with school a distant\n:memory, you'll <u>still</u> be having this dream.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nThis comic was linked to by ''Don't shoot the pianist'' in their Opus 54, [https://euge.ca/54/ Nightmare]. The structure is similar, but it's specifically about music students.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Dreams]]\n[[Category:Fun fact]]"
