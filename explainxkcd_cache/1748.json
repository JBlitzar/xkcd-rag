Is that right?\" \"... yes. Yes, exactly.\"\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic is a direct continuation of the previous comic [[1747: Spider Paleontology]] about a {{w|time travel|time-traveling}} energy Sphere who came back from the future to see [[:Category:Spiders|spiders]]. Since [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]] now have access to the Sphere from the future, they ask if it knows who will win the election. This is a reference to the {{w|2016 United States presidential election}}, which pitted the ''very'' controversial [[Donald Trump]] against former United States First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State {{w|Hillary Clinton}}, who was also involved in several {{w|Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy|controversies}}. This comic was released about three weeks before election day. (The election was the subject of the comic released the day before the election [[1756: I'm With Her]], in which [[Randall]] endorsed Clinton directly.)\n\nSadly for Megan and Cueball, the sphere has come back from so far into the future that even spiders have gone extinct. (Whether humans also have is unclear, see [[1747: Spider Paleontology]]). The Sphere makes this clear by stating that its civilization hardly knows anything about our era, and they know little about our history and culture. (And by the way it only came back for the spiders, anyway). The idea is that history is filtered in similar fashion to fossils. What is contemporaneously important, like a {{w|spider web|spider's web}}, {{w|Feathered dinosaur|dinosaur feathers}} (see previous comic), or the United States presidential election may not survive. The Sphere tells them that only two written accounts have been reconstructed (note that they are not found in their entirety). And they do not know whether they even represent real events or myths. One of the two is indeed a myth, as it is about a man building a boat to survive a great flood. Megan recognizes this as being about {{w|Noah}} and his famous {{w|Noah's Ark|Ark}} from the {{w|Genesis flood narrative}}, as Cueball refers to. The other is a reference to a popular pop song.\n\nThe joke is that, in the future, the 2000 {{w|Aaron Carter}} hip hop song \"{{w|That's How I Beat Shaq}}\" ([http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aaroncarter/thatshowibeatshaq.html lyrics] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfhhWA9GF0M video]) is considered as valuable a historical document when researching humans as parts of the {{w|Bible}}. While secular historians consider the story of the Flood to be mythical, they still use it to infer facts about the early history of the Middle East, simply because there are a fairly small number of texts surviving from that era. \"That's How I Beat Shaq\" is, likewise, a fictional story including some true elements; it's just that as long as there are abundant sources documenting life in the year 2000, there's no reason to consult the song in any historical context. Yet it is the latter story that the time traveler assumes to be a clearly religious one, while seeing the former as a relatively straightforward survival story. A further layer of humor is that \"That's How I Beat Shaq\" is an archetypal {{w|David and Goliath}} story&mdash;the story of David and Goliath of course being a Biblical one as well. \n\nIn fact, the Spheres civilization believes Shaq ({{w|Shaquille O'Neal}}, a 2.16 m (7 ft 1 in) tall professional basketball player) to be a god, who was then defeated by Aaron, a 14-year-old (and rather small kid) at the time of the release of his single in 2001. He beats Shaq on the basketball court one on one. Megan comments that the pop song may have been mangled by the {{w|Aeon|eons}}.\n\nThe title text expands on the joke by letting the Sphere explain that the only connection they have found between their two historical documents is via the biblical story of {{w|Moses}}. As Moses is one of God's chosen prophets and leaders, like Noah and {{w|Abraham}} before him, these two stories appear close together in the Bible, though not close together chronologically, and it would be likely that their document with the Flood story also has some parts about Moses. Moses had an older biological brother named {{w|Aaron}} and the Sphere's civilization has hastily concluded that Moses' brother and Aaron Carter are the same. According to the Bible, God {{w|parting of the Red Sea|parted the Sea of Reeds (commonly mistranslated as Red Sea)}} for Moses and the {{w|Israelites}}. This is often referred to, either erroneously or out of simplification, as Moses having parted the Red Sea. Along with Noah's Flood, this is one of the two major times in the Bible that God effects grand change on a body or bodies of water.\n\nThis comic was published the day after the ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article ''{{what if|152|Flood Death Valley}}'', thus referring indirectly to a new possible flood history. It was the first what if? post in almost three months, the longest break between two post during 2016 (and third longest of all time at the time of its release), and it thus seems reasonable that there should be some kind of connection between that and this comic. A later comic ([[1750: Life Goals]]) also referenced this what if? post more or less directly. In this comic, Randall managed to combine no less than four of his favorite recurring subjects with [[:Category:Time travel|time travel]], [[:Category:Spiders|spiders]], [[:Category:Politics|politics]] and [[:Category:Religion|religion]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The Sphere, a time-traveler depicted as a solid floating black energy sphere surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments (first seen in the previous comic), is floating in front of Megan and Cueball who is walking after it towards the right part of the panel. The Sphere looks like this in all panels, but in the zoom in from panel two more details can be seen. A voice emanates from the Sphere.]\n:Megan: Since you're from the future, do you know who wins the election?\n:Sphere: Haven't the faintest idea. Hardly any text has been recovered from your era, so we know little about your history and culture.\n:Sphere: <small>We're mostly here for the spiders, anyway. </small>\n\n:[A close-up of the Sphere, still depicted as a black sphere, but not perfectly round at this zoom level and also clearly with some white dots in the dark area. It is still surrounded by six narrow rays with irregular dots between the rays.]\n:Sphere: There are only two written accounts we've reconstructed.\n:Sphere: We don't know whether they describe real events or myths.\n\n:[The Sphere is now on the left side of Megan and Cueball who has stopped walking and has turned to look at the Sphere.]\n:Sphere: One is a story about a man who built a boat to survive a great flood.\n:Megan: Oh yeah. Noah.\n:Cueball: We do like our flood narratives.\n\n:[The Sphere has drifted further away from Megan and Cueball.]\n:Sphere: The other is an account of how a man named Aaron Carter defeated a god named Shaq.\n:Megan: That one may have been mangled a bit by the eons.\n\n==Trivia==\nBoth [[1747: Spider Paleontology]] and this comic have a title composed of a noun followed by a field of research.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]] <!-- Arron and Shaq -->\n[[Category:Time travel]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Basketball]] <!-- Shaq -->\n[[Category:Songs]]  <!-- Arron -->\n[[Category:Time-Traveling Sphere]]"
