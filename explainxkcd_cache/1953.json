His tweet is signed using two emoji to form his name, referencing the cattle breed called {{w|Angus cattle}} and the crown emoji. The tweet was released February 7th, only two days before the comic.\n\nAn {{w|character encoding|encoding of a character set}} is a mapping from characters to numbers. For example, the letter \"A\" is be represented by the value 65. At the time, some languages, such as Japanese, had several incompatible character encodings, which meant different characters could be represented by the same value. {{w|Unicode}} was developed to solve this by providing all the encodings for all the various characters used in the world's languages for a single character. Unicode is run by {{w|Unicode Consortium|a consortium}} of major technology companies and stakeholders. The founders of Unicode include {{w|Joe Becker (Unicode)|Joe Becker}}, who worked for Xerox in the 1980s.  He has a beard and may be the character featured in the first and last panels of the comic.\n\nNew characters have continued to be added to Unicode, and recently many \"{{w|emoji}}\" (picture characters) have been added.  Emoji were originally added to be compatible with text message encodings in Japan, but after devices in other countries started supporting them as part of Unicode, they caught on worldwide.  Now emoji characters are added for their own sake, not just for compatibility. The [https://emojipedia.org/lobster/ lobster emoji], ü¶û, was approved as part of Unicode 11, for release in 2018. This comic was published on February 10, 2018‚Äé.\n\nThe title text imagines that Unicode will gain other unexpected roles in the next 30 years. In particular it acts as an armed force, capable of intervening in military disputes, such as an annexation of Maine by its neighbour, New Hampshire. The title text ends with three Unicode emoji: \"üôè\" code point 1F64F \"PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS\", \"üöÅ\" code point 1F681 \"HELICOPTER\", and \"üéñ\" code point 1F396 \"MILITARY MEDAL\", suggesting that they are thanking them for their effort in the war, sending helicopters and soldiers to aid them against New Hampshire. The phrase \"we're once again an independent state\" may also be a political pun, as 2048 should be an election year, and King is an independent senator.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[1988:]\n:[A bearded man holds a document labelled \"Unicode\". Most likely he represents Joe Becker.]\n:Bearded man: My \"Unicode\" standard should help reduce problems caused by incompatible binary text encodings.\n\n:[2018:]\n:[A tweet from Twitter is shown. To the left of Senator Angus King's name is his avatar (a face with a mustache) and to the right is the blue checkmark used by Twitter to signify a verified user.]\n:Senator Angus King‚Äè\n:<span style=\"color:gray\">@SenAngusKing</span>\n:Great news for Maine - we're getting a lobster emoji!!!

This was later fixed.\n\n*Ironically, [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=1953:_The_History_of_Unicode&oldid=152168 the first version of this wiki article] (automatically generated by a bot) had problems with emoji encoding.\n\n*At one time the scenario in the title text wouldn't have been ''quite'' as far-fetched as it sounds. Maine and New Hampshire were for many years involved in border disputes, primarily over {{w|New Hampshire v. Maine|fishing rights}} and whether {{w|Seavey%27s Island|Seavey Island}}, located in the middle of the river that forms the border of the two states, was part of Maine or New Hampshire. The latter issue {{w|Piscataqua River border dispute|was not settled until 2002}}. Neither dispute ever quite rose to the level of a full-on shooting war but [http://nhpr.org/post/legacy-nh-maine-lobster-war-and-why-it-may-wage#stream/0 they got surprisingly close].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]\n[[Category:Unicode]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
