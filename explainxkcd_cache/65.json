The waitress walked up around panel 5 and was somewhat put off.\n}}\n==Explanation==\nTwo guys are trash-talking each other with {{w|homophobic}} comments and {{w|Maternal insult|\"your mom\" jokes}}. It goes somewhat astray and becomes awkward when the first guy makes a pass at the second guy and is rejected. Part of the element of the humor in this comic stems from a common assertion that the most homophobic of men are the most likely to be a {{w|closeted homosexual}}. Another element is the incredible awkwardness of the end conversation, with both characters standing awkwardly for the last 2 panels.\n\n{{w|Faggot (slang)|Fag}}, {{w|ass pirate}}, {{w|fudge packer}}, and {{w|List of LGBT slang terms|cock jockey}} are all insults for a {{w|homosexual}} man, while cum dumpster can apply to both men and women. These terms were not generally considered more than mildly offensive by most of the public at the time this comic was posted. The cultural mainstream is now typically much more critical of this type of language, and this comic would likely be heavily criticized if it were published today.\n\nIn the title text, he says he mock-held this conversation with a friend in a {{w|T.G.I. Friday's|TGIF}} restaurant, indicating how awkward this would be in real life. Even the waitress, a bystander, is put off by it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cueball like characters have a discussion. They are drawn the same in all eight panels.]\n:Guy: Man, she's hot\n:Friend: Whatever, you are so gay.\n\n:Guy: C'mon, everyone knows you're the gay one.\n:Friend: Hey, your mom's pretty masculine, but sleeping with her doesn't make me gay.\n\n:Guy: Fag.\n:Friend: Ass pirate.\n:Guy: Fudge packer\n:Friend: Cock jockey\n:Guy: Cum dumpster.\n\n:[Beat panel.]\n\n:Guy: Okay, seriously, are you gay? Because if you've been holding out on me, we're missing out.\n\n:Friend: No, it's cool.\n:Guy: OK, me neither.\n\n:[Beat panel.]\n\n:[Beat panel.]\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Homosexuality]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
