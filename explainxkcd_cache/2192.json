The review is written as a video game review, praising the [[1110: Click and Drag|size]] and aesthetics of the world. The comic's humor draws from the fact that gamers cannot use reviews to decide whether they want to \"play\" the Earth,{{citation needed}} and the fact that there's no place that the Earth can be reviewed (with the possible exception of [[1803: Location Reviews|Google, Yelp]], or ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''). The \"huge world\" remark is a play on {{w|Open world}} games like {{w|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt}}, which are praised when their size allows hundreds of hours of exploration; exploring Earth would allow more than a few hundred hours of novelties.\n\nEarth (or humans and other life forms on Earth) has many problems at the moment, such as {{w|war}}, [[:Category:Climate change|climate change]], {{w|overpopulation}}, {{w|gun violence}}, {{w|sexual violence}}, {{w|censorship}}, {{w|poverty}}, and increasing {{w|Depression (mood)|depression}}, to name just a few. This comic serves as a reminder that, despite these issues, the world is a five-star world. It encourages us to look around: there's a lot of world to explore.\n\nA game of fictional reviews of Earth can be found on the website neal.fun on [https://neal.fun/earth-reviews/ Earth Reviews].\n\nThe title text states that the 'controls are hard to figure out', possibly alluding to the fact that it takes a lot of time to learn how to walk and talk, a rather basic thing in most video games, or to the fact that it is in general hard to navigate around in one's life, as has been the subject of many comics.\n\nWhile there aren't any games that can recreate the detail that reality has (Due to the computing power required to do such a thing would be on an intergalactic level to recreate Earth 1 to 1 in a simulation), there are some games that attempt to have a map that is similar in area or graphics that look as detailed as reality. However, there are many games that have successfully implemented difficult game-play/hard to learn controls.\n\nExamples of games with large worlds: {{w|World of Warcraft}}, {{w|Fallout 3}}, the {{w|Red Dead}} series, {{w|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}}, {{w|Minecraft}}, the {{w|Grand Theft Auto}} series, {{w|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt}}, {{w|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild}}, {{w|Elden Ring}}.\n\nExamples of games with difficult controls: the {{w|Souls (series)|Souls series}}, {{w|Bloodborne}}, {{w|Stephen's Sausage Roll}}, {{w|Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy}}, {{w|Elden Ring}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A profile picture of Cueball in a small frame is next to five solid yellow stars.
