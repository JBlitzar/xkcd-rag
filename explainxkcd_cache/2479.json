Except the spare room off the living room. Don't go in there, we're not fully vaccinated in there.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is another entry in a [[:Category:COVID-19|series of comics]] related to the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}, specifically regarding the [[:Category:COVID-19 vaccine|COVID-19 vaccine]].\n\nWith COVID-19 vaccines under distribution, more and more people are becoming fully vaccinated. [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] have apparently become part of that group, and Cueball notes that with the vaccine in their systems, they can once again start hosting people at their house &mdash; the various local and national rules maintained to mitigate infections now allowing indoors association in such circumstances for many individuals. Megan concurs, indicating they have been looking forward to having their friends over.\n\nAfter a beat panel, Cueball notes that if they intend to host people, they need to clean the house. Megan promptly backtracks on her eagerness to have people over, implying that her reluctance to complete this task (possibly a rather onerous one, if they have been neglecting housework during the pandemic) may outweigh her desire to socialize. Megan claims she only feels 98% vaccinated, and thus is not completely ready for houseguests; Cueball agrees that they need to wait a few more days before they are 100% vaccinated/ready for guests.\n\nThe earlier vaccination-related comic [[2460: Vaccinated]] depicted Cueball and Megan as not very skilled at [[:Category:Social interactions|social interactions]], so it's possible they may not have many \"people\" to invite over anyway, or may be awkward with those they do invite over.\n\nThe title text continues the theme of \"vaccination status = houseguest readiness\" and assumes that this is an association of one state with the other that is commutative - that is, reversible, with either one implying the other.\n\nIn the title text, it appears Cueball and Megan have cleaned ''most'' of their house in preparation for having guests, with the evident exception of the spare room next to the living room, which is perhaps being used to store junk from the other rooms. Thus they pretend that in that room they are not fully vaccinated, as if their vaccination status is dynamically influenced by their location in their home rather than, for instance, by the memory of their {{w|adaptive immune system}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: Now that we're fully vaccinated, we can invite people over.\n:Megan: Exciting!\n\n:[Same setting, without talk. Beat panel.]\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are standing in a wider panel. Megan is looking down at her torso while holding her arms out from her body.]\n:Cueball: Which means we have to clean.\n:Megan: ...You know, I suddenly feel only about 98% vaccinated.\n:Cueball: Yeah, let's give it a few more days.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:COVID-19 vaccine]]\n[[Category:COVID-19]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
