I'm a superhero who specializes in the study of God's creation of Man in the Book of Genesi-- HOLY SHIT A GIANT BUG!\n}}\n==Explanation==\nThis is following the comic [[1010: Etymology-Man]]. The superhero Etymology-Man returns and, just like in his first appearance, explains the origination of words instead of actually helping. {{w|Etymology}} is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time.\n\nIn this comic, a group of scientists is in a lab, fighting off a giant mantis and some smaller mantises (which are nonetheless much larger than a typical praying mantis. Compared to the size of the people in this comic, the smaller mantises appear to be 8-12 inches long). One [[Cueball]] is firing a gun and [[Ponytail]] is brandishing a baseball bat, while the giant mantis grabs one Cueball by the leg, dangling him upside down. Behind the table, another Cueball is listening to Etymology Man speak. The joke here is that the scientists called the wrong hero for help. They instead wanted Entomology-Man. {{w|Entomology}} is the study of insects. Instead of calling Entomology-Man, who could probably help with fighting off the mantises, they have accidentally called Etymology-Man, due to the similarities in their names. Etymology-Man can only explain the origin of words, making him useless in this current situation. He also has flight powers that could be used to evacuate the scientists, but as seen in [[1010: Etymology-Man]], etymology takes full priority for him.\n\nIn the title text, we find out the scientists accidentally call another superhero focused on the creation of {{w|Adam}} in the Biblical book of Genesis. This might be {{w|Etiology}}-Man (the study of causation and attribution), {{w|Ontology}}-Man (the study of being and existence), {{w|Ethnology}}-Man (the study of human character, with a focus on its formation and evolution).  Or perhaps {{w|Anthropology}}-Man or {{w|Anthropogeny}}-Man. \"Adam-ology-Man\" would be a more direct pun to the first man, himself, but has less of a basis in an actual \"-ology\" and leaves the creation part of the 'hint' as superfluous. It is also possible that they asked for another hero fighting the mantis, but who came was \"man-theology-man\" (not manteology-man).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A giant praying mantis attacks a team of scientists, along with its legion of smaller-but-still-unusually-large mantises. Two of the scientists fight back, with a gun and a baseball bat respectively, while a third is in the mantis' clutches, held aloft by his foot, his goggles falling off his face. Bullets whiz by the giant mantis' head and a fourth scientist hides behind a desk, on which rests a microscope and an Erlenmeyer flask. A man in a cape approaches the hiding scientist.]\n:Etymology-man: Ah, noâ€”you wanted '''''ENTO'''''mology-Man, spelled with an \"N\". See, it's from the Greek ''entomon'', meaning \"insect,\" which is itself the neuter form of ''entomos'', meaning \"segmented\" or...\n:'''BLAM BLAM BLAM'''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Etymology-Man]]"
