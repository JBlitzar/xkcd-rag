He may be under the impression that dinosaurs looked like their skeletons and therefore, were \"rocks\" that could walk, or perhaps just that their skeletons were actually made of rock, making those 'rocks' more cool than our modern inanimate ones.\n\nThe title text suggests that {{w|turtles}} are a form of animate rock. This could be interpreted in two ways. In the first interpretation, you could say that their hard shells make them seem like rocks that are able to move on their own. This gives the latest approximation to modern \"rocks\" that do more or look cooler than just plain old rocks. In the second interpretation, the text could be generalizing the idea of bone-based armor as \"rocks\" to other animals. This would include other armored animals like armadillos and pangolins. Extending it beyond bone-based to any hard outer construction could encompass many other life forms - for example, shellfish and corals.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are standing beside each other in what is presumably a museum, and are viewing a stegosaurus skeleton. The skeleton stands on a pedestal and there is a placard on a stand in front of it.  The rib cage and head of the skeleton are visible to us; the rear of the skeleton is outside the frame of the panel.]\n\n:[Panel of just Cueball and Megan.]\n:Cueball: Wow.\n\n:[Cueball and Megan standing.]\n:Cueball: Rocks used to be '''''so cool'''''.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Geology]]"
