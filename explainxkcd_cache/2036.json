Here [[Cueball]] annoys [[White Hat]], a graph theory Ph.D., by calling him an edgelord. \n\nThe exact same setting, with different text, was later used in [[2744: Fanservice]], and [[2654: Chemtrails]] also used the same setting except it is [[Ponytail]] that gets annoyed.\n\n\"Edgelord\" is modern slang describing a brash, pretentious provocateur on social media, often provoking in a satirical way that if taken literally would be found disturbing or insensitive. The term derives from the word \"edgy\", which is used to describe things which are designed to be provocative. \"Edgy\" and \"edgelord\" are quite derogatory, carrying further implications of being style over substance, or having appeal only with rambunctious teenagers. \n\nIn mathematics, {{w|Graph theory|graph theory}} is the study of graphs, mathematical structures made up of nodes (points) which are connected by edges (or lines). This comic plays on the fact that graphs have edges. Calling someone with a graph theory Ph.D. an 'edgelord' (a master of edges) is somewhat analogous to calling an engineering student a 'forcelord', an astronomy Ph.D. a '{{w|Star-Lord|starlord}}', or a pharmacologist a '{{w|druglord}}'.\n\nIn reply to being called an edgelord by Cueball, White Hat shouts \"No\" and clenches his fists in anger - which is ironic, as he seems to be on edge. Because \"edgelord\" is perceived as an insult by socially aware adults, Cueball is actually provoking White Hat, making ''Cueball'' an edgelord in this interaction.  Similar situational humor is also found in [[2008: Irony Definition]].\n\nThe title text makes the same joke, except that the title would be hyperedgelord instead of edgelord. A {{w|Hypergraph|hypergraph}} is a generalization of a graph in which each edge may have more than two endpoints. The term \"hyper edge\" could easily be considered stereotypically \"edgy.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is talking to White Hat, who is balling his fists and has small lines above his head to indicate annoyance.]\n:Cueball: So, I hear you're a real edgelord.\n:White Hat: '''''No!'''''\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:How to annoy a graph theory Ph.D.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:How to annoy]]"
