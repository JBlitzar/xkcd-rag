But there have been several [[:Category:Substitutions|comics using substitutions]] both before and after these ones. This is the entire Substitutions series:\n*[[1288: Substitutions]] \n*[[1625: Substitutions 2]]\n*[[1679: Substitutions 3]]\n\nRandall is playing off of the fact that many readers of modern news articles quickly become bored with the legal and political jargon. He suggests that substituting certain words for others can make reading the article more interesting, albeit less accurate. Although since Randall doesn't think very highly of the news, he's probably suggesting this chart wouldn't make them less accurate at all. (See for instance [[558: 1000 Times]] and [[932: CIA]].). For example, a sentence that reads:\n\n{{Quote|Witnesses reported that the suspect allegedly escaped unharmed.}}\n\nwould be changed to\n\n{{Quote|These dudes I know reported that the suspect kinda probably escaped unharmed.}}\n\nThis substitution does not change the meaning much, and the original sentence does not lose much of its accuracy. However, for substitutions later in the comic, a sentence may be changed as follows:\n\n{{Quote|A new study finds that senators and other congressional leaders are increasingly likely to view election results on their smartphone.}}\n\ninto\n{{Quote|A Tumblr post finds that elf-lords and other river spirits are increasingly likely to view eating contest results on their Pokédex.}}\n\nWhich is less meaningful, but more interesting. The final substitution returns from the realm of the ridiculous to replacing \"could not be reached for comment\" with \"is guilty and everyone knows it.\" If a journalist writes a story about an accused suspect but is unable to contact them or receives no response from them, they will write that the person \"could not be reached for comment.\" Randall's whimsical assumption that silence implies guilt is so common that juries are instructed that they should not infer guilt if the defendant fails to testify, particularly in nations that have a right against self-incrimination. 'Spaaace' could be a reference to the Space Core from {{w|Portal 2}}, or to the way {{w|The Muppet Show}} presented [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHsr7Chmff8 Pigs in Spaaace].\n\nThe {{w|Virtual Boy}} is a table-top video game console made by Nintendo released in 1995 and discontinued about the same year. It achieved true-3D graphics through the use of a large visor containing a pair of LED screens, though it is considered as having done so incredibly poorly, while also lacking any form of ergonomic comfort and sporting several critical design flaws. As a result, it is commonly mocked as one of Nintendo's biggest failures (sometimes by Nintendo itself). The [https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex Pokédex] is a device in the [https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_world Pokémon world] that records the data of captured Pokémon. {{w|Homestar Runner}} is the title character of a Flash-animated web cartoon series, known for being an idiot.\n\nIt seems generally that Randall is no fan of Google Glass, which was also shown earlier in [[1251: Anti-Glass]] and later in [[1304: Glass Trolling]]. Thus, explaining why Google Glass has such a ridiculous substitution as ''Virtual Boy''. Google Glass has become a [[:Category:Google Glass|recurring theme]] in xkcd. In the title text, [[Elon Musk]] is mentioned. He is (amongst other things) the CEO of {{w|Tesla Motors}}, which produces electric cars. In the title text \"atomic cats\" replaced the sentence \"Electric cars\" according to the chart of the comic. News reports about new studies ({{w|Tumblr}} posts) are further lampooned in [[1295: New Study]], a comic posted two weeks later.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:'''Substitutions''' that make reading the news more fun:\n\n:[A table of words/sentences on the left that changes into those on the left.
