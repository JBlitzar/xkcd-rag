This practice was far more common in the years leading up to this comic, when high-traffic and poorly-moderated social media sites tended to display comments in increasing chronological order by default; as such, the oldest comments would be most prominently displayed at the top, while the newest comments would be buried at the bottom.\n\nIn the first two panels, [[Cueball]] stares at his screen, implying that a long time passes before he finally points this out. He has probably submitted a post and is awaiting for comments that are not coming. Cueball might actually have mixed feelings about the practice slowly dying out. However, someone offscreen is worried he will jinx it, encouraging more people to do so.\n\nIn reality, Cueball's observation has held true, due to changes in best practices for web design. Social media sites in particular often sort comments by user rating; as such, the most appreciated comments are given the most prominence, and trollish comments like the cliche \"F1rst p0st!!\" are buried. Meanwhile, low-traffic forums with smaller communities still display comments from oldest to newest; in these environments, firstposters are reported and dealt with by human moderators in a timely fashion. In short, the internet as a whole does not reward or reinforce firstposting the way it once did pre-2013. However, the small children who think that posting \"FIRST!!!\" makes them somehow relevant or funny still remain. Only growing up and realising how unnecessary and obnoxious posting \"first\" is will stop them.\n\nSee also [[269: TCMP]] and [[1019: First Post]].\n\nThe title text sarcastically states that no new annoying internet behaviors have emerged since the \"first post\" trend began which would continue to annoy users: a fact which is clearly wrong to anyone who spends a length of time on the internet. See for instance [[493: Actuarial]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at his desk in an office chair, using a computer.]\n\n:[Cueball is still sitting at the desk, but with hands off the keyboard in his lap.]\n\n:[Cueball is in the same position as before, talking with off-panel.]\n:Cueball: After a couple of unbearable decades, the \"first post\" thing seems to be dying a quiet death.\n:Off-screen: ''Shh.'' You'll jinx it.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"
