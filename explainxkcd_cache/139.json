This comic shows a simple move where [[Cueball]] drives one from A to B. \n\nIt's not very artistic, but the \"chicks\" are cheering, and the comic states that this is how they work. The humor of the comic is an understated joke that if you use an electric skateboard just to get around, by the time you get to where you are going, there will already be a group of chicks cheering and following you just because electric skateboards are awesome.  (The pickup artist in [[1178: Pickup Artists]] would be disappointed to learn that this is not actually accurate, as it would save him the bother of \"sleazy\" social manipulation of the desired \"chicks,\" assuming they can afford to acquire an electric skateboard instead.)\n\nIn the title text, Randall tells us that both of his two electric skateboards were cheap and have been worn down by heavy use. If he ever moves to the city, he will buy a really nice skateboard. If it is to be able to get around over the shorter distances of the city or if it is just because there are many more \"chicks\" to impress is left up to the reader's imagination.\n\nElectric skateboards have been the subject of [[:Category:Electric skateboard|several other comics]], but this was the first. It has been featured most prominently in [[:Category:The Race|The Race]], a five part comic series.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panels:]\n:How electric skateboards work:\n\n:[Cueball is standing on a skateboard, just to the right of a sign. He pushes a button on the remote he has in his hand. The remote is connected to his skateboard through a wire.]\n:Sign: Point A\n:''Click''\n\n:[Cueball skates while he stands still on the board.]\n:''Whirrrr''\n\n:[He stops just in front of another sign. To his left are three girls; Megan, Ponytail, and another Megan-like girl with even longer hair than the first. Below them are three arrows pointing to each of them and a label connected to all three arrow.]\n:Sign: Point B\n:Label: Chicks \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Electric skateboard]]"
