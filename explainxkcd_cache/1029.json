I'm converting to Judaism.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall]] attempts to draw a {{w|five-pointed star}}; the <s>easiest</s> traditional way to do this free-hand is by drawing a {{w|pentagram}}, the simplest regular star figure in geometry. Once you've seen it done, you can usually draw a pentagram in one continuous motion. Unfortunately, while drawing the star Randall gets self-conscious and messes up, similar to how many attempts to draw the star go, especially when trying to remember how.\n\nThe correct way to draw a pentagram is to start like the first two panels, draw a line from the top point to the left leg, then from the left leg to the right arm. However, instead of drawing the next line upwards as Randall did, you need to draw it parallel to the \"ground\". After that, you go down to the right leg, then finish off with the top point.\n\nIn the title text, Randall takes the most extreme reaction to the problem by converting to {{w|Judaism}} just so he can use its {{w|Star of David| six-pointed star}} symbol, which he hopes is easier to draw because it is composed of two {{w|equilateral triangle}}s. This is completely absurd, as no sane human would change their entire religious beliefs just so they could more easily draw a star. {{Citation needed}}\n\nA series of similar failed attempts at drawing a five-pointed star can later be seen in the inside cover of some editions of Randall's book, [[What If? (book)|What If?]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:HOW TO DRAW A STAR:\n:[A slightly curved line is drawn, starting with a point near the top center of the panel, and going downward and to the left at approximately a 23-degree angle, with an arrow at the end.]\n\n:[Another slightly curved line goes up and to the right, creating a 34-degree angle with the first line.]\n:So far so good...\n\n:[A third line goes up and to the left, creating a 58-degree angle with the last line. The drawing now sort of resembles a tent being blown over in the wind.]\n:Steady as she goes...\n\n:[The fourth line goes down and to the right, creating an approximately 47-degree angle with the last line, and our star is beginning to look a bit askew.]\n:...uh oh.\n\n:''Shitshitshit''\n\n:[The fifth line comes up at a 48-degree angle, completely missing the first point by a mile, and our star has failed spectacularly.]\n:''ABORT!''\n:''ABORT!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]"
