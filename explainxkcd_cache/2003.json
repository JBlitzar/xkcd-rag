The {{w|Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947}} revised the presidential order of succession to its current order. This Act, though never challenged in the courts, may not be constitutional for two reasons. First, the Act names two members of Congress as successors. There are fundamental questions as to whether this violates the principle of Separation of Powers. The second issue is that the Act allows for anyone skipped over for succession to later assume the office if circumstances change to allow them to hold it. This would mean that the person in question could effectively unseat a sitting President, which raises serious constitutional issues. \n\nThere are also practical concerns regarding the Act. The line of succession includes all members of the Cabinet in the order that their department was established, with the oldest departments first. No consideration is given to which departments would be most relevant to the Presidency, particularly considering that this type of succession would presumably involve a serious crisis, which the new president would need to be able to address immediately. The Department of Homeland Security is in charge of the security and protection of the United States and its citizens and would probably already be privy to sensitive intelligence and briefings related to national security, but because it is the latest of the Departments to have been established (in 2003), the Secretary of Homeland Security is last in the current Presidential line of succession, behind Secretaries in much less sensitive roles, such as those of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Education. Another concern is that, by including members of Congress immediately after the Vice President, there is a serious risk that the simultaneous death of the President and Vice President could cause the Presidency to change to the opposing party, which could lead to serious political instability at the precise moment when the country is facing a national crisis. It even presents the possibility that simultaneous assassinations of the President and Vice President could function as an effective coup, shifting power to their opponents. \n\nFinally, there is the issue that, usually, everyone in the line of succession lives and works in Washington D.C. Hence, a sufficiently destructive attack or natural disaster impacting the city could realistically incapacitate all of them, leaving the USA leaderless at a time of extreme crisis. It is already established practice in the USA that everyone in this line not gather together at once. In cases where most senior government officials gather (such as the {{w| State of the Union}}), at least one member of the line of succession (referred to as the \"designated survivor\") is secured off-site, and would assume the presidency in the unlikely event that a {{w| mass casualty event}} were to kill or incapacitate everyone else in the line. However, disasters impacting an entire city remain a possibility, and no provision is made for them in current law.\n\nTo correct these issues, a think tank known as the {{w| Continuity of Government Commission}} prepared a report recommending a new line of succession, which would not include members of Congress, would reorder the cabinet secretaries so that the most suitable roles would be the first successors, and would include people who do not live or work in Washington DC. The full text of their report can be found [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06_continuity_of_government.pdf here]. A short, readable summary, including the report's recommended new line of succession, is [https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-continuity-of-the-presidency-the-second-report-of-the-continuity-of-government-commission here]. \n\nThe first six members of the commission's list are taken from the current line of succession, though the order is changed; they propose that after this, five new people should be appointed specifically for the purpose of assuming the presidency, if needed. Randall's list begins with these eleven people (combining the five new appointees into #7); afterwards, his list becomes increasingly comical and ridiculous.\n\nRandall's list omits members of Congress, as well as other cabinet positions, in accordance with the report's concerns about constitutionality and qualifications. However, his other additions totally ignore these issues, including people with no apparent qualifications for the office (such as actors, athletes, and competitive eaters) and people who are constitutionally ineligible for the office. The US Constitution requires that the President of the United States must be a natural-born US citizen, at least 35 years of age, and have resided in the US for at least fourteen years. Randall's list includes many people who don't meet these requirements. Most notably, he includes the entire succession to the British crown, almost none of whom meet the requirement of being natural-born citizens of the United States.\n\nIt may be expected that many of the athletes, musicians and actors on this list are likely to be ineligible as well. Most professional athletes in the relevant sports are under 35 years old, particularly those at the peak of their careers (when they'd likely win MVP awards), the most popular musicians also tend to be younger than 35, and many who meet these requirements were not born US citizens (and some many not even reside in the US). However, the existing line of succession can also contain ineligible people, who would simply be skipped over for succession. For example, at the comic's publication, {{w|Elaine Chao}} was the Secretary of Transportation and would normally be 14th in line, but because she is a naturalized citizen of the US, rather than native-born (she was born in Taiwan) she would not qualify for the office if the line came to her. The presidential line of succession was first mentioned in [[1933: Santa Facts]].\n\nThe title text mentions that ties will be broken by whoever was closest to the surface of {{w|Europa}} when they were born. Europa is a moon of Jupiter and one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for {{w|Habitability of natural satellites|potential habitability}}. This is likely a parody of systems in which ties are broken by semi-arbitrary rules (such as the older candidate automatically winning a tie) or a randomized ones (such as ties being decided by a coin flip). The position of Europa with respect to Earth at the time of one's birth depends on enough factors that it acts as a pseudo-random tie breaker, albeit a needlessly complicated one.\n\n==Order of succession==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!#\n!Randall's order\n!Current order by the 1947 Act\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|{{w|POTUS|President}}\n|President\n|Not generally considered part of the line of succession, as incumbents cannot \"succeed\" to their own post. (This should really be item 0 on the list.)\n|-\n|2\n|{{w|POTUS|Vice president}}\n|Vice president\n|This is the same as in the actual line of succession. Succeeding the President is one of the only two roles assigned to the Vice President by the Constitution, the other being presiding over the Senate (including breaking ties), but Vice Presidents are often given additional roles during office.\n|-\n|3\n|{{w|United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State}}\n|Speaker of the House of Representatives\n|Moved up from 5th position. This is likely a serious suggestion. As mentioned above, the existing Succession Act includes the Speaker of the House and President Pro Tempore of the Senate, which presents serious practical and constitutional issues. The Secretary of State is the chief officer responsible for the country's international relations and diplomatic missions, and would be a logical successor, particularly in times of crisis. \n|-\n|4\n|{{w|United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense}}\n|{{w|President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate}}\n|Moved up from 7th position. Also likely a serious suggestion. The existing succession places the Secretary of Defense behind the Secretary of the Treasury in succession. If the three preceding officials were simultaneously killed or incapacitated, there would be a high likelihood that the country was under attack, and other powers could easily try to take advantage of any power vacuum. Since the Secretary of Defense is most connected to the nation's military, and most in tune with information regarding potential threats and risks, this would be a logical succession.\n|-\n|5\n|{{w|United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security}}\n|Secretary of State\n|Moved up from 19th position. Again likely a serious suggestion. As with the Secretary of Defense, this officer would likely be closely aligned with the national emergency response infrastructure (including overseeing the {{w|Federal Emergency Management Agency}}), and would be well equipped to deal with a major attack or natural disaster. \n|-\n|6\n|{{w|United States Attorney General|Attorney General}}\n|{{w|United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury}}\t\n|Moved up from 8th position. Once again, likely a serious suggestion. The Attorney General oversees national law enforcement, and would be in a position to deal with internal chaos that could result from a disaster that impacted the federal government so deeply. \n|-\n|7\n|Five people who do not live in {{w|Washington, D.C.}}, nominated at the start of the President's term and confirmed by the Senate\n|Secretary of Defense\n|Washington, D.C is the capital of the United States, and is where the {{w|White House}}, the President's residence, is located. Presumably this provision covers the case where much of the government, including positions 1–6 here, are killed by a natural disaster or attack in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis suggestion establishes no qualifications for these people, but the fact that they'd need to be confirmed by the Senate suggests that they would be chosen to be competent for the role. It is also unclear if an order is determined among these five or if they take up a joint presidency. This suggestion is taken from the Second Report of the Continuity of Government Commission to prevent the danger of the entire line of succession being removed in a single event. \n|-\n|8\n|{{w|Tom Hanks}}\n|Attorney General\n|Academy Award-winning American actor. This is the first unambiguously unserious suggestion.{{Citation needed}} Tom Hanks is very popular and considered exceptionally likeable by many Americans, but has never served in public office or displayed any particular affinity for politics. The implication is that Mr. Hanks would be easily accepted as a leader, based solely on his personal charm. It should also be noticed that Tom Hanks played Jim Lovell, who served in the navy before becoming an astronaut (Many early astronauts were former military members.), in ''Apollo 13'', a military captain in ''Saving Private Ryan'', a prison officer in ''The Green Mile'', a naval intelligence officer in ''James B. Donovan'', and a member of the House of Representatives in ''Charlie Wilson's War''; if Tom Hanks's appearances in movies counted as real-life experience, then he would be adequately qualified.\n|-\n|9\n|State Governors, in descending order of state population at last census\n|{{w|United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior}}\n|Also taken from Second Report of the Continuity of Government Commission. At the time of publication, the last {{w|United States Census}} was the 2010 Census. As California is the most populous state, its Governor ({{w|Jerry Brown}} at the time of publication) would have been first in line. \n\nSee also the {{w|2010_United_States_Census#State_rankings|state population rankings}} and the {{w|list of current United States governors}}. As worded, this criterion would exclude territorial governors (and the Mayor of Washington, D.C.).\n|-\n|10\n|Anyone who won an Oscar for playing a governor\n|{{w|United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture}}\n|Oscars, or {{w|Academy Awards}}, are annual film awards awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. At the time of publication, the only Oscar awarded for playing a governor was {{w|Broderick Crawford}}'s 1949 Best Actor award for the fictional Willie Stark in ''{{w|All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men}}'' (a character based on {{w|Huey Long}}). However, Crawford died in 1986, so would be unable to serve as President.\n\nThis may be a reference to the {{w|Political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger}}: a highly-lauded actor who became governor of California, but did not win an Oscar or play a governor before being elected. (As a naturalized citizen, he is also ineligible for the Presidency.)\nThere is also humor in suggesting that playing a governor delivers just as much experience as being a governor. (Something similar was mentioned in the section about Tom Hanks, who played, among other things, a member of the House of Representatives.)\n|-\n|11\n|Anyone who won a Governor's award for playing someone named Oscar\n|{{w|United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce}}\t\n|The {{w|Governors Awards}} are an annual award ceremony hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to present lifetime achievement awards within the film industry. As this award is a lifetime achievement award, it does not seem possible that an actor could win this award for simply playing someone named Oscar. Notwithstanding the nature of the award, at the time of publication, no recipient of a Governors Award has played a character named Oscar.\n\nObviously, the joke is that changing the order of the words from the previous proposal produces something that could actually exist.\n|-\n|12\n|{{w|Kate McKinnon}}, if available\n|Secretary of Labor\n|Comedic actress famous for being a cast member on {{w|Saturday Night Live}}. She is known for her character work and celebrity impressions. She has recently done impersonations of members of the Trump administration including Spokeswoman {{w|Kellyanne Conway}} and Attorney General {{w|Jeff Sessions}}. She also played {{w|Hillary Clinton}} during the 2016 campaign and presumably would have played her when she was President had she won; but since Clinton lost, McKinnon has not actually played a President. At the time the comic was released, she was 34 years 5 months old; thus she was not \"available\" until seven months later. Being available could also refer to not already having an acting commitment, in which case the comic would be humorously implying that fulfilling her acting roles is more important than the country having leadership.\n|-\n|13\n|Billboard Year-End Hot 100 Singles artists #1 through #10 (for groups, whoever is credited first in name, liner notes, etc)\n|Secretary of Health and Human Services\t\n|The {{w|Billboard Hot 100}} is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for singles, published weekly by Billboard magazine. The weekly data is aggregated into a cumulative {{w|Billboard Year-End}} (based on a \"year\" that ends the third week of November, in order to meet December publication deadlines). At the time of publication, the most recent such list was the {{w|Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2017}}.\n\nBased on that list, the artists considered for the presidential succession would be: {{w|Ed Sheeran}}, {{w|Luis Fonsi}}, {{w|Bruno Mars}}, {{w|Kendrick Lamar}}, Alex Pall (of {{w|The Chainsmokers}}), {{w|Quavo|Quavoius Keyate Marshall}} (of {{w|Migos}}), {{w|Sam Hunt}}, {{w|Dan Reynolds}} (of {{w|Imagine Dragons}}), and {{w|Post Malone}}. There are only nine names instead of ten because The Chainsmokers had two of the top 10 singles in 2017. Of these, only Luis Fonsi (40 years old, born in Puerto Rico) was legally eligible for the office; all the others were too young, and Sheeran is additionally from the United Kingdom.\n|-\n|14\n|The top 5 US astronauts in descending order of total spaceflight time\n|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\t\n|Astronauts are highly respected and rigorously selected, but most have little involvement in politics. According to [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-station-astronaut-record-holders NASA], the top 5 US astronauts by cumulative space time at the time of publication were: {{w|Peggy Whitson}}, {{w|Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams}}, {{W|Scott Kelly (astronaut)|Scott Kelly}} (whose brother {{w|Mark Kelley (astronaut)|Mark}} is a sitting US Senator), {{w|Mike Fincke}}, and {{w|Mike Foale}}. However, it is unclear whether Foale would qualify as a natural-born citizen, as he was born in the United Kingdom to a British father and American mother.\n|-\n|15\n|{{w|Serena Williams}} (or, if she lost her most recent match, whoever beat her)\n|Secretary of Transportation\n|As of the time of publication, Serena Williams was a top female tennis player. She is arguably the greatest female tennis player of all-time, winning 39 {{w|Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam}} titles, including 23 women's singles titles. At the time of publication Serena Williams did win her most recent match (2018 French Open, third round, on June 2nd), although she withdrew from her next match against Maria Sharapova (which perhaps should count as a loss, especially if she withdrew in order to preserve her place in the line of succession and killed everyone in place ahead of her).\n\nIf her most recent defeat was to a non-US player, presumably she would be skipped over in line although this is not explicitly stated (the current succession list skips over anyone who would not normally qualify for not being a natural-born US citizen).\n|-\n|16\n|The most recent season NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL MVPs\n|Secretary of Energy\n|MVP stands for {{w|Most Valuable Player}}. The 4 listed leagues are the major sports leagues in the United States, the {{w|National Basketball Association}} (NBA), the {{w|National Football League}} (NFL), {{w|Major League Baseball}} (MLB), and the {{w|National Hockey League}} (NHL). We're assuming that Randall meant the regular season MVPs of each league, as each league also awards MVPs for their respective championships (or in the case of the NHL's {{w|Conn Smythe Trophy}}, their entire playoffs).\n\nAs of the time of publication, the most recent MVPs for the listed sports were {{w|Russell Westbrook}} (NBA), {{w|Tom Brady}} (NFL), {{w|José Altuve}} and {{w|Giancarlo Stanton}} (MLB has two, one for the American League and one for the National League), and {{w|Connor McDavid}} (NHL). Of these, only Brady would qualify for the list - Altuve and McDavid are Venezuelan and Canadian citizens respectively, and Westbrook (29) and Stanton (28) were too young.\n|-\n|17\n|{{w|Bill Pullman}} and his descendants by absolute primogeniture\n|Secretary of Education\t\n|American actor, known for playing President Thomas J. Whitmore in the 1996 film ''{{w|Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day}}''. \n\nAbsolute primogeniture is a form of succession where the oldest direct descendant regardless of gender receives the title. This is contrasted to {{w|Male-preference primogeniture}}, in which males come before females in the order of the throne, whether the males were born first or not. This may be a reference to the British law {{w|Succession to the Crown Act 2013}}, which changed the order of the throne from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. This act allows {{w|Princess Charlotte of Cambridge|Princess Charlotte}} to retain her place in line before {{w|Prince Louis of Cambridge|Prince Louis}}. \n\nAt the time of publication, Pullman's immediate descendants consisted of three children, with Maesa Pullman being the oldest at age 29. Thus all but Bill Pullman himself were too young for the presidency.\n|-\n|18\n|The entire line of succession to the British throne\n|Secretary of Veterans Affairs\t\n|According to the Constitution, only a natural-born citizen of the United States can become President, which means that at least most of the line of succession to the British throne is ineligible. However, it is possible that someone in the line of succession to the British throne either is a dual citizen or is not British (a person from outside of Britain or Ireland can become King; for example, some, including George I, were from what is now Germany). \n\nThe first 59 names on the list are {{w|Succession_to_the_British_throne#Current_line_of_succession|here}}. [https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/?date=2018-06-06 British Line of Succession on 6 June 2018] shows the list as it was at the comic's publication. American citizens [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-11/news/vw-42233_1_royal-house have, at times] been on the list, but no natural-born Americans were on the list when the comic was published. However, after this comic was published {{w|Archie Mountbatten-Windsor}} was born on May 6, 2019; he is currently seventh in the line of succession to the British throne and has US citizenship through his mother {{w|Meghan, Duchess of Sussex}}. As with Mark Foale, though, whether that qualifies as natural-born has not be tested (leaving aside his age and the fact that many royals in his position have historically relinquished their birthright US citizenship voluntarily, which he may choose to do once he reaches age 16). In theory, the full British succession list includes [http://www.wargs.com/essays/succession/2011.html several thousand people] (living descendants of {{w|Sophia of Hanover}} who are not Roman Catholic or otherwise disqualified), and it is possible that one or more such people would also be eligible to be President of the United States beyond Master Archie. Archie's sister Lillibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born in Santa Barbara, California, USA, on June 4, 2021, making her definitively a natural born US citizen, and thus, theoretically eligible to become US president upon turning 35.\n\nThe humor here derives from the fact that the United States was established by declaring independence from the United Kingdom, with rejection of the British monarchy being a basic founding principle, and a core principle of US governance. To appoint the British monarchy to the American presidency would contradict the basic goals of American independence. Alternatively, it may reference the recent wedding of {{w|Prince Harry}} to {{w|Meghan Markle}}, although she is not in the order of succession. A similar sequence of events was the plotline of the comedy film ''{{w|King Ralph}}'', which saw an American become the British monarch after the death of the royal family.\n|-\n|19\n|The current champion of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest\n|Secretary of Homeland Security\n|The {{w|Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest}} is an annual American hot dog competitive eating competition sponsored by {{w|Nathan's Famous}} held on July 4th. As of the time of publication, the most recent men's winner was {{w|Joey Chestnut}} and the women's winner was {{w|Miki Sudo}}. At the time of publication, neither was old enough to assume the office.\n\nThe comic does not specify whether the men's or women's winner should take office, creating a tie that would be broken by distance from Europa at birth. Had they both been eligible, [https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/29132/was-earth-closer-to-europa-on-1983-11-25-or-1985-07-22 Sudo would have won] by between 0.125 and 2.2 {{w|Astronomical unit}}s.\n|-\n|20\n|All other US citizens, chosen by a 29-round single-elimination Jousting tournament\n|''None''\n|Effective for a population up to 536,870,912 individuals (2^29) which would be enough to cover the entire US population (estimated at around 325 million at time of publication), although additional rounds can be added should the population grow further.\n\nThis is probably a reference to the {{w|Matter of Britain}} (e.g., {{w|The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone}}), where, after the death of Uther Pendragon, with no known successor to the throne of Britain (some versions of the legend refer incorrectly to England) for years, it is decided that the winner of a jousting tournament shall be crowned. However, Arthur, the Wart, pulls the Sword from the Stone.\n|}\n\n===List of specific individuals===\nBased on the comic's defined criteria for the order of succession, these are the specific individuals in that order, including only people who are otherwise eligible to be the President of United States (35 year old and natural born US citizens who lived in US for last 14 years) '''as of the date the comic was published'''. \n#[[Donald Trump]] ({{w|President of the United States}})\n#{{w|Mike Pence}} ({{w|Vice President of the United States}})\n#{{w|Mike Pompeo}} ({{w|United States Secretary of State}})\n#{{w|Jim Mattis}} ({{w|United States Secretary of Defense}})\n#{{w|Kirstjen Nielsen}} ({{w|United States Secretary of Homeland Security}})\n#{{w|Jeff Sessions}} ({{w|United States Attorney General}})\n#*''As Donald Trump did not appoint anyone to fill position #7 on Randall's line of succession, Hanks immediately followed after Sessions.''\n#{{w|Tom Hanks}} (Tom Hanks) \n#{{w|Jerry Brown}} (Governor of California)\n#{{w|Greg Abbott}} (Governor of Texas)\n#{{w|Andrew Cuomo}} (Governor of New York)\n#{{w|Rick Scott}} (Governor of Florida)\n#{{w|Bruce Rauner}} (Governor of Illinois)\n#{{w|Tom Wolf}} (Governor of Pennsylvania)\n#{{w|John Kasich}} (Governor of Ohio)\n#{{w|Rick Snyder}} (Governor of Michigan)\n#{{w|Nathan Deal}} (Governor of Georgia)\n#{{w|Roy Cooper}} (Governor of North Carolina)\n#{{w|Phil Murphy}} (Governor of New Jersey)\n#{{w|Ralph Northam}} (Governor of Virginia)\n#{{w|Jay Inslee}} (Governor of Washington)\n#{{w|Charlie Baker}} (Governor of Massachusetts)\n#{{w|Eric Holcomb}} (Governor of Indiana)\n#{{w|Doug Ducey}} (Governor of Arizona)\n#{{w|Bill Haslam}} (Governor of Tennessee)\n#{{w|Mike Parson}} (Governor of Missouri)\n#{{w|Larry Hogan}} (Governor of Maryland)\n#{{w|Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker}} (Governor of Wisconsin)\n#{{w|Mark Dayton}} (Governor of Minnesota)\n#{{w|John Hickenlooper}} (Governor of Colorado)\n#{{w|Kay Ivey}} (Governor of Alabama)\n#{{w|Henry McMaster}} (Governor of South Carolina)\n#{{w|John Bel Edwards}} (Governor of Louisiana)\n#{{w|Matt Bevin}} (Governor of Kentucky)\n#{{w|Kate Brown}} (Governor of Oregon)<br/>''Born in Spain to a member of the US Air Force, should be considered a natural-born citizen until proven otherwise.''\n#{{w|Mary Fallin}} (Governor of Oklahoma)\n#{{w|Dannel Malloy}} (Governor of Connecticut)\n#{{w|Kim Reynolds}} (Governor of Iowa)\n#{{w|Phil Bryant}} (Governor of Mississippi)\n#{{w|Asa Hutchinson}} (Governor of Arkansas)\n#{{w|Jeff Colyer}} (Governor of Kansas)\n#{{w|Gary Herbert}} (Governor of Utah)\n#{{w|Brian Sandoval}} (Governor of Nevada)\n#{{w|Susana Martinez}} (Governor of New Mexico)\n#{{w|Jim Justice}} (Governor of West Virginia)\n#{{w|Pete Ricketts}} (Governor of Nebraska)\n#{{w|Butch Otter}} (Governor of Idaho)\n#{{w|David Ige}} (Governor of Hawaii)\n#{{w|Paul LePage}} (Governor of Maine)\n#{{w|Chris Sununu}} (Governor of New Hampshire)\n#{{w|Gina Raimondo}} (Governor of Rhode Island)\n#{{w|Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock}} (Governor of Montana)\n#{{w|John Carney (politician)|John Carney}} (Governor of Delaware)\n#{{w|Dennis Daugaard}} (Governor of South Dakota)\n#{{w|Bill Walker (U.S. politician)|Bill Walker}} (Governor of Alaska)\n#{{w|Doug Burgum}} (Governor of North Dakota)\n#{{w|Phil Scott (politician)|Phil Scott}} (Governor of Vermont)\n#{{w|Matt Mead}} (Governor of Wyoming)\n#*''Entries 10 and 11 on Randall's list had no eligible living members.''\n#*''Kate McKinnon was only 34 years 5 months old at the time the comic was released, making her ineligible at that time.''\n#{{w|Luis Fonsi}} (Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2017, #2 artist)<br/>''Fonsi was the only eligible individual under the Billboard criterion.''\n#{{w|Peggy Whitson}} (Astronaut, 665 days in space)\n#{{w|Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams}} (Astronaut, 534 days in space)\n#{{w|Scott Kelly}} (Astronaut, 520 days in space)\n#{{w|Mike Fincke}} (Astronaut, 382 days in space)\n#{{w|Mike Foale}} (Astronaut, 374 days in space)<br>''Foale was born in the UK but his mother is an American, and he holds dual citizenship with both countries.
