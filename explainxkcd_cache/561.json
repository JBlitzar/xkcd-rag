And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth. Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic would later be followed by [[568: Well 2]]. Uncomfortable truths are truths that exist, but no one wants to have to think about them. The first is about ''{{w|Firefly (TV Series)|Firefly}}'', the TV series created by {{w|Joss Whedon}} and canceled by {{w|FOX}}, due to poor ratings performance, after {{tvtropes|OutOfOrder|airing the first 13 episodes out-of-order}}. In ''Firefly'', the main languages spoken are English and Chinese (supposedly in equal measure), because China was the only other world power besides America to go to space (Joss Whedon's own explanation on the DVDs). However, there are {{tvtropes|HumansAreWhite|very few actual Asians}} on-screen.\n\nThe second is about two different keyboard layouts, QWERTY and Dvorak. Early {{w|typewriter}}s used to jam easily if two nearby keys were struck at about the same time. To work around this, the {{w|QWERTY}} layout, named after the first six letters on its keys, scattered common letter combinations around the keyboard, thus greatly avoiding the problem. Later typewriter mechanisms were less prone to jamming, which prompted a few people to try to create alternative layouts, such as {{w|Blickensderfer typewriter|Blickensderfer's DHIATENSOR layout}} in 1892, or the {{w|Dvorak Simplified Keyboard}} in 1932. Such layouts never really caught on; by then, typists were all very used to the QWERTY layout, and were unwilling to take the time and effort to learn a new one.\n\nIn the Dvorak layout, {{w|August Dvorak}} placed the most frequently used keys at the most easily accessible places; Dvorak's advocates claim this reduces typing effort and repetitive strain (as mentioned in the title text) while increasing typing speed and accuracy. However, rigorous, unbiased studies have yet to clearly show significant superiority. (As the title text mentions, the most commonly cited study in Dvorak's favor was overseen by Dvorak himself during his US Navy service in World War II.) This was the second comic to refer to Dvorak after [[554: Not Enough Work]], and since then it has become a [[:Category:Dvorak|recurrent theme]] on xkcd.\n\nThe third and fourth truths are connected: they involve the two people receiving them and (presumably) their relationship with each other. Every time [[Cueball]] said \"I love you\" he never really meant it; whereas [[Megan]] meant it every time she said \"I love you\". This is very uncomfortable for both! This could also be intentional, since in [[568: Well 2]], a person called Mike (who happens to be a friend of [[Megan]]), is actually hiding inside the well and tells these uncomfortable \"truths\", he would have intentionally broken Cueball and Megan up to be able to manipulate Megan in the next installment. In [[1608: Hoverboard]], there is also a well in the left part of the world. It has the same type of covered top and, at the bottom, there is a girl with a coin a coin, like the one thrown into a wishing well. Here are the [http://xkcd.com/1608/980:-1077+s.png top] and the [http://xkcd.com/1608/980:-1073+s.png bottom] of the well from [[1608: Hoverboard]].\n\nThe title text perpetuates the {{w|Editor war|Emacs vs. vi debate}}. Both {{w|Emacs}} and {{w|Vim (text editor)|Vim}} are text editors that are frequently used as general-language editors of source code. The issue is that, while Emacs is more user-friendly and customizable, vim is more lightweight while needing few keystrokes in text editing. Because of this balance, fans of Emacs and fans of vim end up fighting each other.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A sign sits by a well.]\n:The Uncomfortable Truths Well\n\n:[Cueball and Ponytail are lined up for the well; Cueball throws a coin in.]\n:Well: For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, Firefly sure doesn't have any Asians.\n\n:[The first Cueball is gone, a second Cueball and Megan arrives as a couple lining up behind Ponytail; Ponytail throws a coin in.]\n:Well: There's no solid evidence DVORAK's better than QWERTY. The standard histories are urban legends.\n\n:[Just the couple remain; the second Cueball throws another coin in.]\n:Well: You've never said \"I love you\" and meant it. It was always just words.\n\n:[Megan has presumably also thrown a coin in the well. This is not shown as for the first three. Cueball waits for her on the other side of the well.]\n:Well: You meant it every time.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Dvorak]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Firefly]]\n[[Category:Emacs]]\n[[Category:The Uncomfortable Truths Well]]"
