Please.\n}}\n\nThis was the second comic [[LiveJournal|originally posted to LiveJournal]]. The previous one was [[7: Girl sleeping (Sketch -- 11th grade Spanish class)]], and the next one was [[3: Island (sketch)]]. It was among the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen comics]] posted to LiveJournal within 12 minutes on September 30, 2005, on the first day of the xkcd LiveJournal account.\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Flipped sketch.jpg|thumb|400px|Flipped sketch]]\nLike many early comics, this comic does not present a particular point, it's just a picture drawn by Randall. The sketch, when flipped vertically, maintains the appearance of having the sea on the bottom and sky on top, although the setting sun is on the wrong part of the horizon. Similar to {{w|Relativity (M. C. Escher) | works of M. C. Escher}}, this picture takes visual components of a typical scene and combines then in ways that appear to work well on a small scale, but would never combine that way in real life and do not make sense in the larger context of the image. The clouds are casting shadows on the sky.\n\nIn the title text, Randall jokes that there is a river flowing through the ocean, referring to the illusion he created in the sketch. The lighter part in the center of the drawing appears to be the Sun's reflection off a body of water, thus indicating that this feature is ocean, yet the forked and meandering line features to the left look like a river system flowing through the very same landscape. The similar but more singular line to the right could be coastline, one side water, the other land but, because of the conflicting interpretations, it doesn't make much sense to identify the central/foreground surface as either land or sea.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A sketch of a landscape with sun on the horizon.]\n:[There is text from the checkered paper at the top:]\n:From Page No.__\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 02]]\n[[Category:First day on LiveJournal| 02]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Sketches]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
