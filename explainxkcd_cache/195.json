(The {{w|Hilbert curve}} is used: the pattern is demonstrated at the bottom of the image.) In February 2011, the final remaining IPv4 blocks were allocated to the {{w|Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet registries}}, and so today there would no longer be any green spaces outside of Class E addresses (above 240 through 255, excluding the Broadcast address of 255.255.255.255).\n\nIn the early 1990s, corporations and governments could register an entire {{w|Classful network|class A}} segment (one 256th of the total space), but later it was divided into smaller parts because of a lack of space.\n\nThis leads to the title text, which mentions {{w|IPv6}}. This protocol has so many addresses that only a [[865: Nanobots|swarm of nanobots]] could exhaust them. The default desktop picture in Windows XP is a green landscape, and the joke is that since barely any of the addresses are allocated yet, the IPv6 map would just be a green landscape. There are large ([https://observablehq.com/@vasturiano/hilbert-map-of-ipv6-address-space enough to be visible]) blocks of IPv6 space that have been allocated for special purposes and to RIRs. However, the amount of IPv6 space allocated to end users is only a tiny portion of that.\n\nLater, Randall actually drew some \"real\" maps of the Internet, or at least its online Communities (see [[256: Online Communities]] and [[802: Online Communities 2]]).\n\nA large number of updated Hilbert curve maps inspired by this comic have been created. Many also use data obtained by {{w|Ping_(networking_utility)|pinging}} IP addresses to see which addresses are accessible. Here are maps with images from [https://www.caida.org/archive/id-consumption/census-map/ 2003-2006], [https://iepg.org/2007-12-ietf70/3dheatmaps.pdf 2007] (which has a few different maps), [https://corte.si/geohilbert/index.html 2009] (showing country codes), [https://ant.isi.edu/address/index.html 2010], [https://census2012.sourceforge.net/hilbert.html 2012] (collected by the Carna Botnet), a [https://ant.isi.edu/address/census_2006_2014.html 2006-2014 animation], [https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/scan-ping-the-internet-hilbert-curve 2018], and [https://observablehq.com/@vasturiano/hilbert-map-of-ipv4-address-space 2023].\n\n==Transcript==\n:Map of the Internet The IPv4 Space, 2006 This chart shows the IP address space on a plane using a fractal mapping which preserves grouping--any consecutive string of IPs will translate to a single, compact, contiguous region on the map. Each of the 256 numbered blocks represents one  8 subnet (containing all IPs that start with that number).  The upper left section shows the blocks sold directly to corporations and goverments in the 1990's before the RIRs took over allocation.\n:Diagram showing IP ownership:\n:0: Local\n:1-2: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:3: General Electric\n:4: BB&N INC\n:5: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:6: Army AISC\n:7: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:8: BB&N INC\n:9: IBM\n:10: VPNs\n:11: DoD Intel\n:12: Bell Labs\n:13: Xerox\n:14: Public data nets\n:15: HP\n:16: DEC\n:17: Apple\n:18: MIT\n:19: Ford\n:20: CSC\n:21: DDN-RYN\n:22: DISA\n:23: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:24: Cable TV\n:25: UK MoD\n:26: DISA\n:27: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:28: DSI\n:29-30: DISA\n:31: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:32: NORSK\n:33: DLA\n:34: Halliburton\n:35: Merit\n:36-37: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:38: PSI\n:39: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:40: Eli Lily\n:41: ARINIC\n:42: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:43: Japan INET\n:44: HAM Radio\n:45: INTEROP\n:46: BB&N INC\n:47: Bell North\n:48: Prudential\n:49-50: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:51: UK Social Security\n:52: duPont\n:55: Boeing\n:56: USPS\n:57: SITA\n:58-61: Asia-Pacific\n:62: Europe\n:63-76: USA & Canada (contains: UUNET, Google, Digg, Slashdot, Ebay, Craigslist, XKCD,<!-- sic --> Flickr)\n:77-79: Europe (unused)\n:80-91: Europe\n:92-95: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:96-99: North America\n:100-120: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:121-125: Asia-Pacific\n:126: Japan\n:127: Loopback\n:128-132: Various Registrars\n:133: Japan\n:134-172: Various Registrars\n:173-189: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:188: Various\n:189-190: Latin America & Caribbean\n:191-192: Various (contains Private (RFC 1918))\n:193-195: Europe\n:196: Africa\n:197: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:198: US & Various\n:199: North America\n:200-201: Latin America & Caribbean\n:202-203: Asia-Pacific\n:204-209: North America (contains Suicide Girls, BoingBoing)\n:210-211: Asia-Pacific\n:212-213: Europe\n:214-215: U.S. Department of Defense\n:216: North America (Contains Myspace, SomethingAwful)\n:217: Europe\n:218-222: Asia-Pacific\n:223: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n:224-239: Multicast\n:240-255: <font color=\"green\">Unallocated</font>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Maps]]"
