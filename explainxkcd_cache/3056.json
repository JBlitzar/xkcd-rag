In the 1960s, we had just started to understand the role of DNA; as the years progressed, we realized RNA played a part, initially as an intermediary; and it turned 'weird' as we learned that RNA's role is potentially as complex as DNA's, if not more so. People now believe that life as we know it developed as RNA, and then evolved proteins and DNA later; this is called the \"{{w|RNA World}}\" theory.\n<!-- Wondering if to gut the above, back to \"the general idea\" and do a table of \"milestones of understanding\" (both comic, and additional), but would take a lot more work to get right... -->\n\n*The first panel (1960s) shows the simplified (though incorrect) version of the {{w|central dogma}}, saying that RNA's sole function is to carry information from DNA to produce proteins.\n\n*The second panel (1980s) shows the discovery that RNA itself can also catalyze reactions, like in {{w|ribozymes}}.\n\n*The third panel (2000s) shows the more recent discovery of many different types of RNA that have numerous functions, like {{w|small interfering RNA|siRNA}} which acts in the {{w|RNA interference}} pathway, {{w|microRNA|miRNA}} which causes regulation of transcript expression, {{w|Piwi-interacting RNA|piRNA}} which regulates {{w|transposons}} and other genetic elements, and more.\n\n*The fourth panel (2020s) explains that RNA seems to be the primary actor in life, and it merely uses DNA for permanent storage of information. In particular, DNA contains the genetic information that's copied when cells divide and when ova and sperm combine. This seems to be a reference to the {{w|RNA-based evolution}} theory, which claims that RNA is the primary driver of evolution. It's similar to the idea that [https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/118413-a-hen-is-only-an-egg-s-way-of-making-another a hen is only an egg's way of making another egg].\n\n*The title text (2040s) [[605: Extrapolating|extrapolates]] the increasing significance of RNA to life. Specifically, that by the 2040s humans would discover that life evolved on Earth 5 distinct times, each with RNA forming its basis, essentially making RNA central to not just our tree of life, but the development of life in general. All types of life we know of today (or have evidence of having existed) seem highly likely to have arisen from the {{w|last universal common ancestor}}. However, detection of past or present [[2171: Shadow Biosphere|shadow biospheres]] could eventually provide evidence of alternative instances of the development of life on Earth.\n\nRNA has been mentioned previously in [[2425: mRNA Vaccine]], where the [[:Category:COVID-19 vaccine|COVID-19 vaccine]] is explained, and [[3002: RNAWorld]], in which Disney decides to capitalize on the success of RNA.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In each panel, Cueball is standing in front of a poster.
