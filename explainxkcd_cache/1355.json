Here, [[Randall]] suggests replacing the ad with some interesting facts. This would tell people who see the banner something new and interesting about the world, rather than try to sell them something. He presents two possible facts: {{w|Adriamycin}}, a cancer therapy, and {{w|Iry-Hor}}, the earliest human we know by name.\n\nThe {{w|chemotherapy}} drug {{w|doxorubicin}}, trade name Adriamycin, is based on a strain of the bacterium ''{{w|Streptomyces peucetius}}'', first isolated from a soil sample taken at {{w|Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte}} in {{w|Andria}}, Italy.\n\nAs mentioned at the title text {{w|Iry-Hor}} was an ancient, {{w|Dynasty 0|predynastic}} pharaoh of ancient Egypt â€” no earlier documents exist today. {{w|Kushim (Uruk Period)|Kushim}} is a contemporary contender.\n\nThis fact is also found in [[1732: Earth Temperature Timeline]], where it is placed at exactly 3100 BC (or {{w|BCE}}).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[There is a Cessna 172 with a banner behind.]\n:Banner: Adriamycin, one of our most potent chemotherapy drugs, comes from the dirt from an Italian castle.\n\n:[Caption beneath the panel]\n:<big>My hobby:</big> \n:Breaking into airplane hangars and replacing the ads on their giant banners with cool facts.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Cancer]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]\n[[Category:Airplane banner]]"
