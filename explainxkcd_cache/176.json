The second panel contains an eloquent prosaic description of an idyllic sunrise over an unfamiliar landscape analogizing the uncertainty and excitement of the life that lies ahead. This is designed to put the reader off-guard for the \"your mom\" stinger in the third panel.\n\n[[Cueball]] wants to settle down on his own, but every time when he tries, he still ends up at the reader's Mom's place (as is customary in such jokes). \n\nIn photography, the term {{w|Golden hour (photography)|Golden Hour}} is used to describe the hour after sunrise (and also the hour before sunset), due to the good lighting conditions at those times. In the title text, you could initially believe that Cueball is using these early morning trips to capture beautiful photographs of the scenery, until it turns out that in fact the photos were of the reader's Mom (and likely risque in nature).\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Every morning for a week now I've gone out driving before sunrise.\n:I wanted to get lost in the dark, park my car, listen to music, and sip from a warm drink as dawn broke around me, gradually revealing a landscape I'd never before seen. A chain of unique beginnings forcing wonder into the seeds of each day.\n:Cueball: But I guess I need more willpower, because each sunrise just found me at your mom's apartment again.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]\n[[Category:Photography]]"
