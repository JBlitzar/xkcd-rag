This comic summarizes all the data from such experiments, observing that given the data, it's very unlikely that supernatural powers actually exist.\n\nThe title text refers to a person who has claimed to have supernatural powers, and suggests that he might really have such powers. This invokes the fact that absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence, although there has never previously been a confirmed example of a person with superpowers. This does not prove that this is certainly impossible. However, the graph above suggests that, although not impossible, such an event would be highly unlikely. No matter how much evidence we collect, there is always some positive (but vanishingly small) chance that some person may hold supernatural powers.\n\nAlternatively, the title text explains that even though there is no reason to believe that anyone has any super powers, some people are always ready to believe the next one to claim so - very naive - and the exact opposite meaning of the one described above. Knowing [[Randall]]'s comic, this seems more likely. \n\nThe title itself may be a reference to the TV show {{w|Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural's}} recap segment, \"The Road So Far.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Bar graph titled \"Claims of Supernatural Powers\" and has two sets of data. The first data set is labeled \"Confirmed By Experiment\" and is empty. The second data set is \"Refuted By Experiment\" and goes to the top of the graph.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Bar charts]]\n[[Category:Paranormal]]"
