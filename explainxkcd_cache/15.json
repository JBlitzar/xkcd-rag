I mean, she has a dinosaur!<br>I'm gonna update this MWF for a while and see how that works.\n}}\n\nThis was the fourteenth comic [[LiveJournal|originally posted to LiveJournal]]. The previous one was [[11: Barrel - Part 2]], and the next one was [[16: Monty Python -- Enough]]. It was the first comic posted to LiveJournal after the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen xkcd comics]] were released.\n\n==Explanation==\nIn this comic, a person is riding a {{w|Brontosaurus}} (or what would [[:Category:Apatosaurus|later be referred to]] as an {{w|Apatosaurus}}). The humor lies in the fact that the person feels the need to highlight their peculiarity, despite the obvious oddity of riding an extinct and dangerous creature. [[Megan]] would later imagine riding an Apatosaurus in [[650: Nowhere]]. This dinosaur genus is also mentioned in [[460: Paleontology]] and [[636: Brontosaurus]]. This was the first comic to feature a dinosaur, but since then, there have been numerous [[:Category:Dinosaurs|comics about them]] on xkcd.\n\nThe title text further emphasizes this, while the original caption signifies that [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] would start posting a new comic every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Ironically enough, this comic was posted on a Sunday, a few minutes before Monday: see the [[#Trivia|trivia section]]. From now, he also began putting the date into most, but not all, comic titles on [[LiveJournal]] until he started to use [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] instead.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A person is standing on the back of a green dinosaur and holding reins to the dinosaur's head.]\n:Person: Before you talk to me, I should warn you: I am kind of strange\n\n==Trivia==\n*This was the first comic to be [[:Category:Sunday comics|released on a Sunday]]. It was released only 17 minutes before midnight at 11:43 PM.\n*The [https://xkcd.com/15/info.0.json official transcript] of this comic reads \"There is a ''man'' standing on top of a dinosaur\" despite the original LiveJournal caption stating the dinosaur rider is female.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 14]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Apatosaurus]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]"
