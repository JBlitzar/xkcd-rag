But even if they count, it takes ideal conditions and you might hurt your eyes.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is a reference to the myth that the {{w|Great Wall of China}} is the only man-made object that can be seen from the {{w|Moon}} (or from space) with the naked eye.  {{w|Great Wall of China#Visibility_from_space|Sadly, it cannot}}. In fact, it's barely visible from the orbit of low satellites. Not only that, even if it was visible from space, it wouldn't be alone with that title. There are {{w|Artificial structures visible from space|plenty of objects visible from space}}, the {{w|Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant}} is able to be seen from space, so are the clusters of greenhouses in Almería Spain.\n\nThis comic mocks the myth by conflating it with another saying about the Moon, and how the Moon's craters and valleys are visible to the naked human eye. Indeed, the Moon is the only {{w|Astronomical object|celestial body}} for which this is true, as all other bodies (with the potential exception of the Sun, see the title text) can only be seen as tiny points of light by the unaided human eye. There is nothing special about the Great Wall of China in this factoid, though; the Moon’s features can be seen equally well from practically any place on Earth with a view of the Moon.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text states that one is sometimes able to see large {{w|sunspots}} if any are present and conditions are ideal. However, looking directly at the sun with the naked eye risks extensive damage to the eye and should NEVER be done. It could, however, be possible to see them when the Sun is seen through a thin cloud cover or maybe at sunset/sunrise. (It's possible to see very large sunspots with {{w|solar eclipse}} {{w|Solar viewer|glasses}} or other adequate {{w|Eye protection#Protection against light|protection}}, but that's not unaided human eye.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is holding her arm up towards Ponytail as they stand atop a large brick wall with {{w|Merlon|merlons}} along the top. They are standing to the left of a tower with three small windows as well as merlons on the top.]\n:Megan: Did you know that the moon's craters and plains are the only structures on the surface of a celestial body that can be seen with the naked eye from the Great Wall of China?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category: Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category: Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category: Astronomy]]"
