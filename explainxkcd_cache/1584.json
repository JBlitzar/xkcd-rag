    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1584\n| date      = September 30, 2015\n| title     = Moments of Inspiration\n| image     = moments_of_inspiration.png\n| titletext = Charles, I just talked to John and Mildred, who run that company selling seeds and nuts, and their kids with MOUTHS are starving!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Isaac Newton}}'s original examples describing the {{w|Newton's law of universal gravitation|force of gravity}} show an apple falling from a tree in order to explain why the apple falls toward the Earth, instead of the Earth falling toward the apple. He is often said to have been inspired by watching {{w|Isaac_Newton#Apple_incident|falling apple}}s; in common folklore, this developed into the legend that he was actually ''struck'' by an apple. The first part of this comic retells that famous legend. The later panels depict similar (but more and more implausible) legends that could emerge if we were to assume that other scientists' most famous examples and discoveries were based on actually observing some mundane everyday event taking place.\n\nIn the first situation, we not only see the apple fall on Newton's head, we also see the Moon. This was one of the first astronomical objects on which he used his theory of gravity. He calculated its orbit around the Earth and found that it fit with the theory.\n\nIn the second situation, Cueball throws a baseball towards {{w|Lise Meitner}}, but when she fails to catch the ball it hits one of her porcelain model-atoms. In this way, Meitner discovered a way to split the atom. Cueball may represent {{w|Otto Hahn}}, since they were part of the Hahn-Meitner-Strassmann team that worked on this problem. Hahn was later awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, where Meitner was overlooked. Throwing something at someone and asking them to [http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/think-fast-throwing-something.1984437/ think fast] is a common \"joke\", where the receiver rarely has a chance to actually catch the object. But in this case, it could also be a reference to the fact that she then thought fast then made a major discovery. Or if it is Hahn, then he thought faster and got the award instead of her. The porcelain models might also be a reference to {{w|Meissen porcelain}}, in German called \"Meißner Porzellan\", where \"Meißner\" is phonetically very similar to \"Meitner\". Meitner has previously been mentioned in the comic [[896: Marie Curie]], which more or less explains why [[Randall]] did not choose the more famous {{w|Marie Curie}} as the female example in this comic. Meitner is not very well known in the public, compared to the three men or Curie, but this may exactly be the point for choosing her. She should have been just as famous considering what splitting the atom has {{w|Nuclear power|led}} {{w|Nuclear weapon|to}}. Also, there's not much in Marie's story that could be put down to fanciful anecdotes. \"All\" she did was extract a few chemicals and study their properties.\n\nIn the third situation, it is indicated that half of {{w|Charles Darwin}}'s children had {{w|beaks}}, a property not normally found in human children.{{Citation needed}} This would make it very difficult for them to drink soda from a glass or through a straw, compared to his normal children with mouths. Based on this observation he developed his ideas about natural selection and {{w|evolution}}. The comic is unclear on whether this makes them more or less fit to survive and reproduce. This is a reference to Darwin's initial findings on the {{w|HMS Beagle}} on how {{w|Galapagos}} {{w|finches}} with differently shaped beaks are better suited for specific types of food and therefore are better selected for in environments where those foods are available. The title text furthers this, see below. Darwin later in life feared that, having married his cousin, their {{w|consanguinity}} would increase the risk that {{w|Charles_Darwin#Children|his children}} would be born with birth defects (although he did not fear that they would be born with beaks). The difficulty caused by beaks when drinking liquids could be a reference to the Aesop's fable ''{{w|The Fox and the Stork}}''.\n\nIn the fourth situation {{w|Albert Einstein}} remarks to a man that it's annoying that the man's twin brother keeps flashing a light from a train when Einstein is trying to check his clock. He then comes to a sudden revelation. This references several of Einstein's (different — they make little sense together in this manner) thought experiments on {{w|special relativity}}, such as the {{w|twin paradox}} (the twin on the train should be younger after decelerating to a stop), a clock built from a beam of light, the {{w|time dilation}} experienced by the observer in the moving {{w|frame of reference}}, and the various constructs involving {{w|Einstein's thought experiments#Trains, embankments, and lightning flashes|trains and light(ning) flashes}} used to illustrate the {{w|relativity of simultaneity}}.\n\nThe title text shows that beaks rather than mouths are more useful for eating foods that have shells that need to be cracked open before eating like nuts and seeds. Here it is clear that in the John and Mildred family you starve if you cannot eat such foods, and thus it's an advantage for survival to have a beak instead of a normal mouth. \"John\" and \"Mildred\" may be Mildred and {{w|John T. Scopes}} of the famous 1925 \"{{w|Scopes Trial|monkey trial}}\" in which John was fined $100 for teaching evolution in a Tennessee school.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Isaac Newton, with curly long hair, sits under a tree. A waning crescent moon can be seen. An apple falls and hits him on the head. There is a caption in a frame that breaks the top border of the main frame:]\n:Isaac Newton\n:Apple falling: Bonk\n:Isaac Newton: ''Ow!''\n\n:[Isaac Newton rubs his sore head.]\n:Isaac Newton: Aha!\n\n:[Cueball throws a baseball towards Lise Meitner with short dark hair. (The ball can be seen in the next frame). She turns towards him too late to react and completely fails to even try catching the ball. There is a caption in a frame that breaks the top border of the main frame:]\n:Lise Meitner\n:Cueball: Hey Lise! Think fast!\n:Ball hitting something (off-screen): Crash\n\n:[Lise takes her hands to her mouth and she watches the broken porcelain atom lying in two pieces on the floor where it has fallen off a desk. On the desk, three other intact atoms can be seen. The baseball lies behind her.]\n:Lise Meitner: Oh no! My collection of porcelain atoms!\n:Lise Meitner:...Hmm.\n\n:[Four kids are standing in front of Megan and Charles Darwin (with a big beard and hair behind the ears). All the kids are trying to drink a glass of soda with a straw in them. The first kid is a boy with dark flat hair and sips soda through the straw with his mouth. The next kid is a boy with standing black hair, he tries in vain to drink with his beak open on each side of the glass. The third kid is a girl with her hair in a bun. She tries to get her beak into the glass which she has put on the floor. The last kid is a boy version of Cueball who slurps his soda through the straw. There is a caption in a frame that breaks the top border of the main frame:]\n:Charles Darwin\n:Megan: I gave our kids soda, but the ones with beaks always have trouble drinking it.\n:Charles Darwin: I've noticed that...\n:Boy with flat dark hair: Sip sip\n:Boy with standing black hair and a beak: Crunch\n:Girl with her hair in a bun and a beak: Peck peck\n:Cueball like kid: Sluurp\n\n:[A hairy guy is standing in front of Albert Einstein (with wild hair and a mustache), who is holding one hand to his head and has a clock in his other hand. Behind them is a train, with a locomotive at the front and a wagon behind that stretches beyond the frame. Another hairy guy has his head out of the front window of the wagon and is flashing a light towards the other two. In the next three windows can be seen passengers, two with Cueball like heads and one with hair. There is a caption in a frame that breaks the top border of the main frame:]\n:Albert Einstein\n:Albert Einstein: I wish your twin brother would stop shining lights at us from that train. I can barely see my clock!\n:Albert Einstein: ...Wait!\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic appeared on xkcd's ten-year anniversary.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
