In a handwritten text, the \"�\" symbol could then be mistaken for a censored word, signifying indignation against the person taking out the trash. This problem previously manifested as an \"I\" followed directly by the VS-16 \"emojify character\", turning them into an \" �\" without the \"A\".<ref>https://twitter.com/willkirkby/status/925865928193134593</ref> \n\nThe note in this comic is the equivalent of starting a text message with \"i took out...\" and triggering the iOS bug. The joke revolves around acceptance of the bug through repetition has influenced the writer's hand written style.\n\nThe codes in the title text refer to \"A �\" and \"! �\" respectively. The text provides a way to keep the \"bug\" active with the U+FFFD approximation, (which can be realized through the use of a {{w|Cydia}} tweak) even after it is patched. Although this would have no practical use, it is still a fun way{{Citation needed}} for iPhone users to keep the infamous bug fresh in everyone's mind, and to make sure that the Apple company never lives down the embarrassing incident.\n\nThe statement in the title text \"no update can never take this away from you\" is a {{w|Double negative|double negative}}, which is a considered non-standard grammatical use in modern English, although common in many dialects.  Taking literally it could actually mean \"any update can take this away from you\". This may be a typo or a colloquial use, with the intended meaning to be \"ever\" instead of \"never\" with some exaggeration.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A picture of a yellow post-it note with a handwritten message:]\n:A � took out the trash but the dishwasher still needs to be run.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Apple can try to fix the autocorrect bug, but I've already incorporated it into my handwriting.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Unicode]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
