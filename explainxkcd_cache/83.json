In this comic, [[Cueball]] uses the katamari as an analogy for his love for [[Megan]], pushing it to such embarrassing extremes that Megan feels the need to remark whether he could \"possibly get any gayer.\" At this point, Cueball wins the level he is playing and is transported by a \"Royal Rainbow,\" an in-game occurrence at the completion of each level. The rainbow is a symbol of gay pride, in addition to being just a generally happy (i.e. gay) idea.\n\nCueball also only takes up such a stand after Megan requests that he help her. This is possibly a criticism of male selfishness (perhaps Randall's self-criticism), in that males do not discuss romantic ideas, except as a way out.\n\nThe ''King of All Cosmos'', mentioned in the title text, is an instructive character in all of the Katamari games. The title text points out that perhaps we either like or love video games not because they are fun, but because they let us forget our problems and retreat into someone else or an intricate fantasy.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands on the left. Cueball is sitting on the floor with a game controller in his hand. He is looking at a TV on the floor connected to a game console, also on the floor.]\n:Megan: Can you pause for a moment and help me with something?\n:Cueball: You know, our love is like a katamari. We travel along, rolling up more and more of the world into our shared experience, taking it and making it our own.\n\n:Megan: I, you... wow. Geekiness aside, that was actually incredibly sweet.\n:Cueball: The clutter of everyday life, with a simple core to tie it together, eventually becomes something grand as the world itself.\n\n:[A rainbow extends outward from the TV, with \"ROYAL RAINBOW!\" above it. Cueball raises his hands in victory.]\n:Megan: Okay, also sweet, but now I'm wondering if you could possibly get any gayer.\n\n==Trivia==\n\nKatamari Damacy is also a subject of [[161: Accident]] and [[851: Na]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Katamari Damacy]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
