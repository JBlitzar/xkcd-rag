In the thought experiment, two chambers, both containing a gas at the same temperature, have a door between them. A being (later called a demon by {{w|Lord Kelvin}}) lets only fast-moving gas molecules move from the first chamber to the second, and only slow-moving ones move from the second chamber to the first. The second chamber's gas gradually warms as the average speed of its molecules increases, and the first chamber's gas likewise cools, apparently contradicting the second law. However, the actions of such a demon would use up at least the amount of energy that could later be extracted from having a gas separated into hot and cold parts, so such a demon could not gain energy and Maxwell's demon does not break the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is a fairly common theme in xkcd, last being mentioned in [[2848: Breaker Box]].\n\nThis demon behaves very differently from mythological {{w|demons}}, which exist in the afterlife (usually some form of {{w|hell}}) and punish evil humans after death by causing them great suffering (for example, by boiling them in oil or casting them into flame pits). [[Randall]] jokes that if Maxwell's demon were to encounter more stereotypical mythological ones, he would probably not fit in very well because of his very different approach, proposing treating humans like the particles of the thought experiment. While a few physics-savvy humans might feel offended by such treatment, real suffering could be caused by the anxiety of knowing that, once you choose to cross the door, you are not allowed to return ''for all eternity''. \n\nThe scientist Maxwell challenged traditional notions about physical phenomena by providing modern statistical explanations of \"large-scale effects\" such as temperature changes and modern infinitesimal explanations of \"distant effects\" such as electromagnetic forces. In a similar vein, Maxwell's demon in the comic challenges the mythological demons' traditional notion of torture by proposing modern psychological torture.\n\nThe title text continues the joke by suggesting that while Maxwell's demon's idea for torturing the souls of the damned might seem whimsical to the other demons, it could still be used to heat the flame pits better. The other demons' appreciation of this technical improvement mirrors real-life situations where kids that \"have trouble fitting in with the others\" due to their unusual ideas for games and atypical interests (e.g., in thermodynamics) occasionally earn some appreciation when their cleverness is found to be useful.\n\nThis comic was published on 1 November, 2024, the day after Halloween, around the time when many contemporary comic strips have demonic, supernatural or other spooky themes, as well as 4 days before the anniversary of Maxwell's passing (5th of November).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three demons, Cueball-like in general appearance but with horns and pointed tails, are standing together while surrounded by flames. The leftmost demon is holding a pitchfork and the next one has his hands down. They are looking at the third to the right standing a bit apart from them. This last demon, Maxwell's demon as given in the caption, holds his palms up while looking at the other two.]\n:Demon with pitchfork: What's our plan for the souls today? Boil them in oil? \n:Middle demon: We could cast them into the flame pit. \n:Maxwell's demon: What if we set up two rooms with a door in between, but– get this– '''''we only let them go through it one way!'''''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Maxwell's Demon had trouble fitting in with the others.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Maxwell's Demon]]"
