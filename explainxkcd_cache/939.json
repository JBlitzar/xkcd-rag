[[Cueball]] shoots an arrow off with a bow and a boomerang returns to him. This confounds him. As it was also a [[Cueball]] that threw the boomerang in the other comic, this may be the same Cueball that now finally has his boomerang return to him after a long time (464 comics and nearly three years later). This would really freak him out then.\n\nThe title text is a pun on how boomerangs always come back, along with how \"The Return of X\" is often used for movie names.\n\nHowever, as shown in the prequel as well as in an even earlier comic, Cueball/[[Randall]] has to admit: [[I Am Not Good with Boomerangs]]. So for him it would be a surprise if the boomerang returned!\n\nBoomerangs also became a main theme in the interactive comic [[1350: Lorenz]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands with a bow and arrow drawn tightly, aiming off-screen.]\n:[He fires the arrow, it disappears offscreen. The bowstring vibrates for effect.]\n:[He stands holding the bow by their side, watching the arrow fly away.]\n:[A boomerang flies on-screen, coming from the direction the arrow was fired. Cueball reaches up to catch the boomerang.]\n:[Cueball is now holding the boomerang, staring at it with confusion.]\n\n==Trivia==\n*Part of this comic and [[475: Further Boomerang Difficulties]] is the picture for the {{tvtropes|BrickJoke|Brick Joke}} page on TV Tropes.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Boomerangs]]"
