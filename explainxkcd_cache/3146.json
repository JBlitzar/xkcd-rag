Essentially, the same amount of fuel produces a larger change in kinetic energy if the burn occurs where the spacecraft’s speed is highest.\n\nIn the comic, the joke arises from confusing “birth” with “berth”: it suggests that the baby’s birth provides a propulsion boost to the ship, analogous to how the Oberth effect gives extra efficiency to maneuvers near a gravity well. In reality, the effect of a baby being born is negligible; the shift in the ship’s center of mass is far too small to produce any meaningful reaction-based thrust.\n\nThe comic references the movie ''{{w|The Fantastic Four: First Steps}}'' (2025), in which the characters go around a black hole and a baby is born onboard. While the birth occurs during the journey, it does not produce any actual propulsion boost.\n\nAdditionally, the title text references {{w|time dilation}} to extend the birthday from one day to over two days as seen from Earth, due to traveling at 88% of the speed of light. This combines relativistic physics humor with the pun on propulsion and orbital mechanics.\n\nThe Oberth effect is also mentioned as a key to escaping Origin in [[2765: Escape Speed]].\n```\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is facing Cueball with one of her hands out, facing up and towards Cueball.]\n:Ponytail: In the new ''Fantastic Four'' movie, their ship doesn't have enough fuel to get home and Sue Storm goes into labor, so they slingshot around a neutron star and fire their engines at periapsis — as Sue has her baby — to get a boost.\n:Cueball: Ah yes, the Obirth effect.\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
