The comic says that there is a boost because of the propulsion produced by the baby (a 'birth', rather than a 'berth'). In the movie, they do indeed go around a neutron star, and she does give birth to a baby while on board, but doesn't do that to get a boost.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\nThis effect is probably zero, as the change in the centre of mass of the ship and crew would not constitute a form of effective reaction-based propulsion.{{cn}} <!-- Although, together with a combination of tidal and relativistic effects, it technically ''could'' mean all the difference, on top of actual spacecraft thrust at, in an ''extremely'' finely tuned attempt to escape a gravity well. -->\n\nThe title text states that being born at 88% the speed of light results in a birthday that's over two days long. This is due to {{w|time dilation|time dilation}}: from the perspective of Earth, at 0.88 c, the dilation factor γ is 2.1. So one day is 2.1 days seen from Earth.\n\nThe Oberth effect was also mentioned as a key to escaping Origin in [[2765: Escape Speed]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is facing Cueball with one of her hands out, facing up and towards Cueball.]\n:Ponytail: In the new ''Fantastic Four'' movie, their ship doesn't have enough fuel to get home and Sue Storm goes into labor, so they slingshot around a neutron star and fire their engines at periapsis — as Sue has her baby — to get a boost.\n:Cueball: Ah yes, the Obirth effect.\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
