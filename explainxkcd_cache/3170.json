Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThis comic compares the effects that different internet service outages can have on people's {{w|productivity}}. When the service is essential to someone's work, their productivity will clearly go down. They may initially be able to switch to alternative tasks, but the longer the outage goes on, the more of their task stack will be blocked and the less they will be able to accomplish. However, if the service (such as the {{w|Star Wars Legends}} wiki) is non-essential, their productivity improves, implying that without access to the service they are less distracted and get more work done.\n\nThe title text makes a distinction between the productivity effects of the {{w|Canon (fiction)|canon}} and non-canon {{w|Star Wars}} wikis. A writer or editor for a forthcoming Star Wars product may have a work-related reason to review a wiki containing Star Wars canon, in order to ensure consistency with the work they are developing. Star Wars Legends, on the other hand, have been considered non-canon since 2014. The character of [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Natasi_Daala Admiral] [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Natasi_Daala Daala] is well documented, but a relatively niche line of interest.\n\nThis comic was posted the day after there was an outage at {{w|Cloudflare}}, a major {{w|content delivery network}} (CDN) whose failure affected this very site (among many others). This outage followed outages a few weeks ago at {{w|Microsoft Azure}} and {{w|Amazon Web Services}}, which provide {{w|cloud computing}} services, and fifteen months since {{w|2024 CrowdStrike-related IT outages|another significant outage}}. These aren't sites that most non-technical users are directly familiar with, but they provide infrastructure for many popular web sites, so their failures have wide-ranging impacts even for those who had been previously unaware of their role in their online life. For example, popular websites such as Netflix, Spotify, and Pinterest were affected by the AWS outage. The same day as the Cloudflare outage, there was also a {{w|Github}} outage; this site is used mainly to support software development.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[A graph of \"Productivity when a major internet service goes down\" over time]\n:[The productivity line starts at average.
