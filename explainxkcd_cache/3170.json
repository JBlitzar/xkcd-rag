Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] is comparing the effects that service outages for different websites can have on people's {{w|productivity}}. When the service (like {{w|xkcd}}) is essential to his work, his productivity will clearly go down. He may initially to be able to switch to alternative tasks which do not require it, but the longer the outage goes on, the more of his task stack will be blocked by it being unavailable, and the less he will be able to achieve. However, his productivity increases if the service (the {{w|Star Wars Legends}} wiki) is non-essential, implying that he frequently gets distracted by them.\n\nThe title text makes a distinction between the productivity effects of the {{w|Canon (fiction)|canon}} and non-canon {{w|Star Wars}} wikis. A writer or editor for a forthcoming Star Wars product may have a work-related reason to review a wiki containing Star Wars canon, in order to ensure consistency with the work they are developing. Star Wars Legends, on the other hand, have been considered non-canon since 2014. The character of [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Natasi_Daala Admiral] [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Natasi_Daala Daala] is well documented, but a relatively niche line of interest.\n\nThis comic was posted the day after there was an outage at {{w|Cloudflare}}, a major {{w|Content Delivery Network}} whose failure affected this very site (among many others). This followed a few weeks after there were outages at {{w|Microsoft Azure}} and {{w|Amazon Web Services}}, which provide {{w|cloud computing}} services, and fifteen months since {{w|2024 CrowdStrike-related IT outages|another significant outage}}. These aren't sites that most non-technical users are directly familiar with, but they provide infrastructure for many popular web sites, so their failures have wide-ranging impacts even for those who had been previously unaware of their role in their online life. The same day as the Cloudflare outage, there was also a {{w|Github}} outage; this site is used mainly to support software development.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[A graph of \"Productivity when a major internet service goes down\" over time]\n:[The productivity line starts at average.

It goes down over time.]\n:[The second line is labelled \"People whose work doesn't rely on the service\".
