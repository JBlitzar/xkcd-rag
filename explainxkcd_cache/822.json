As the internal monologues pair off and leave, they criticize the people whom they've been serving for so long, saying that they're made for one another, if only one of them would have the guts to start talking to the other.\n\nThe comic was guest-written by ''[http://questionablecontent.net Questionable Content]'' webcomic artist {{w|Jeph Jacques}}, whose romantic comedy series has lasted, as of 2025, more than 21 years and 5400 strips. The comic follows the vertical panel style typical of Questionable Content. But the art here is more in the [[xkcd]] style, showing only stick figures.{{spoiler|The following paragraph reveals some important plot details of the ''[http://questionablecontent.net Questionable Content]'' webcomic. If you don’t want to be spoiled, skip this paragraph.}}This comic may be a reference to Marten and Faye, two characters from Questionable Content. Marten meets Faye in QC #3 but is too shy to talk to her. Faye is less shy and introduces herself to Marten. Later, Marten and Faye are living together and have a crush for each other, but they don't get together because Faye is afraid of relationships since her father killed himself.\n\n''Guest Week'' was a series of five comics written by five other comic authors. They were released over five consecutive days (Monday-Friday); not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.<br>\nThe five comics are:\n*[[822: Guest Week: Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content)]]\n*[[823: Guest Week: David Troupes (Buttercup Festival)]]\n*[[824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot)]]\n*[[825: Guest Week: Jeffrey Rowland (Overcompensating)]]\n*[[826: Guest Week: Zach Weiner (SMBC)]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A girl is sitting on a bench, reading a book.
