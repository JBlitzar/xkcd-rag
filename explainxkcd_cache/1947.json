A common trend in lifestyle advice is the idea of \"{{w|Digital detox|unplugging}}\" and getting away from technology, with the idea that this can improve one's sense of well-being, and allow a focus on the important things in life, such as asking the {{w|Meaning of life|\"big\" existential questions}}.\n\n[[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are taking one such activity: a nighttime walk without their phones. However, rather than being grandiose, the questions they ask are increasingly immediate to their current situation. Far from finding the experience liberating, they find it first frustrating, as they no longer have access to useful features of their phones, such as mapping with GPS, which would help them find their way, and a flashlight, which would let them see where they were going, and then unsettling, as without their devices to distract them they begin to imagine dangers, such as {{w|cougar|mountain lions}}, lurking in the darkness.\n\nThe fact that Megan enthusiastically affirms that those really ''are'' the \"big questions\" of life reveals that they are sarcastically teasing each other about their regrettable decision.\n\nThe reference to mountain lions might be related to the declaration that eastern cougars were [http://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20180126/once-common-in-nc-eastern-cougar-declared-extinct-last-sighting-80-years-ago officially declared extinct] the day before this comic was published.\n\nThe title text claims that technology is so omnipresent that even the threatening mountain lion has a phone and is reading Facebook (and, therefore, is not so threatening, since it now can not notice them). Alternatively, either Cueball or Megan might be teasing the other.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are walking under the night sky.]\n:Megan: The internet is so overwhelming for me these days. It feels like everyone I know is yelling all the time.\n\n:[Frame is zoomed out. Stars are visible in the sky.]\n:Megan: That's why it's so nice to unplug. Leave the phones at home, go for a walk, and look up at the stars.\n:Megan: It helps you focus on what really matters.\n\n:[Frame is zoomed in again.]\n:Cueball: Like \"Where the hell are we?\"\n:Megan: And \"Why did I leave my phone at home? It has my map and flashlight.\"\n:Cueball: \"Are there mountain lions around here? Did you hear a twig break?\"\n:Megan: Yeah, the big questions!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]"
