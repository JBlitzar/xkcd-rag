Black Hat starts by critiquing traditional {{w|iceberg}}s, which are mostly hidden underwater, as inefficient. Efficiency is typically measured in relation to a desired outcome or purpose; Black Hat seems to imply that the obvious purpose for icebergs is to be seen above the water. He then presents his solution - a foam-filled iceberg that floats almost entirely above the water, claiming it to be highly efficient.\n\nBlack Hat's idea is characteristically absurd. Icebergs are naturally formed structures, with no particular purpose in existing. It is possible to imagine edge cases where a \"more efficient\" iceberg would be desirable, such as if the goal were to increase the overall {{w|albedo}} of the planet (perhaps to mitigate climate change), but on the whole his proposal to create a \"foam-filled iceberg\" is not only impractical but also comically exaggerated.\n\nBlack Hat then absurdly suggests that his lightweight iceberg can still pose a threat to ocean liners (as if that's the \"purpose\" of icebergs â€“ in the 20th century, at least {{w|List of ships sunk by icebergs|six ships sank as a result of iceberg collisions}}, most famously the ''{{w|RMS Titanic}}'') through the use of torpedoes. In addition, given that Black Hat is promoting the idea that icebergs ''should'' be able to damage ships, it's not really so inefficient to have much of the iceberg underwater, since ocean liners also have a significant portion of their hulls underwater, where they can be damaged by icebergs. The second panel shows that the foam-filled iceberg has a small attachment underneath it, perhaps a turret for launching torpedoes.\n\nThe unnamed individuals in the last panel are clearly baffled and concerned at how Black Hat got to presenting this slideshow, especially after Black Hat brings in the idea of torpedoes, presumably alerting them to the idea that the presentation is not just some incomprehensible novel idea for mitigating climate change or some other advantageous purpose. Realizing that Black Hat is not authorized to be there, presumably having snuck in with someone dealing with iceberg-related ideas, one of them calls for security. This is just another typical example of Black Hat presenting absurd ideas in a calm fashion.\n\nThe title text introduces the concept of an \"experimental aerogel iceberg with helium pockets.\" {{w|Aerogel|Aerogels}} are a class of solid, porous materials known for their extremely low density (making them among the lightest solid materials yet synthesized). Their low density should make them float well in liquids, though their low mass and their porous and brittle material properties make them unsuitable as a ramming implement. They are very strong for their mass, but would not be able to support iceberg-sized amounts without collapsing without internal supports which would vastly outweigh the aerogel. Most aerogels cannot float in water without some kind of surrounding coating or container, since the water would soak into the aerogel as it does a sponge. Worse, most aerogels are very hygroscopic, and [http://www.aerogel.org/?p=1433#:~:text=It%20is%20possible%20to%20make,superinsulating%20abilities%20without%20supercritical%20drying. contact with liquid water can destroy them] because attraction to the water collapses the structure. (This can be prevented by treating the aerogel with a hydrophobic material that coats the aerogel particles.) The structure of an aerogel surrounds pockets of air, leaving spaces that could be infused with a specific gas such as helium. {{w|Helium}} is lighter than air, and is often used to make gas-filled objects such as balloons float. An aerogel iceberg infused with helium gas could theoretically hover or fly like a balloon as suggested in the comic. This idea of producing a man-made flying iceberg for the sole purpose of endangering cruise liners is preposterous, as there's no reason to do this - and even if there were, more practical or direct methods of attacking such vessels exist.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe mention of this high-tech iceberg being able to \"more efficiently pursue fleeing hubristic liners\" is a playful nod to the comic's theme of optimizing icebergs for efficiency at attacking ocean liners. It implies that not only can this special iceberg float efficiently, but also that it's equipped to chase after and \"efficiently pursue\" arrogant or prideful ocean liners, turning the concept of iceberg efficiency into a surreal scenario. The \"hubris\" alludes to the (possibly apocryphal) quote \"God himself couldn't sink this ship\" and similar sentiments expressed in reference to the ''{{w|Titanic}}''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is holding a stick and standing next to a projection screen, or rolled-down printed poster, featuring an image of an iceberg halfway submerged in water, presenting to an unseen audience to the right.]\n:Black Hat: A standard iceberg is only 10% efficient.\n:Black Hat: 90% of the ice is hidden underwater, totally wasted.\n\n:[Black Hat is now seen face on, standing next to an updated image of the same iceberg with another \"iceberg\" with all but a small hemispherical lobe almost entirely above the surface of the water now to the right of it.]\n:Black Hat: Our next-generation foam-filled iceberg achieves near-100% efficiency, floating almost entirely above the ocean surface.\n\n:[Black Hat is still holding a stick, facing right, any current image/screen no longer visible to his rear.
