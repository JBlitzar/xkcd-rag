Studies on nasal irrigation, however, have had mixed results, and the practice may not in fact be beneficial. \n\nRandall's {{w|Wikipedia}} path: {{w|Virus}} →‎ {{w|Immune system}} →‎ {{w|Innate immune system}} →‎ {{w|Parasites}} →‎ {{w|List of parasites of humans}} →‎ ''{{w|Naegleria fowleri}}'' →‎ {{w|Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis}}.\n\n''Naegleria fowleri'' is known as the brain-eating amoeba. It is found in warm bodies of stagnant {{w|fresh water}} and causes the disease primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a rare but highly lethal condition. Although N. fowleri are not commonly found in aquaria, Randall's Wikipedia wanderings force him to conclude that attempting to clear out his sinuses with an aquarium pump is too risky. Since this danger would presumably not be present at all with an unused, sterilized aquarium pump, the comic may be referring to a particular pump currently in use and close at hand.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[This comic shows a pie chart with 5 slices, each with a label and a line pointing to these five different sized slices. There is a caption above the chart:]\n:Activities while sick:\n:[The labels on each slice is given in clockwise order starting from the top. The percentages are estimated from the image and are noted in the square brackets before the transcript:]\n:[54%] - Shifting around in bed feeling my skin crawl\n:[23%] - Wiping various face holes\n:[5%] - Staring at a news site but not reading it\n:[14%] - Thinking about how cool it is that I'm partly made of an army of critters that patrol my body ruthlessly dispatching anything they find trying to prey on me.\n:[4%] - Pondering hooking an aquarium pump up to my sinuses\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Pie charts]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]"
