However, some people have a lot of silly or funny songs in the same music library as their more dramatic or romantic song choices. If the library is left to randomly choose songs from the whole library, those more whimsical songs could easily come up, suddenly ending the intimate mood.\n\nCueball is performing {{w|cunnilingus}} on Megan, while a particularly goofy song, the {{w|Power Rangers Theme}}, plays in the background. The title text alludes to an even sillier song, the {{w|Monty Python}} song {{w|The Lumberjack Song|Lumberjack}}, which is about a transvestite lumberjack.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Important life lesson: If there's any possibility of sex, do ''not'' leave your music library on \"shuffle all.\"\n:[Megan lies down in a bed, while Cueball is beneath the bed sheets with his head between her legs. On the other side of the room, a computer is turned on and playing music.]\n:Megan: *GASP* MMMMM-\n:Computer: GO GO POWER RANGERS!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
