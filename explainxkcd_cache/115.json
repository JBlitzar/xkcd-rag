But it says nothing about meerkats.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe situation is a reference to the {{tvtropes|AnimalAthleteLoophole|animal athlete loophole}} trope, where an animal joins an underdog<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[559|''no pun intended'']]<nowiki>]</nowiki></sup> sports team and saves the day. The other team, which is previously dominant, and usually has an entitled and/or bullying attitude, does not like it, but since there is not a specific rule against it, it has to be allowed.\n\nRandall's combination of animal ({{w|Meerkat}}) and sport ({{w|Rugby football|rugby}}) is particularly unlikely, since meerkats are relatively small, slight animals, whereas rugby is associated with big powerful players, and has not been used in an animal sports movie before.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text implies that, as a result of similar instances of animal recruitment in the past, rule changes have been introduced to specifically exclude those animals from taking part, which may be why this team has had to work its way down to meerkats. The governing bodies could probably have avoided this by simply excluding non-human animals.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Meerkat wearing a {{w|scrum cap}} and blue jersey, and two guys in the background supposedly on a rugby field.]\n:You have to admit--there's no rule on the books saying a Meerkat can't play rugby.\n\n==Trivia==\n\nA golden retriever is at the centre of the basketball film ''{{w|Air Bud}}''.\n\nIn the film ''{{w|Mr. Go (film)|Mr. Go}}'', a gorilla becomes a star of the Korean Baseball League.\n\nThis concept was revisited in [[1552: Rulebook]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Sport]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
