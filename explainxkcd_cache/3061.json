Mesons, which are subatomic particles, have a very low mass and a very short lifetime, as they naturally decay into other fundamental particles.{{Actual citation needed}} \"Flying water balloons\" are depicted as having a mass centered around 1 kilogram, but the area outlined covers a very broad range of mass (from grams to hundreds of kilos), and a lifetime centered around 1 second (but the area outlined covers from fractions of a second to a couple of hours), indicating the approximate amount of time that a water balloon is expected to be in the process of being thrown through the air. Not all water balloons break on impact, and they may be prepared well in advance, so specifying \"flying\" indicates that it isn't the lifetime of the intact (and water-filled) balloon. Additionally, some are thrown directly into someone's face, thus their flight time would be extremely short, or non-existant if 'planted' before even being released. Finally, planets have a very large mass and a very long lifetime, as they tend to exist for billions of years.\n\nThis comparison is somewhat absurd because the objects being compared - mesons, water balloons, and planets - do not have much in common. The joke is revealed in the image caption: an \"annual interdepartmental water balloon fight\" where multiple departments of a facility/company are pit against each other.\n\nAllegedly, because water balloons are so different from both mesons and planets in terms of size and lifetime (roughly the same number of orders of magnitude), meson particle physicists and planetary scientists are usually evenly matched in water balloon fights. This suggests that deep specialization in a field of study deprives a normal person of their basic aptitude to perform in more 'everyday' activities, but at least it equally disadvantages each of the two teams of researchers and makes for a more satisfyingly [[1819: Sweet 16|competitive match-up]] than with one team clearly far more proficient than the other. By the same logic, one might assume that more generalized physicists might study similar objects with the mass and lifetime of water balloons (if not water balloons themselves!), and other topics of education might also confer an 'advantage' (for example, biologists may study similarly-sized bodies of creatures, whilst chemists may monitor chemical reactions that could take an equivalent time to complete).\n\nIn real life, water balloon fights are completely unrelated to particle physics or planetary science, and there's nothing stopping a particle physicist or planetary scientist from ''also'' having experience with water balloons.\n\nThe title text continues the joke by stating that \"The physics department has recruited an astronomer who studies meteor fireballs\". This is likely referring to the fact that [[3049: Incoming Asteroid|meteors are closer in size and lifetime to water balloons]] than either mesons or planets, so having an astronomer with this area of expertise would be advantageous in a water balloon fight against scientists who study either of the latter. \"Space rocks\" that become meteors may have been around for approximately the age of the solar system (and longer than at least some planets), and may then sit on/beneath the ground as a {{w|meteorite}} for anything up to geologically significant lengths of time. But being an actual meteor (and a flaming one, at that) implies we're only considering the period of time the space rock is traveling through the Earth's atmosphere, specifically ending when it becomes a meteorite. This is a period of time that may be anything from a few seconds (the normal upper limit to the visible 'fireball' stage) to ''possibly'' a minute or two (starting from its first shallow-angle grazing of the atmosphere until it finally lands/burns up/passes back out of the atmosphere). Thus, by one team bringing in a more capable player (especially one arguably more closely aligned to their opponents), they apparently now have an {{wiktionary|ringer#Noun 4|unfair advantage}}.\n\nExtrapolation and interpolation, often absurd, are [[:Category:Extrapolation|recurrent topics]] on xkcd. For example, in [[3050: Atom]], an atom was blown up to the size of a water balloon, with the responsible scientists complaining about it being wet.<!--it was explainers on explainxkcd who pointed out that enlarging a small handleable object the same way as that atom, would result in a planetary object.--> One of the planets (Earth) was depicted on another 2D interpolation chart but with different units in [[2893: Sphere Tastiness]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Graph with Y axis labeled \"Mass\" running from 10<sup>-30</sup> kg to 10<sup>30</sup> kg on a logarithmic scale and X axis labeled \"Lifetime\", also on a logarithmic scale, running from 10<sup>-20</sup>  to 10<sup>20</sup> seconds.]\n\n:[There are three elliptical blobs on the graph: one on the lower left corner labeled \"Mesons\", another on the upper right corner labeled \"Planets\", and another in the middle (1kg mass, 1s lifespan) labeled \"Flying water balloons\".
