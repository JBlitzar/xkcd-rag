What if there's a voyeur watchi-- wait, now I'm turned on too.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nAfter running some analysis on a database, [[Cueball]] shows [[Megan]] a chart depicting the relationship between sexual arousal and consecutive vowels, showing that a high amount of consecutive vowels is linked to higher sexual arousal. At first, it could be theorised to be due to drawn out moans or screams during lovemaking and orgasm (Ooooh! Yeeeees!).\n\nMegan says she doesn't get it, but Cueball interrupts her with \"queueing\", a word with 5 consecutive vowels. This {{tvtropes|CoitusEnsues|immediately arouses Megan, who grabs Cueball and shouts \"FUCK ME NOW.\"}} It turns out that the consecutive vowels themselves appear to cause arousal, rather than arousal causing the use of consecutive vowels.\n\nThe title text shows that Cueball is fearful that there may be a voyeur peeking at them, but as \"voyeur\" has 4 consecutive vowels because \"y\" is a vowel in this case, Cueball gets turned on as well.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands at the left while Cueball comes from right holding up a chart.]\n:Cueball: I was running a factor analysis on this huge database, and check out what it found:\n\n:[An xy-graph plotting \"sexual arousal\" against \"consecutive vowels.\" The trendline through the dots is a smooth exponential increasing curve.]\n\n:[Frameless panel:]\n:Megan: Huh? This chart makes no sense. What-\n:Cueball: \"Queueing\"\n\n:[Zoom in, Megan grabs Cueball.]\n:Megan: ''FUCK ME NOW.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
