[[Cueball]] tries to help [[Megan]], who is in psychological or emotional distress, but despite his efforts she ends up in an ambulance. It's implied that she either attempted suicide, severe self-harm, or hurt herself in some other way. The point is that sometimes no amount of help from the outside can help someone who is internally suffering.\n\nThe title text implies a hidden button behind a bookshelf that would solve Megan's problems, but Cueball did not find it in time. This ironic sentence implies that helping someone in psychological or emotional distress has never been as simple as pressing a button.\n\nGiven [[Randall]]'s implied negative feelings towards {{w|Valentine's Day}}, shown in the majority of his [[:Category:Valentines|Valentine's Day comics]], it may not be a coincidence that he sent this one out the day before February 14. He did not draw any Valentine's Day related comics this year as he did before.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above and to the right of Cueball's head.]\n:It turns out you can't take responsibility for someone else's happiness.\n\n:[Cueball looking at a curled-up Megan across an enclosed room.]\n\n:[Cueball's hand on Megan's shoulder.]\n\n:[Megan has her head in her hands.]\n\n:[Cueball watches as two Cueballs wearing blue hats take Megan away in a stretcher into an ambulance with a partially omitted blue cross.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
