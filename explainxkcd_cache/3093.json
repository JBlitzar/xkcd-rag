In aerodynamics, {{w|Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting}} is an aerodynamic technique where one moving object follows another one closely to reduce drag by using the first objects {{w|slipstream}}. It is used in various sports, most prominently {{w|cycling}}, specifically {{w|mass start}} {{w|Road bicycle racing#Drafting|road racing}} or some {{w|track cycling}} events. Also in motorsports, before the invention of high {{w|downforce}} drafting was {{w|1971 Italian Grand Prix|quite important}}. On normal roads drafting can be used by trucks looking to save fuel. While this can give an aerodynamic advantage to both follower and followed if done right, in some cases the disturbances in airflow can actually reduce efficiency. It can also create significant danger of collision if the one being followed has to suddenly manoeuvre or reduce speed.\n\nThe comic explores the idea of using drafting for rockets and states that, while it theoretically works, it isn't really recommended. The title text gives more details on this, claiming that although there is an efficiency gain of 5% through drafting via the general mechanism, it also comes with a 99% loss. Trying to closely follow a rocket, directly against the flow of its extremely hot and high-speed exhaust, could have adverse effects on the follower's flight and structural integrity. There might also be a risk to the leader, if the follower collides with it or if the follower explodes.\n\nGenerally, this could be understood because land transportation is based on traction (pulling yourself along a surface via friction). At higher speeds (above 60km/h), the dominant force becomes wind drag. {{w|Energy-efficient driving}} at these higher speeds can be improved by drafting behind another vehicle. This doesn't apply to rockets because they do not move themselves via friction but rather via Newton's third law (throwing stuff backwards). This means that the front rocket would just push the back rocket against its own thrust (among other bad effects).\n\nIt should be mentioned that drafting behind another land vehicle in regular traffic is a potentially lethal high-risk endeavour, as the truck in front of you may suddenly have to brake for one reason or another, and human reaction times are generally too long to rely upon when you're close enough for this method to have any significant effect. Rockets do not suddenly brake in mid-flight,{{Citation needed}} so this may be said in their favour as leading vehicles â€” that is of course, if you feel that blowing up in a spectacular fireball is preferable to being violently crushed into a metal pancake. In [[Simple Writer|simpler terms]], if you do this [[1133: Up Goer Five|you will have a bad problem and you will not go to space today, or maybe ever]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A rocket with two boosters is launching going towards the top right corner. It has a two-stage core and two boosters, and they produce three flames from their exhaust and beneath these flames is a large exhaust plume fanning out behind the rocket most of the way towards the bottom of the panel. A smaller rocket is following the first rocket. It is very close to the first rocket, so most of the smaller rocket is inside the exhaust plume from the larger rocket. The smaller rocket does not have boosters, but still produces three smaller flames from its exhaust. Beneath these flames the smaller rocket also leaves a large but slimmer exhaust plume that exits the panel at the bottom left corner.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Aerospace tip: Although the technique reduces atmospheric drag for many types of vehicles, you should '''''never''''' try to improve rocket launch efficiency through drafting.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Tips]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]"
