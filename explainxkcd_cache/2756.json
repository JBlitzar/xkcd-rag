From the conversation, it seems clear that he has used some prior access to the employment records at the employment record office he worked at to fraudulently manufacture a history of having worked there for 600 years. There are some institutions that are extant today with over 600 years of history, but, with the exception of some arms of the {{w|Catholic Church}}, none of their individual offices or departments have existed for that long; also, human lifespans rarely exceed 100 years, never mind 600.{{Citation needed}} He also claims an additional pair of prestigious jobs in the title text, but it is unclear whether these 'facts' were entirely due to false records or, knowing Black Hat's [[498: Secretary: Part 5|other]] [[1094: Interview|interviews]], briefly true but only as a result of false representation/underhanded actions.\n\nHis interviewers, Cueball and Hairbun, are not entirely unaware of the implausibility, but Hairbun, at least, seems content to have just verified the validity of the claim. The 'validation' arises from the clearly tainted information source, given the whole chain of supporting evidence that may have been falsified. This is essentially a more elaborate version of Black Hat's ploy in another interview [[125: Marketing Interview|17 years prior]].\n\nEmployers often encounter résumés that have implausibly padded experience claims. Most applicants try not to be this implausible, and few employers are so credulous as to take self-supporting lies at face value.\n\nThe title text suggests that [[Black Hat]] changed the records during his position at the employment records office to make it look like he was president of MIT and CEO of IBM.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Black Hat sits in an office chair. Cueball, facing him, sits on another office chair at his desk and Hairbun stands behind him. Cueball is holding documents in his hands.]\n:Cueball: Impressive résumé.\n:Cueball: It says that you have over '''''six hundred''''' years of experience at the employment records office? That can't be right.\n:Hairbun: I thought so too, but it checks out.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Job interviews]]"
