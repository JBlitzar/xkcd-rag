Bug threads may be found on bug trackers, such as Github or Bugzilla, on technical forums such as StackOverflow, or on general product user forums.\n\nMost bug threads have a rule to only leave a comment if you have something insightful to add,{{Actual citation needed}} such as being able to reproduce how the bug occurs or possible solutions to resolving it. In practice, this rule is often ignored and many threads end up with multiple people simply commenting that the bug still exists. It could be argued that this, in itself, is additional information, since it gives an indication of how widespread and/or persistent the problem is. Those who are perfectly content with a product have few reasons to participate in a bug thread, so those seeking help will tend to mostly read posts by the others who are, or have been, seeking help, if no one has provided a proper solution.\n\nIn this comic, multiple people are reporting the problem, as we can tell from their distinctive profile pictures. Most of the visible posts simply state the poster's inclusion in the list of those affected by the bug, either with a one word reply (\"Same\"), or a shorthand expression of emotion (\"{{w|Like button|+1}}. So frustrating.\"). Some posters, however, do provide somewhat more useful information: existing troubleshooting methods haven't worked for them, with one even providing three links to the specific solutions that they have already unsuccessfully tried.\n\nAlthough we cannot see the unreadable timestamp information on the posts, one author (the penultimate, using a [[White Hat]] image) makes the observation that the problem has now been ongoing for five years. This is followed by a [[Cueball]]-identified user proposing that this group of like-minded individuals may enjoy meeting up at a {{w|beach house}} in the physical world. Whether this is [[Randall]], or not, his own follow-up comic commentary suggests that bonding over such adversity is as good a reason for friendship as any.\n\nThe title text reveals that the meet-up was actually attempted. However, ironically, some of the participants seem to have run into \"account issues\" when trying to make their reservations, meaning that the website where they tried to rent the beach house wasn't working properly for them. Fortunately that website contained an online support forum like the one in the comic, and six participants from that forum ended up joining the social group. It is unclear whether the meet-up actually ended up occurring, but at least everyone involved now has some new friends.\n\n[[979: Wisdom of the Ancients]] also refers to an online discussion thread about a bug, and [[1305: Undocumented Feature]] also involves a tech support forum which is eventually used only for socializing.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Part of a discussion thread in progress on an online forum is shown. Each comment has the writer's avatar to the left of the text and small illegible text immediately above the text. Part of the first comment's text is cut off at the top.]\n:Commenter #1 (icon is a portrait of a stick figure's head with the top half obscured): Same issue here.\n:Commenter #2 (icon is a full-body picture of Cueball): I'm having this problem too. None of the posted fixes work.\n:Commenter #3 (icon is a thick black stripe going across the icon square from its upper-rightmost corner to its lower-leftmost, with another black stripe in the lower-rightmost corner): Same.\n:Commenter #4 (icon is a portrait of Megan's head): +1. So frustrating.\n:Commenter #5 (icon is a full-body picture of Hairy left of a horizontal line above an unintelligible shape and a small scribble): I'm still having this. Did you all ever figure out a fix?\n:Commenter #6 (icon is a forward-facing bust of Blondie): Same problem as everyone. I tried the steps in the posts <u>here</u>, <u>here</u>, and <u>here</u>. Nothing.\n:Commenter #7 (icon is a pure black square with a white circle in the center): Add me to the list.\n:Commenter #8 (icon is a portrait of White Hat's head): Same. Ugh. Can't believe this thread is 5 years old now.\n:Commenter #9 (icon is a forward-facing portrait of Cueball): Where does everyone live? Do we want to get a beach house for a weekend or something?\n:[Caption below the image:]\n:At some point, you just have to give up on fixing the bug and embrace the fact that you have dozens of new friends.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
