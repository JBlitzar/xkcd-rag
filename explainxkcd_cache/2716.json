The characters are discussing which to use during an evening of tabletop gaming. The group has a running competition to see who can mention fake apps or services without being called out. The idea being that, since there are so many, it is difficult to identify which are real.\n\n[[Cueball]] mentions three food delivery services, {{w|Grubhub}}, {{w|DoorDash}}, and Food.net, and [[Ponytail]] asks him to reimburse her using {{w|Venmo}}, {{w|PayPal}}, or Yahoo Cash. Cueball expresses skepticism about Yahoo Cash, after which Ponytail admits it's a fake service (it's a spoof of {{w|Google Pay}}) and is thus obligated to pay for Cueball's meal. (Incidentally, Yahoo does provide a money transfer service to facilitate private party gambling on {{w|fantasy sports}}, called [https://sports.yahoo.com/wallet/dailyfantasy/referafriend/ Yahoo Fantasy Wallet], but it uses PayPal.) Food.net, which Cueball mentioned without being called out, is not a real service; https://food.net exists, however, it is not related to food delivery.\n\nBased on Ponytail's offer, if someone is correctly called out, they must pay for the player who caught them. If a player isn't caught, like when Cueball mentions Food.net, nothing happens. Ponytail is too afraid to call him out on this, and decides to order from a service that she knows exists, Grubhub, and then tries to bluff the others using strange payment methods. \n\nIt is not explained in the comic, but you probably also have to pay for the other person's food if you call a bluff, and it turns out the service did indeed exist. So if [[Megan]] had said to Cueball, \"Grubhub? That must be fake,\" and he then proved that it exists (by ordering there), then Megan would most likely be obliged to pay for Cueball's food. \n\nThe title text offers a tip for winning the competition next week after being called out for mentioning a fake service: building a working version and then mentioning it again next week. While it could be possible to prototype a user interface and possibly use it to perform food deliveries with a very limited number of drivers in a small area, or provide a front-end interface to an existing money transfer service with strong API support, building a full-fledged viable service for either in a week is humorously beyond the reach of typical gamers. Also, as in Ponytail's case, it could cause trademark issues with brand names.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail are sitting at a table to order food. Cueball is on his phone, and Ponytail, sitting opposite, is on her laptop.]\n:Cueball: What should we use to order? Grubhub? DoorDash? Food.net?\n:Ponytail: I'll do Grubhub; you can send me money. Do you do Venmo? Paypal? Yahoo Cash?\n:Cueball: Yahoo Cash ''has'' to be fake.\n:Ponytail: Yes. Dang. I'll get your share.\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Our game night has an ongoing competition to see who can mention the most fake apps and services without getting called on it.  \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Games]]"
