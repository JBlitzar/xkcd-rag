He thinks that society should provide a service that collects reports about such notorious liars, warning future dates about their true nature.\n\nCueball's friend, [[White Hat]], is concerned about the accuracy of the information, comparing this proposed service to {{w|Sex offender registration|sex offender registries}}, presumably suggesting that people would not want to operate such a database because of the risk of civil liability for defamation from inaccurate information, or simply that innocent people would be harmed if it was inaccurate. Cueball responds by suggesting that, if such a database could not be operated as a profitable business, a state's government might be willing to operate it because of the benefits to society.\n\nIn the last panel, we see such a notification being given to a woman at a date. One interpretation of this comic could be that the bearded man is not, in fact, a douchebag, but Cueball is calling him one because he is attracted to her, and thus wants to separate them.\n\nThe \"State of California\" wording is a reference to {{w|California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65}} which requires specific products to have labels reading \"This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\" California is also known for being a state with a government unusually willing to try out new policy ideas.\n\nSomething like this happened with the \"Tea\" app, which went down in flames.\n\nThe title text lists a few \"{{w|douchebag}}\" warning signals that the woman should have observed.\n\n{{w|Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer}} were known for making shallow parody movies which were notoriously negatively received; some of their movies, including ''{{w|Epic Movie}}'' and ''{{w|Disaster Movie}}'', are considered to be among the worst movies ever made. That the woman can be charged $20 without her prior consent indicates that this is in fact a government service, as this could be done through the power to tax.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and White Hat are walking.]\n:Cueball: It just blows my mind. She seemed so genuine. I had no idea she was such a serial liar.\n:Cueball: I just wish I had our six months back.\n\n:[The view focuses on Cueball.]\n:Cueball: Her exes say the same thing happened to them.\n:Cueball: Maybe what we need is a terrible-ex tracking and notification service.\n\n:[Cueball turns, thoughtfully.]\n:White Hat: But after all the problems with sex offender registries, who would agree to run it?\n:Cueball: Maybe one of the state governments more willing to experiment could try it out...\n\n:Soon...\n:[Megan and a person with glasses and a goatee are sitting at a table, on which sit wine glasses and plates. Cueball approaches them carrying a clipboard and a license.]\n:Cueball: Excuse me, ma'am.\n:Megan: Yes?\n:Cueball: This man is known to the state of California to be a ''total douchebag''.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
