Actor Robert Newton played the pirate Long John Silver with an exaggerated \"West Country\" accent (his native dialect, and one that would have been heard due to the area's {{w|Bristol#15th and 16th centuries|established involvement}} in maritime business) and it became associated with all pirates.\n* \"Ten-Four\" is {{w|Ten-code|police code}} for \"Yes\" and was popular during the 1970s CB radio craze.\n\nPut together, the exchange roughly translates to \"Do you truly understand what I'm saying, my friends?\"/\"Yes, we understand!\". The characters also combine archaic weapons like a spear and a sword with a presumably modern handgun and a laptop, adding to the growing heap of anachronisms.\n\n[[Randall]]'s contention is that hundreds of years from now, people will make similar errors that we do today when depicting historical items and language. Modern movies, fiction, and other forms of media that depict history often confuse terms, items, and equipment that were in one place and time period and place them in another, but few people notice because to them, all of it fits under the very broad category of \"old, historical things\" - only those with an interest in history really notice or seem to care. Thus following this trend, in the future, things like laptop computers and \"grok my jive\" will seem just as historical and \"old-timey\" as a spear or the saying \"Forsooth!\", except to those who participate in such things like \"Blogger Reenactment Festivals\", as mentioned in the title text.\n\nFor instance, take a suit of full plate armor. To most people, plate armor is a \"Medieval thing\". So thus, when depicting King Arthur, a figure from 500 to 800 AD (if he even existed at all), one would (and has) put him in a suit of full plate because he is \"medieval\" and that is the stereotypical equipment of a Medieval figure. In actual fact, plate armor only came about after 1350, many centuries after King Arthur would have lived, and it coexisted alongside firearms for a very long time. King Arthur would have worn chainmail, but all of this would be lost on an average person watching a movie about King Arthur, to whom chainmail and full plate are interchangeable under the label of \"historical armor\" in their minds (though may represent an 'underclass' and 'overclass' of men-at-arms, for each respective type of main protection). It is not much of a jump from a span of 500 to 800 years of equipment being considered interchangeable to 1500 years of equipment and language being interchangeable. A similar confusion of \"interchangeably old things\" is seen in the title text to [[2396: Wonder Woman 1984]].\n\nThe title text likely refers to [[239: Blagofaire]], which features the said \"Blogger Reenactment Festivals\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A sword-wielding Cueball on a stage addresses three others; one has a spear, another a handgun and a knife, and the third a laptop.]\n:Cueball: Forsooth, do you grok my jive, me hearties?\n:Actors: Ten-four!\n:[The caption below.]\n:A few centuries from now, all the English of the past 400 years will sound equally old-timey and interchangeable.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
