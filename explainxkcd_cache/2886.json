His team is pretty sure that most of these bursts are energetic stellar objects in space - that is, astronomical phenomena.\n\nHe then says that some of them are caused by {{w|microwave oven}}s, citing Dr. Emily Petroff's work on identifying the apparent source of \"{{w|Peryton (astronomy)|peryton}}s\" at the {{w|Parkes Observatory}}.<ref>E.Petroff et al. (2015). \"[https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/451/4/3933/1119649?login=false Identifying the source of perytons at the Parkes radio telescope]\". ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'', '''451'''(4):3933â€“3940.</ref> These are signals similar to fast radio bursts, but which originate on Earth and not in space; initial hypotheses included atmospheric effects related to {{w|lightning}} and passing aircraft, but they were eventually identified as a much closer range signal from microwaves escaping as the oven door was opened inside the observatory.\n\nAfter that, he explores two further options, combining attributes of the previous two:\n\n* Energetic stellar-sized microwave ovens floating in space; this is unlikely since microwave ovens typically are not stellar-sized and all known microwave ovens originate on Earth rather than in space. (There is [https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202106/30/WS60dbaca4a310efa1bd65ebc9.html a microwave oven] installed in the Chinese Tiangong space station, but it appears that the ISS [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235555 is less well equipped] than that. Neither facility is ever likely to have room for 'stellar-sized' equipment of any kind.)\n* An energetic stellar-sized object in the observatory break room would be surprising, as we have yet to see a break room large enough to contain a stellar-sized object. Although unlikely, he plans to send a grad student there to double-check. Presumably, the student is being sent rather than Cueball himself both because it is unlikely to give useful data, and because if there is indeed energetic stellar plasma in the break room, the million-degree temperatures would probably kill anyone who enters it, and grad students are {{w|Redshirt (stock character)|disposable}} when compared to researchers.\n\nNote that, as well as the ''universe-''sized {{w|Cosmic microwave background}} radiation, there are various microwave-bright {{w|Pulsar}}s and other strong microwave signals [https://www.space.com/40840-nanodiamonds-mysterious-cosmic-microwave-light.html originating from actual stars], but no reason to believe that they are deliberately purposed/engineered as any actual oven, despite [https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-sees-a-stellar-furnace/ misleading language] sometimes employed by those in the field.\n\nThe title text references several other discoveries, with Dr. Petroff suggesting explanations based on microwave ovens for each of them, as was the case with her discovery:\n\n* The apparent detection of the {{w|Higgs boson}} at the Large Hadron Collider was actually someone [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCrtk-pyP0I microwaving grapes], which generates plasma\n* The [https://science.nasa.gov/resource/first-image-of-a-black-hole/ image of a black hole] captured by the Event Horizon Telescope was a burning bagel (a notably ring-shaped bread product with the charred portion being black)\n* {{w|LIGO}} (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) did not detect gravitational waves, but was instead disturbed by someone slamming the microwave door too hard\n\nIn each case, these are highly improbable - for instance, LIGO used a complex suspension system, and two sites (one in Louisiana and one in Washington State) comparing signals, to rule out such interference. The real Dr. Petroff has not made any such claims.{{Citation needed}}\n\nSee [[2289: Scenario 4]] for a similar situation.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball standing behind a lectern, with a poster hung from the ceiling behind him, raising his hand]\n\n: Potential sources of fast radio bursts:\n:(1) Energetic stellar-sized astrophysical objects floating in space\n:Cueball: We're pretty sure this is what most of them are.\n\n:[Close-up on Cueball, not raising hand.]\n\n:(2) Microwave ovens in the observatory break room\n:Cueball: This was some of them, oops.
