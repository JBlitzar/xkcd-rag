You should've gone to the screening at CERN.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|String theory}} hypothesizes that there are many more than 3 {{w|dimension|dimensions}}, it's just that we can't see the rest because they're \"rolled up.\" A common metaphor is an ant on a tightrope — it has two degrees of freedom, one along the rope and one around it, but from far away we can only see one.\n\nKnowing this, [[Black Hat]], showing his typical behaviour, released his 2D movie about string theory in \"3D\", and claimed that the third dimension was there — just too small to see.\n\nThe title text refers to a {{w|linear particle accelerator}}, or \"LINAC\", which is used to create high-energy particles. Incidentally, the glasses give their particles one mega-electronvolt (symbol {{w|MeV}}) of energy, which is not particularly high for a particle accelerator. The title text suggests that such moviegoers should try the accelerators at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, {{w|CERN}}, since they are widely known for producing the highest energies in the TeV, and thus have the best chance of unraveling the small dimensions of string theory.\n\nOn the [http://3d.xkcd.com/848/ xk3d prank site] created along with [[880: Headache]], the 3D on this comic is not visible.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, another Cueball and Megan are lined up to see a movie.]\n:Premiering Tonight:\n:String Theory:\n:An Exposé\n:Presented In 3D!\n\n:[Cueball, Cueball 2 and Megan are in a dark theater, fiddling with their 3D glasses.]\n:''???''\n\n:[Cueball, Cueball 2 and Megan angrily approach Black Hat, who's sitting at a desk.]\n:Megan: Your movie was a ripoff.\n:Cueball: It wasn't 3D at all!\n:Black Hat: Was too.\n:Black Hat: It's just that the third dimension is tightly rolled up and too small to observe at normal energies.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
