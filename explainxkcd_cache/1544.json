    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1544\n| date      = June 29, 2015\n| title     = Margaret\n| image     = margaret.png\n| titletext = Otherwise known as Margaret the Destroyer, I will bring pain to the the Great One. Then again, maybe I won't.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic uses the starting lines of an innocent children's book and creates irony by delivering a dark message.\n\nIn the book ''{{w|Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.}}'' by {{w|Judy Blume}}, the opening lines are \"Are you still there, God? It's me, Margaret. I know you're there, God. I know you wouldn't have missed this for anything! Thank you, God. Thanks an awful lot...\" These lines describe a prayer, in which Margaret privately speaks to God, expressing gratitude and seeking guidance.\n\nIn the second and third panels, Margaret asks God \"Are you scared, God?\", and states \"You should be\". This is similar to threats delivered in some action movies, such as Taken, in which the protagonist or antagonist speaks directly to their opponent, issuing threats and indicating that they are coming after their opponent. The final panel is a shot of Margaret standing imposingly in a dark landscape, and a caption over the top of the image says \"Margaret is coming for you\", making this comic reminiscent of an action movie trailer. The irony is that \"Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret.\" is a very innocent book, especially when compared to this type of action movie.\n\nThe title text is a mashup of three of Blume's other books: ''{{w|Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great}}'', ''{{w|The Pain and the Great One}}'', and ''{{w|Then Again, Maybe I Won't}}'', and likely the inspiration for the dark lines in the comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Margaret, shown in full body, is alone. She is talking while looking out towards the reader.]\n:Margaret: Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.\n:Margaret: I know you're listening.\n\n:[Zoom in on her face and torso.]\n:Margaret: Are you scared, God?\n:Margaret: Are you?\n\n:[Zooming so far in that not even her whole face is visible.]\n:Margaret: You should be.\n\n:[Zooming far out showing her in a white silhouette against a black sky, standing on the white earth.]\n:Margaret: ''Margaret is coming for you''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*There seems to be a typo in the title text with double the:\n**''I will bring pain to '''the the''' Great One''.\n**It could however also be a reference to the book ''The Pain and the Great One'', so this is the \"The Great One\".\n**Maybe it was supposed to be \"thee, The Great One\".\n\n*There doesn't seem to be a typo if you pause after the first the. '''thee the''' would have been better. Realizing that God is \"the Great One\" may be the reason for the last part of the title text (Then again, maybe I won't.)\n*I know you're listening\" may refer to an earlier xkcd comic, [[525: I Know You're Listening]].\n*The idea of turning an innocent children's book into a violent movie was previously touched in [[633: Blockbuster Mining]].\n*Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret was previously referenced in the title text of [[1354: Heartbleed Explanation]], in the form of a fictional conversation between Margaret and a computing running OpenSSL, explaining the problems with the {{w|Heartbleed bug}} and why it should be addressed and fixed.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Religion]]"
