Despite systems like this having existed for over 60 years, no president has ever used it, even during major incidents like the {{w|September 11 attacks}}. In this comic, the US President accidentally activates the system by pressing a button, apparently located on the {{w|Resolute Desk|''Resolute'' Desk}} in the {{w|Oval Office}}. Surprised by being on television, he tries to think of something important to say on the spot, but cannot think of anything other than a piece of generic dental-hygiene advice â€“ a rather non-urgent message.\n\nThe concept of the President mistakenly hitting an important button has long been a source for jokes, often somewhat morbidly involving the {{w|nuclear football}}.\n\nThe title text references the typical conclusion to presidential speeches: \"Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America,\" or some variation thereof. As \"goodnight\" is the typical conclusion to a day, the title text jokes that {{w|Barack Obama|President Obama}}, out of habit, has a hard time stopping at goodnight when saying that to his children. It might also be implying that the president that sent the message might actually be Barack Obama.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Television beeping.]\n:Screen reads: \"E.A.S Incoming Presidential Alert\"\n\n:[President of the United States of America in his office is on the television.]\n:My fellow Americans. I, uhhh. Wow.\n\n:Frankly, I didn't realize what this button did. I was just... I mean... \n:I appear before you tonight to, um.\n\n:Look, uhh...\n:Remember to floss regularly. Oral hygiene is important. Thank you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
