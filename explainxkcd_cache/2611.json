These results are shown [[#Result of the Twitter polls|here]].\n\nSee [[#Effects|below]] for explanations for what each of the 16 effects are.\n\nSeveral unrelated scientific effects were previously combined in [[1531: The BDLPSWDKS Effect]], which also included the Stroop effect (the last S).\n\nIn the title text, Randall coins the term \"Stroop-YORP number\" as a count of how many 'casual' references a future publication can sneak into it from the 16 finalist names for cutest effect. It specifies that it should be without the word effect after the words (sans 'effect').\n\nTongue-in-cheek 'counting scores' are familiar in the likes of the {{w|Erdős_number|Erdős}} and {{w|Bacon_number|Bacon}} numbers, both of which are referenced by [[599: Apocalypse]] (the latter only in the title text). In these cases the ideal is to get the ''lowest'' number, whereas here higher is better. The cross-field hybrid {{w|Erdős–Bacon number}} is one in which the desired score is the lowest sum of both values (neither being undefinable) by dint of having participated in both arenas of respective achievement, but not necessarily (or practically) in a single combined presentation.\n\nFor instance the Stroop-YORP number could be high for a wildlife paper. That could possibly use \"butterfly\" and \"rabbit\" (possibly needing the latter to be specifically 'cutaneous', to count), which may both be found in \"little parks\" with some \"popcorn\" seen littered around without too much \"oddity\"; and of course a (Dr.?) \"fox\" could be in the area, getting a score of 6. But other words may be a stretch, with an imaginative reference to a \"woozle\" possibly easier to employ than to evoke anything of the \"nocebo\".\n\nOn the other hand, for a space-science paper there may be more obvious (mis)uses for physics-related terms, and mentioning YORP might well be expected. But it may need creative thinking to introduce the rabbit or the more psychological idea of Stroopicity, etc, without reason to discuss the responses of animal or human payloads being sent there.\n\nIt is not actually obvious whether Randall intends the score to only be valid if the insertions are off-field and/or undetected, such as when someone is wagered that they can slip unrelated song lyrics or a 'hello' to {{w|Jason Isaacs}} into a public speech without the rest of the audience twigging.\n\nA search of google scholar indicates many articles with a score of 2 (e.g. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2012.714435 this paper], which refers to butterfly shaped popcorn), but 3 or more seems to not be attested.\n\n==Effects==\n;{{w|YORP effect}}: The YORP effect is the effect of sunlight on an asteroid with variations of shape and/or albedo, which can increase its rotation rate and/or modify its axis of rotation. It can cause objects to eventually spin apart or drastically change their orbit.\n:It is an acronym of the names Yarkovsky, O’Keefe, Radzievskii and Paddack, who were instrumental in its discovery. More than a century ago, Yarkovsky determined that heat applied to a symmetrical rotating body would be asymmetrically re-emitted and apply a small but continuous thrust, and this was added to by considering the forces to non-symmetrical bodies.\n;{{w|Nocebo effect}}: An effect in which a recipient of medication who believes that it will have negative side-effects is more likely to experience those negative side-effects, whether they can be really caused by the medication or not. Opposite of the {{w|placebo effect}}, which focuses on positive side-effects that arise beyond the true efficacy of a given treatment.\n:''Nocēbō'' is Latin for “I shall harm”, coined to oppose ''placēbō'', “I shall please”.\n;{{w|Woozle effect}}:  If a study gets repeatedly cited and otherwise disseminated, then people will start to believe it regardless of whether it has any evidence behind it. And if there is not  any evidence, it becomes an urban myth.\n:Named after a Winnie-the-Pooh story in which Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet try to catch an imaginary animal called a woozle, and accidentally follow their own tracks in circles.\n:A similar effect was discussed in [[978: Citogenesis]], wherein a sourceless statement on Wikipedia can become apparently credible via simple repetition.\n;{{w|Stroop effect}}:  The Stroop effect (referenced in [[1531: The BDLPSWDKS Effect]]) is a psychological phenomenon in which incongruent or confusing stimuli cause a delayed reaction or response.  It is classically demonstrated using words written in different colors.  It is easier to name the visual color of a word when the word refers to its own color, rather than when the word refers to a different color; i.e. the fact that saying that '''<span style=\"color: red;\">Red</span>''' is red is easier than to say that '''<span style=\"color: darkgreen\">Blue</span>''' is green.\n:Named after {{w|John Ridley Stroop}}.\n;{{w|Pockels effect}}:  A phenomenon where an electric field passed through a medium can cause the medium's refractive index to depend upon the polarization and propagation direction of the refracted light, a property known as {{w|birefringence}}.\n:Named after {{w|Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels}}.\n;{{w|Cheerios effect}}:  A phenomenon where objects floating in a liquid appear to attract or repel each other.\n:Named after the cereal Cheerios, which are an everyday demonstration of this phenomenon because many eat Cheerios in a bowl of milk.{{citation needed}}\n;{{w|Hot chocolate effect}}:  A phenomenon where the sound created by tapping a cup of hot liquid rises in pitch as a soluble powder is added.\n;{{w|Perky effect}}:  An experiment in which participants were asked to visualize an object while staring at a screen on which the outline of that object was subtly projected. Participants believed the projected shape to be only a product of their imaginations.\n:Named after {{w|Cheves Perky}}.\n;{{w|Bouba/kiki effect}}:  An observation that people, despite different native languages, will relatively consistently assign names with certain sounds to blobby or spiky shapes, suggesting the association of sound and shape is non-arbitrary. ''Bouba'' and ''kiki'' were two of the words used in the experiment.\n;{{w|Cutaneous rabbit effect}}:  A phenomenon where, when tapped on one part of the body in rapid succession and then switching to another, the subject feels the tapping at locations in between the two.\n:For example, if rapidly tapping the wrist then switching to the elbow, the subject will subjectively feel as if they are being tapped at progressive intervals between the wrist and elbow, when they are not.\n;[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smallfirmeffect.asp Small firm effect]:  An economic theory that small firms usually perform better than larger ones\n;{{w|Little–Parks effect}}:  A phenomenon where a fluctuating magnetic field passed through a superconductor can slightly suppress its superconductivity, inducing small fluctuations in its electrical resistance. Named after William A. Little and Ronald D. Parks.\n:When juxtaposed against the \"small firm effect\", as in the bracket, one might get the impression that it is somehow related to urban architecture or civil engineering.\n;{{w|Dr. Fox effect}}:  A disputed theory that student evaluations of their teachers are likely unreliable, because they are largely based on the teacher's charisma instead of the quality of their content. Named after actor {{w|Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox}}, one of the experimenters of the study. \n;{{w|Oddity effect}}:  A theory that when fish assemble in shoals (large social groups), any that stand out appearance-wise will be attacked by a predator, explaining why shoals tend to have similar-looking members.\n;{{w|Butterfly effect}}:  The butterfly effect is the sensitivity of chaotic systems to small changes in initial conditions. The weather system of Earth is chaotic, and so an arbitrarily small change in air patterns (such as could be caused by the flapping of a butterfly's wing) could ultimately change the weather for the whole world.\n;{{w|Popcorn effect}}:  A phenomenon exhibited by crushed ore placed on a vibrating screen for separation in mineral processing, in which larger particles tend to bounce higher than smaller particles.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A tournament bracket tree is shown with 16 scientific effect names, with 8 on the left and 8 on the right side.
