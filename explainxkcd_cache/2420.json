Green indicates an excellent performance, yellow not ideal, but usable, and red dismal or destroyed. The diagonal is green as it shows the tasks done by the machines they are supposed to be performed by. See [[#Table|table]] below. The comic is similar to [[1890: What to Bring]], [[2813: What To Do]], and [[2963: House Inputs and Outputs]], but those comics do not use yellow or another intermediate color.\n\nPlain salmon fillets can be easily {{w|Dishwasher salmon|cooked in a dishwasher}}, so it is marked \"cooked\", and thus \"cook a frozen dinner\" is only yellow on the dishwasher entry, rather than full red. This might also apply to most other types of fish (trout, which is evolutionarily a type of salmon, was a prior subject for this process), as commercially-prepared frozen dinners tend to be breaded white fish such as cod, mackerel, smelt, etc. for price and logistical reasons (retaining their taste and firmness through the cooking, freezing, thawing and reheating processes). That's if it is not a recipe built around fish, as with a tuna casserole, in which case it is probably entirely subject to whether the whole of the pre-cooked and frozen meal can be sufficiently defrosted and raised to a safe and palatable temperature.\n\nThe stove/oven has three green as it can also cook a microwave frozen dinner, although slower, and can toast bread, again slower than the toaster. It is by far the machine that has the fewest red entries, only one, as it cannot wash clothes. It can also not clean dishes, but it might sterilize them, thus that entry is yellow. It may actually dry the clothes, but is liable to burn them and is therefore yellow.\n\nThe microwave oven can also cook eggs, thus it has two green, the only other than the stove/oven with more than one green.\n\nThe toaster and the washing machines are the only ones without any yellow, and with only one green, for making toast/washing clothes - they are thus the appliances with the fewest other potential uses (zero). The washing machine will at least not destroy the clothes if you try to dry them, but it has the opposite effect, thus still red. The toaster will potentially just make the dirt on the dishes burn harder, and additionally appears to have melted the tines of the fork.\n\nThe title text mentions that it would be theoretically possible to cook eggs in a dryer, but it is not a common use for a dryer.{{Citation needed}} The joke is that it is not called {{w|scrambled eggs}} but tumbled eggs. It also mentions that the dryer has to become hotter than usual for a dryer (maybe dangerously hot for the clothes for it to work). And then the eggs should be cracked and put in an oven bag, that really needs to be tight and well zipped. \n\nThe table displays a diagonal line of greens from top-left to bottom-right, as is typical with a table where the first row option is deliberately compatible with the first column option, the second row with the second column, etc. What is perhaps more interesting is where the non-diagonal greens appear (and, to some extent, the yellows), indicating appliances or uses that are more flexible and range beyond being of a mere one-trick pony.\n\n==Table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #E6C3C3;\"\n!\n! scope=\"col\"| {{w|Toaster}}\n! scope=\"col\"| {{w|Dishwasher}}\n! scope=\"col\"| {{w|Microwave oven|Microwave}}\n! scope=\"col\"| {{w|Washing machine}}\n! scope=\"col\"| {{w|Kitchen stove|Stove/oven}}\n! scope=\"col\"| {{w|Clothes dryer|Dryer}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Make toast\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a toaster's function is to make toast from bread.{{citation needed}}\n| No. A dishwasher would likely turn bread into mush, and the result is unlikely to be edible.\n| No. A microwave could heat up bread, but would not brown the bread and make it crunchy. In this image, it appears that the bread is getting unevenly burnt.\n| No. A washing machine would break the bread into several pieces and is unlikely to be edible.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, toast can be made using a stove or an oven.\n| No. A dryer would burn the bread due to its heat and would break it up into crumbs due to its tumbling.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Wash dishes\n| No. A toaster would not be able to wash dishes and is likely to do nothing to make them clean (again, other than sterilization by heat).  Also, toasters get hot enough to potentially deform or melt metal cutlery, especially since many kinds of cutlery have tines or handles thin enough to fit between the wires of the toaster baskets and come close to or touch the heating elements (which would pose an additional electrocution hazard); this is probably why this scenario is marked red instead of yellow, as the fork in the image appears to have been partially melted by the heat.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a dishwasher's function is to wash dishes.\n| No. A microwave cannot clean dishes, or even sterilize them through exposure to adequate heat, as glass/ceramic or plastic dishes cannot absorb microwave radiation in sufficient quantities to generate heat. Metal cutlery can, but only specially-designed varieties are supposed to be placed into a microwave because metal usually winds up reflecting the microwaves and causing damage to the oven's interior through electrical discharge.\n| No. A washing machine would break the dishes. The pieces would be clean, but unusable as dishes unless more robust than regular crockery.\n|style=\"background-color: #FBF8CE;\"| Maybe, a stove or an oven could theoretically sterilize dishes with high heat (but this would not clean off any stains or stuck food particles).\n| No. Worse than the washing machine, the tumbling of a dryer would thoroughly pulverize porcelain dishes.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Cook a {{w|TV dinner|frozen dinner}}\n| No. A traditional toaster would not be able to cook a frozen dinner. A {{w|toaster oven}} combination would be able to do so (see stove/oven).\n|style=\"background-color: #FBF8CE;\"| Maybe. The fish could be cooked in a dishwasher, however, the rest might not, but this is not a typical use of a dishwasher.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a microwave is normally used to cook a frozen dinner.\n| No. A washing machine would make the dinner soggy and inedible.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a stove or an oven could also be used to cook a frozen dinner. The image shows the dinner being removed from its packaging and placed in a baking pan.\n| No. A dryer would make the frozen dinner inedible due to its tumbling action.\n|-\t\n! scope=\"row\"| Wash clothes\n| No. A toaster would not be able to wash clothes and would instead leave burn marks (and potentially set the clothes on fire, as seen in the image).\n|style=\"background-color: #FBF8CE;\"| Maybe. A dishwasher would be able to get the clothes wet but the washing may be uneven.\n| No. A microwave would just burn the clothes and not do any washing.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a washing machine's function is to wash clothes.\n| No, a stove or an oven would burn the clothes and not do any cleaning.\n|style=\"background-color: #FBF8CE;\"| Maybe. A dryer would heat the clothes and kill germs, but not get any stains out.\n|-\t\n! scope=\"row\"| Cook eggs\n| No. A toaster would not be able to cook eggs. The image seems to show that eggs were cracked directly into the toaster, which causes a large plume of smoke.\n| No. A dishwasher generally cannot cook eggs. However, it does seem that [https://spoonuniversity.com/how-to/5-foods-cook-dishwasher this is plausible to do].\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes. A microwave could be used to cook eggs, {{w|poached egg|poached style}} as shown in the image, or also {{w|scrambled eggs|scrambled}}.\n| No, a washing machine would destroy the eggs.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a stove or an oven is typically used to cook eggs (and other foods).\n| No. A dryer would overheat the eggs and tumble them to shreds.\n|-\t\n! scope=\"row\"| Dry clothes\n| No. A toaster would not be able to dry clothes without leaving burn marks (the heat would get parts of the clothes dry, but is so concentrated that burn marks would appear on the hotter parts while the cooler parts were still wet), although the heat capacity of the water in the wet clothes would at least reduce the chance of actual ignition compared to attempting to clean dry clothes in a toaster (as seen by the shirt in the image \"only\" having burn marks, instead of actual flames).\n| No. A dishwasher would be able to get the clothes wet but would not do any drying.\n|style=\"background-color: #FBF8CE;\"| Maybe. A microwave could (unevenly) get clothes dry.\n| No, a washing machine's function is to wash clothes and would just get the clothes wet. A washing machine's spin cycle could dry clothes to some extent but is not intended to fully wring all the water out of clothes.\n|style=\"background-color: #FBF8CE;\"| Maybe, a stove or an oven could be used to get clothes dry but runs a high risk of burning them, especially on parts that are in contact with metal.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Yes, a dryer's function is to dry clothes after they are washed.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[The comic is laid out like a grid, with usages for common household appliances the left-hand side (Make toast / Wash dishes / Cook a frozen dinner / Wash clothes / Cook eggs / Dry clothes) and appliances for these activities across the top (Toaster / Dishwasher / Microwave / Washing machine / Stove/oven / Dryer).
