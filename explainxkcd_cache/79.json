That could get pretty difficult.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn this part of the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby series]], the hobby is responding to casual questions using {{w|iambic pentameter}}, which is most commonly associated with {{w|William Shakespeare}} and {{w|Shakespearean plays}}. Iambic pentameter is a form of poetic verse defined by the number of syllables per line. In this form, a line contains exactly five (penta means five in Greek) \"{{w|Iamb (foot)|iambs}}\" per line. An iamb is a unit of two syllables with the stress falling on the second. The actual breakup of the words is unimportant; the definition is based solely on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. One line of strict iambic pentameter will have ten syllables, with the stress falling on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and last.\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] (i.e. [[Randall]] - the one with the hobby) is replying to his friend's questions. (The friend also looks like Cueball, but are here differentiated by who has the hobby.) Cueball's responses are each one line of iambic pentameter, just visually broken into two lines for space reasons. They read (adding the emphasis):\n:\"Well, '''I''' can '''meet''' the '''plane''' at '''ten''' of '''six'''\" and \n:\"I'll '''meet''' him '''at''' the '''stairs''' be'''fore''' the '''gate'''\"<div> \nwith a sort of bouncing rhythm.\n\nThis is the \"strict form\" of iambic pentameter. In practice, poets often strayed from the strict count of iambs as the image text suggests. Wikipedia offers two Shakespearian examples being \"Now is the winter of our discontent,\" in which the first iamb is reversed (\"Now\" is stressed rather than \"is\"), and \"To be or not to be, that is the question,\" which adds an extra unstressed syllable at the end. As the comic suggests in the title text, without such exceptions, it can be very difficult to stick to strict iambic pentameter for every sentence.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two identical Cueballs are having a conversation. The latter is identified as Cueball, since he represents Randall who has the Hobby.]\n:Friend: What time can you pick Michael up?\n:Cueball: Well, I can meet the plane at ten of six.\n:Friend: Do you know where to find him?\n:Cueball: I'll meet him at the stairs before the gate.\n:[Below the two Cueballs are the following text:]\n:My hobby: answering casual questions in iambic pentameter.\n\n==Trivia==\nIambs and other types of poetry \"{{w|Foot (prosody)|feet}}\" are the subject of [[1383: Magic Words]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
