He tells about his visit to a military {{w|Aviation museum|aircraft museum}} at the {{w|Military air base|air force base}} and lists some of the things he saw. It starts with things you would expect at a typical museum, such as a mix of aircraft from different eras, before revealing the fact that Cueball was able to watch missiles being loaded, which is something that would be out of place and potentially dangerous at a museum. Realizing this, Cueball remarks that he hopes that he was at a museum, and Megan asks him if he hears helicopters. The implication is that Cueball observed not an aircraft museum, but actual military operations at the base, and the military is now scrambling aircraft; either to pursue Cueball and arrest him, or to deploy for some battle nearby.\n\nThe mention of \"planes from different eras\" alludes to the fact that military aircraft are often still in use after a much longer time than they were originally designed for. An example of this are the US Air Force's {{w|Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52}} bomber, first introduced in 1955 (62 years before the publication of this comic) and expected to serve into the 2040s. Additionally, aircraft museums typically house military aircraft from previous eras, such as from WWII and the Cold War, to show the evolution in aircraft design and to showcase technological advances.\n\nThe title text builds on this premise. [[Randall]] says that he had fun visiting another Air Force \"museum\" near Dover, the capital of Delaware, but he adds that if they don't have a museum (in which case he was trespassing on a military base) then he denies ever having been anywhere near it. Fortunately for Randall, there is in fact an Air Force museum nearby: the {{w|Air Mobility Command Museum}} about half a mile south of the {{w|Dover Air Force Base}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan walks from left over to Cueball.]\n:Megan: How was your day?\n:Cueball: I visited the military aircraft museum over at the Air Force base. It was really neat!\n\n:[Both walking together to the right.]\n:Cueball: They have planes from different eras, all kinds of cool equipment, and you can even watch missiles being loaded.\n\n:[Beat frameless panel. Cueball and Megan walking.]\n\n:[Both still walking.]\n:Cueball: ...at least, I ''hope'' that was a museum.\n:Megan: Do you hear helicopters?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
