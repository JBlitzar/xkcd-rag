It conspicuously excludes a number of more modern songs that seem ubiquitous, but this is because those songs do not appear on the ASCAP list.\n\n\"Popular release\" in this context means release to the general public, not the version of the song which is most popular.\n\nThe {{w|Postâ€“World War II baby boom|Baby Boomers}} were born in a period of time after {{w|World War II|the second World War}} when medical advances meant that infant mortality rates were low but common birth control methods were not very effective.\n\nThe data appears to come from [http://www.ascap.com/press/2009/1123_holidays_songs.aspx an ASCAP survey conducted in 2009].\n\nThe title text points out that many \"traditions\" actually have no historical precedent, they're just routines that have been spread by lots of people. The Baby Boomers, since they made up a ''huge'' fraction of the US population, were able to accidentally ground many \"traditions\" that their parents made up in American society just by consensus among themselves.\n\n==Transcript==\n:The 20 most-played Christmas songs (2000-2009 radio airplay) by decade of popular release\n:[A bar chart labeled on the X-axis with the decades \"1900s\" through \"2000s\" labeled.
