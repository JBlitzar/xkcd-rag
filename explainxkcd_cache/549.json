In the present she is considered one of the most beautiful women of the land and so is being married off to a prince. To provoke a war she has been kidnapped by mercenaries, one of whom is a very honorable Spanish swordsman named Inigo Montoya. A man claiming to be the Dread Pirate Roberts rescues her. On verifying his identity as Roberts, she attacks him by pushing him down a hill. While tumbling down the hill he shouts back \"as you wish\" identifying him as her first love. She tumbles after, landing on top of him as in the start of this comic.\n\nThere are, however, several \"dick moves\" Westley must have made in order for the film's narrative to make sense.\n# He took over as the Dread Pirate Roberts becoming a pirate and therefore not respectable, killing people, sacking ports, and looting ships for a living. \n# Over the last five years, Westley has allowed Buttercup to believe that he'd been murdered, apparently cutting off their burgeoning relationship of mutual attraction.\n\nWestley breaks the fourth wall and claims he did all of these things for the sake of the {{w|narrative}}. In other words, he did it to make the story better. \nIn the comic Buttercup realizes that Westley has behaved like a dick and chooses to give her love to Inigo Montoya. But in the movie, Westley and Buttercup end up together in spite of this behavior!\n\nThe title text shows what looks like a message she and Inigo have written together, for instance in a heart on a tree. Inigo is the Spaniard referred to by Buttercup. Their names, then forever (4eva) and a heart (smiley heart = \"<3\"), implying they did end up together according to this version of the story.  Alternatively, it could simply be the narrator expressing his wish that this will come to pass.\n\nIt is not the first time [[Randall]] has referenced this movie, as the Dread Pirate was referenced in [[345: 1337: Part 5]], and a quote from this movie is in the title text of [[1427: iOS Keyboard]]. So it seems like a film that has some meaning for Randall.\n\nNote: It's quite possible Westley hasn't been killing people as a pirate at all.  People had been surrendering to The Dread Pirate Roberts without a fight for years before he took over the role, due to the terror of his name. Of course, there may be a few people who needed to be killed, over the years, but the implication in the book (and movie) is that at least most surrender without a fight and are presumably unharmed.\n\nIf you haven't seen the movie or read the book, you may find it helpful to read the synopsis of the book {{w|The_Princess_Bride_(novel)#Plot|here}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A girl (Buttercup) with long hair and a man (Westley) looking like Cueball but with a bandana lies at the foot of a high cliff. There is a forest in the background]\n:Buttercup: Oh, my sweet Westley!\n\n:[Buttercup sits on her knees, Westley takes off his bandana.]\n:Buttercup: Why did you let me think you were dead?\n:Westley: You shacked up with the prince!\n:Buttercup: After years of mourning! The worst pain of my life!\n\n:[Buttercup stands up looking down on Westley who still sits with the bandana in his hand.]\n:Buttercup: And now you ... kill people?\n:Westley: I'd hardly be a dread pirate if I didn't.\n:Buttercup: How lovable.\n\n:[Westley stands with the bandana in hand while Buttercup walks away from him.]\n\n:Westley: It was for the sake of the narrative!\n:Buttercup: Fuck the narrative. I'm going to go see if that Spaniard's single.\n:Westley: ...As you wish.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]"
