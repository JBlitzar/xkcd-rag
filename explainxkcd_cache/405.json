He then proceeds to silently scorn the person once they give him any kind of reassurance.\n\nIn [[377: Journal 2]], however, [[Danish]] sees through his ruse. She counteracts it by proving that she understands him, and attempts to resign him to the fact that he will never see her again, thus stripping him of the satisfaction and confidence of a proper social connection. She decamps, abducting his hat in the process. (We also explored the fact that she might be even better than Black Hat. But Black Hat shows his true power and ingeniosity.)\n\nInitially vanquished, Black Hat seems to have recovered and tracked Danish down, even to the extreme fringes of the Earth. He tells Danish that although she was able to read him impossibly adequately she blundered one \"inconsequential\" detail. We are led to believe that this is some mistake in the disguising of her tracks, but then he explains that it was simply how much he values his hat. It may also be the possibility that Black Hat placed a tracking device of some sort on his hat. This way he trampolines her wrath back at her. She thought that he would agonise the loss of her - the only person who understands him - but he subdues her ego when claiming that he likes his hat (implicitly saying that he doesn't care for her). The series continues in [[432: Journal 4]]. He leaves, taking â€œher hat\" from her.\n\nThe title text continues the theme of Black Hat's supernatural ability to troll and to deftly dodge the consequences: If Black Hat stole a military submarine, said military is probably going to be hot on his tail, but he writes it off with: \"just tell them it was always here,\" as if it is no big deal. Black Hat will even be blamed for stealing the submarine in [[496: Secretary: Part 3]]. However, since this is (presumably) the American Senate reviewing him, it may be that he simply has stolen two submarines. It is also possible that the submarine is the American submarine and the title text refers to the Russian Government because their current location is in their territory, and he is shifting any reason for the submarine being there away from himself.\n\nIt perhaps may be significant that this comic includes the line \"So, you found me after all\", given that the previous comic number [[404: Not Found]] was skipped, leading instead to an HTTP 404 Not Found error page.\nThe destiny of Black Hat is fully known in [[:Category:Journal|The Journal]].\n\nThe whole \"[[:Category:Journal|Journal]]\" story is:\n*[[374: Journal]]\n*[[377: Journal 2]]\n*[[405: Journal 3]]\n*[[432: Journal 4]]\n*[[433: Journal 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two women ice-skating outside.]\n:Ponytail: Wait up!\n:Danish (wearing Black Hat's Hat): Skate faster!\n\n:[Danish sees cracking ice.]\n:''Crack Crack''\n\n:[Danish on chunk of ice broken off.]\n:''Crack Rumble''\n\n:[Submarine dorsal fin emerging.]\n:''AWOOGA''\n\n:[Black Hat (without hat) coming out of hatch.]\n:''CREAK''\n:Black Hat: Hi.\n\n:Black Hat: That's my hat you're wearing.\n\n:Danish (wearing Black Hat's Hat(stolen in [[Journal 2]])): So, you found me after all.\n:Black Hat (out of frame): You didn't make it easy.\n\n:Black Hat: You saw through me, all right.
