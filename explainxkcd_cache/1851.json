It's so straightforward physicists add \"relativistic\" or \"quantum\" just to keep it from getting boring.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nIn this comic, [[Ponytail]] explains to [[Cueball]] that the Sun's atmosphere is a super hot {{w|Plasma (physics)|plasma}} controlled by \"{{w|magnetohydrodynamics}}\" (a real word), the study of magnetic properties of electrically conducting fluids. This is true, as plasma is both electrically charged (following the laws of electrodynamics) and a fluid (following the laws of hydrodynamics). However, the combination is so difficult for Cueball that he finds it easier to comprehend any statements containing the word \"magnetohydrodynamic\" by dropping the central part of the word (\"netohydrodynam\"). Thus, he pretends that Ponytail instead said \"The Sun's atmosphere is a superhot plasma governed by ''magic'' forces\". If Cueball really thinks that magic is more comprehensible than magnetohydrodynamics, then considering just how vaguely and inconsistently magic is portrayed across fiction, that must mean that magnetohydrodynamics is really, ''really'' hard!{{Citation needed}}\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] riffs on the nature of two different types of equations. It suggests that {{w|Maxwell's equations}} are intuitive (this is not how they are considered) and that {{w|Navierâ€“Stokes equations}} are trivial to solve (also far from true, being a {{w|Millennium Prize Problems|prizeworthy problem}}). The suggestion being that magnetohydrodynamics is both intuitive and comes with easy solutions (based upon the other assertions, one can safely assume that the chances of such are low). But physicists, it is purported, like to 'spice up' anything that is too mundane, with words commonly encountered when discussing {{w|quantum mechanics}} and the {{w|theory of relativity}}. This also leaves us with the possibility that even these two fields are littered with the buzzwords we all know and love just to make them 'seem less boring than they are'.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail holding her hands up is facing Cueball and Megan .]\n:Ponytail: The Sun's atmosphere is a superhot plasma governed by magnetohydrodynamic forces...\n:Cueball: Ah, yes, of course.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Whenever I hear the word \"magnetohydrodynamic\" my brain just replaces it with \"magic.\"\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the title text, \"Magnetohydrodynamics\" was misspelled as \"Magnetohydrody'''an'''mics\".
