The \"editor's note\" tells you to save a copy of the image to \"view the full comic\".\n\nTo save an image from a browser most people would right-click on it (or long-click in mobile devices) which normally leads to a \"context menu\" allowing several actions related to the image, including saving/downloading. This is what you are encouraged to do by the editorial note as well as by the comic name and title text. However, the context menu opened is not the default context menu of the browser but an elaborate context menu containing many nonsensical options.\n\nAt first it also seems impossible to save the image using that menu. However, after exploring the context menu you can find an \"easter egg\" in one of two different places (see below) which unlocks the save option. This save option gives you a different [https://xkcd.com/1975/v6xso1_right_click_save.png image] than the one you see, which can be thought of as \"the full comic\" although the meat of the comic is actually in the interactive context menu itself. Note that \"cheating\" by disabling JavaScript and other methods that allow you to directly save the image won't get you that \"full comic\" image.\n\nThis comic pokes fun at how hard it can be to save an image or to just navigate context menus in some computer programs. The \"easter egg hunt\" might be related to the fact the comic was released during Easter (which fell on April fool's in 2018). It might also be related to the movie \"Ready Player One\" which was recently released when the comic was released. In the movie, based on the book by Cline, finding an \"easter egg\" in a VR world was a central plot point.\n\nThe title is reminiscent of one of the first interactive comics [[1110: Click and Drag]], where the title explains what the user should do to experience it. However, that was not a fools' day comic.\n\nThe comic uses {{w|JavaScript}} and {{w|HTML5}} to override the standard context menu. Since modern browsers use the same features to integrate Add-ons into that menu, the behavior may be different depending on the browser environment.  Browsers with JavaScript disabled, either totally or by using {{w|NoScript}}, won't access the functionality of the comic, but of course can easily save the image (not \"the full version\" but the image that is seen initially).\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n\n==Context menu== \n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=5 class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! # !!

The first, 'computer', has two options ('folder' and 'menus'), which link back to the 'find' and right-click menus, respectively. \"Narnia\" leads to a link to the comic [[665: Prudence]] as well as to a grey comment about how it's weird that \"they\" have to die to go back to Narnia.\n\"Canada\" and \"America\" lead to the same set of bizarre menus (America leads into Canada's menu), which then give the options 'Upper' and 'Lower', ultimately leading to a drive-through and hockey, respectively.\n\n'When' leads to a description of Siri entering someone's home, and the menu can be followed to reveal several further events from 'earlier' in the day.

This command would attempt to install <code>/dev/null</code> (which is a device, not a package!) or, more correctly, would try to install a package reading its data from <code>/dev/null</code> (if <code>apt-get</code> is given a file name it tries to interpret it as a .deb package), which is obviously impossible.\n* <code>brew install apt-get</code>: <code>brew</code> is a third-party package manager for macOS; it is generally used to install \"missing\" open-source utilities on a macOS system; the command is attempting to install the aforementioned <code>apt-get</code>, which is both impossible (<code>apt-get</code> doesn't run on macOS) and hilariously recursive (did you install a package manager - brew - to install another one?). Even if this were possible, the package would have been called <code>apt</code>, as apt-get is only one of the commands in the package manager.\n* <code>/usr/local/bin/wine xen-hypervisor.exe</code>: <code>wine</code> is a compatibility layer used to run Windows executables on Linux (and on macOS); the fact that it is in <code>/usr/local</code> hints that it has been manually compiled on this machine; Xen is a Linux-based hypervisor, i.e. a software used to run and manage virtual machines over a Linux host, but the .exe suffix here hints that it is a Windows executable. The command would try to launch a Windows build of a Linux-based virtual machine manager on a Unix machine through a Windows emulation layer (wine).\n* <code>source .bash_history</code>: the <code>source</code> shell command reads the file that is given as argument and executes each of its rows as a command in the current shell, roughly as if you typed them in; <code>.bash_history</code> (located in the user home directory) is the file where the bash shell saves the history of the commands that have been run. This command would re-run all the commands that have been typed in the shell.\n* <code>rm -rf $DIRECTROY/*</code>: <code>rm -rf</code> deletes recursively and forcefully the paths it is given as arguments; <code>$DIRECTROY</code> is a shell variable, probably containing some directory that whoever typed in this command wanted to clean; however, it is misspelled (it says <code>$DIRECTROY</code>, not <code>$DIRECTORY</code>), and, due to how POSIX shell work, it is thus expanded to an empty string; so, the command becomes <code>rm -rf /*</code>, which deletes all the files and directories in the root of the disk, effectively killing the system instead of just deleting the content of some directory. Notice that this particular misspell manages to circumvent the builtin protection of many <code>rm</code> versions, which refuse to do a plain <code>rm -rf /</code>, as <code>/*</code> gets expanded by the shell, so <code>rm</code> never has the chance to see explicitly that you are killing all the data in the root directory.\n* <code>:(){:|:&};:</code>: this is [https://askubuntu.com/q/159491/208527 a classic shell fork bomb], i.e. a small program that keeps launching copies of itself until all resources have been exhausted or the user somehow manages to kill all its copies.\n* <code>echo \"source .bashrc\" >> .bashrc</code>: <code>.bashrc</code> is a file that gets executed whenever the <code>bash</code> shell is started in interactive mode; this command appends the string <code>source .bashrc</code> to it, which effectively executes it again recursively; this would pretty much make it impossible to open an interactive shell when launching it with the default parameters.\n* <code>alias gcc=php</code>: the <code>alias</code> shell builtin create an alias for another command; <code>gcc</code> is the GNU C compiler driver, which is used to compile programs written in the C language; <code>php</code> is the command-line interpreter for the PHP language. This line creates an alias such that when typing <code>gcc</code>, <code>php</code> is actually invoked, which would generate completely absurd error messages. This is doubly devious, as PHP isn't generally held in high esteem by large part of the programming community (especially by someone writing stuff in C).\n\n* <code>'); DROP TABLE Menus;--</code> links to [[327: Exploits of a Mom]]\n|-\n! 7 \n| '''Games''' \n| Normal submenu \n| Twenty Questions> A Twenty Questions interface that gets really confusing.

The game also contains some extremely large cans of creamed corn (a reference to [[1807: Listening]]).\n\nRock Paper Scissors> A Rock Paper Scissors game where the computer always matches your move. If you go long enough, the Defect option is added, a reference to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma Prisoner's Dilemma].\n\nD&D> An interface that allows you to \"cast\" over 300 spells from {{W|Dungeons_&_Dragons|D&D}} 5e. Several menus are used to filter the spells based on their traits: class which can learn the spell, the school of the spell, the spell level, and components required to perform it (somatic, vocal, material). The traits can be chosen in any order. After all six traits are chosen a submenu opens with all of the spells that match those exact traits (which might be no spells at all).\n\nMost spells link to various pages, including xkcd comics (e.g. [[1331: Frequency]]), what-ifs (e.g. {{what if|144|Saliva Pool}}) and other external sites (e.g. [https://www.nasa.gov/sun The Sun | NASA]). Some spells create effects that change the comic page temporarily or permanently, and some open submenus from different parts of the context menu.\n\nSee [[#D&D spells|below]] for all links and effects.\n\nADVENT.EXE> A text-based adventure game. If played correctly, you can win, unlocking 'Save'>'Save image' from the beginning menu, which links to [https://xkcd.com/1975/v6xso1_right_click_save.png]. \n\nThe first scene allows you a choice between exploring a dark cave or a castle. If you explore the cave first you get the following description: \"It's pitch black. You're likely to be eaten by a grue\". This is a reference to a text adventure game called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork Zork], where [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_(monster) Grues] are monsters who dwell in the dark and eat human explorers, making it impossible to explore dark areas. The same description often appears when you enter a dark area without a light source in Zork and other related games. This has previously been mentionned in [[91: Pwned]].\n\nIf you ignore the warning and go deeper, you are given one more warning (\"You're deep in a cave. Something, possibly this very sentence, tells you it would be dangerous to go any further\"). If you ignore that too and keep going, you fall into a pit. Several options are given to try and rescue yourself (or alternatively \"resign to your fate\" or deny you are in a pit [You also may try to cause a distraction by saying \"Look behind you! A three-headed monkey!\" This may be a reference to the Curse of Monkey Island, where Guybrush Threepwood distracts characters by saying the same line.]) but all lead to \"you've been eaten by a grue\". Being eaten by a grue seems to be an irreversible condition - if you exit the context menu and enter ADVENT.EXE again, you are given no options and are told again that \"you've been eaten by a grue\". Apparently only refreshing the page cancels that.\n\nExploring the castle is a much safer option to begin with. The main castle scene has a door, a well, and stairs that go up to the tower. The door is locked, and trying to break it is futile.\n\nThe well is a wishing well. Examining it allows for several options:\n* Examine the sign - it reads \"Dark! Narrow! Scary! Well of Three Features\". This is a reference to [https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Bottom_of_the_Well the well of three features] from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\n* Wish for... - this one has a lot of options, some of which are links to comics or What If pages and some lead to further submenus:\n** World peace - leads to the answer \"I'm just a well, can you scale it down a bit?\" and then back to the well menu; this option is from now changed to \"Inner peace\", which gives \"A feeling of calm washes over you.\" and \"Ommmmmm...\", which also goes back to the well menu\n** More wishes - leads back to the \"Wish for...\" menu. The idea of using a wish to wish for more wishes is common when discussing things with wish-granting powers and was previously mentioned in [[1086: Eyelash Wish Log]].\n** Fewer wishes - Tell you \"Really? Okay..\" (as this is not something most people would ask for{{Citation needed}}). If you continue you return to the \"Examine well\" menu. If you want to make a wish again (even after exiting the menu and coming back again) you can only wish for \"more wishes\" and then you can continue wishing normally.\n** Happiness - links to [[572: Together]], a comic about getting \"happiness\" as a scavenger hunt item.\n** Luck - links to [[1053: Ten Thousand]] which refers to hearing about commonly known things for the first time as being one of \"today's lucky 10,000\".\n** Wisdom - You hear a voice whisper 'N, E, N, N, N, W, S, W'. This is a clue for later.\n** Wealth - Links to the what if article {{what if|111|All the Money}}, which might explain what will happen if the wishing well \"overgrants\" your wish.\n** A human-sized hamster ball - links to [[152: Hamster Ball]] where [[Cueball]] wishes for the same thing.\n** A map of everything - links to [[1196: Subways]], a map of the subways of North America, which are apparently \"everything\" for Americans.\n** True love - links to {{what if|9|Soul Mates}}.\n** A kitty! - links to [[231: Cat Proximity]], a comic detailing the effect of cats on humans.\n* Jump in - Allows you to swim (and later \"just keep swimming...\" indefinitely) or climb out and return to the \"Examine well\" menu.\n* Pull up the bucket - \"You reel in the bucket. There's something shiny in the bottom\". If you examine the bucket you get a key!\n\nAfter you have the key, if you go back to the castle you can now use the key on the locked door and enter a dungeon. In the dungeon, there is a clamp on a table that you can take.\n\nFinally, in the tower, you can find a \"strange machine\" dubbed a \"C-Remover\". You can try to use the C-Remover on any item you got. It doesn't affect the key, but it does turn the clamp into a lamp! The C-remover is a reference to either the T-remover from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_Goddesses_of_Phobos Leather Goddess of Phobos] or the multi-letter remover from [http://emshort.com/counterfeit_monkey/ Counterfeit Monkey], a text adventure by Emily Short inspired by it.\n\nAfter you have the lamp, entering the cave becomes safer. It now becomes \"a maze of twisty passages, all alike\" where each room allows going N, E, S, or W, normally leading to an identical room. Only by using the clue from the wish for \"wisdom\" in the well and going N, E, N, N, N, W, S, W you can navigate the maze successfully. When following that path, after the first \"W\" the options become N, S, and Dennis instead of the usual N, E, S, W; this is a reference to the text-based game [http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Thy_Dungeonman Thy Dungeonman] found in a Strong Bad email from [http://homestarrunner.com homestarrunner.com].\n\nIf you follow the full path you find the center of the maze where there is a nest with a \"large multicolored egg\" (an easter egg!). If you take the egg you are told \"You feel a sense of potential, as if you may have more options now\". This is because the \"save\" options are now unlocked in the main context menu and the file menu!\n\nHoverboard> Links to [[1608: Hoverboard]] browser game.\n\nMornington Crescent> This is a simulation of the well-known game {{W|Mornington_Crescent_(game)|Mornington Crescent}}, which bears a surprising resemblance to {{W|London_Underground|London's Underground}} railway network. Players name a station, in turn, endeavoring to reach Mornington Crescent. The rules of play are very complicated and beyond the scope of this article; interested persons are referred to ''N. F. Stovold’s Mornington Crescent: Rules and Origins'' (sadly out of print). This variation only includes the sections of the London Underground in fare zone 1. There is a \"station\" only connected to Vauxhall called \"Easter basket\". The Easter basket leads you to \"Take egg\", also allowing you to save.  The shortest path to the Easter basket is Euston > Warren Street > Oxford Circus > Green Park > Victoria > Pimlico > Vauxhall > Easter basket, simply following the Victoria Line the entire way. All playable stations are immediately adjacent on the London Underground network to the station last played. Despite the fact that this version of the game starts at Euston, which is adjacent to Mornington Crescent, as Mornington Crescent is in fare zone 2, the branch of the {{W|Northern_line|Northern line}} on which the {{W|Mornington_Crescent_tube_station|eponymous station}} is situated does not appear in the game and Mornington Crescent is not an objective.\n|-\n! 8 \n| '''Help''' \n| Contains various submenus, all of which, barring Credits, loop back recursively to this menu:\n|Tutorial\nSupport\n\nManual\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nFAQ\n\nGuide\n\nQ&A\n\nUser forums\n\n--------------\n\nCredits> 'Some people who helped with this comic: \n[http://chromakode.com/ @chromakode] \n[https://twitter.com/aiiane Amber] \n[https://twitter.com/fadinginterest @fadinginterest] \n[https://twitter.com/wirehead2501 Kat] \n[https://twitter.com/cotrone Kevin] \n[http://90d.ca/ Stereo]'\n|-\n! 9\n| '''Do Crimes'''\n| Contains several \"crimes\" that can be committed.

Zone of Truth\n| 2\n| Bard, Cleric, Paladin\n| Enchantment\n| V, S\n| http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone\n| A reference to the Adventure Zone podcast by the McElroy family, specifically the character Merle Highchurch, who is well known for using this spell in possibly unhelpful situations. \n|}\n\n====Submenu Spells====\nThese 9 spells all appear with an arrow and open submenus when hovered on. The submenus are all actually from different parts of the context menu. Several of the spells are \"teleportation/transportation\" related which might explain why they lead you to a different place in the menu.\n\n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=5 class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Name !! Level !! Classes !! School !! Components !! Effect !! Explanation\n|-\n! Acid Splash\n| 0\n| Sorcerer, Wizard\n| Conjuration\n| V, S\n| Causes the background to change color between red, yellow, chartreuse, blue, fuchsia, and blue-violet randomly every 300ms.\n| Using LSD ('acid') often causes vibrant colors to 'splash' and swivel around one's visual field.\n|-\n! Animate Objects\n| 5\n| Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard\n| Transmutation\n| V, S\n| Causes most parts of the page to begin shifting in place randomly every 100ms.\n| The parts, or \"objects\" on the page are being \"animated\".\n|-\n! Blur\n| 2\n| Sorcerer, Wizard\n| Illusion\n| V\n| Causes the comic and most text to blur.\n| Largely self-explanatory. In D&D, the Blur spell blurs one's body to make it harder to hit. This one blurs the elements on the page.\n|-\n! Conjure Animals\n| 3\n| Druid, Ranger\n| Conjuration\n| V, S\n| Adds a rabbit image of a random size next to the comic.\n| Conjures an image of an animal.\n|-\n! Darkness\n| 2\n| Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard\n| Evocation\n| V, M \n| Causes the comic to disappear and the background to turn black.\n| In D&D, the Darkness spell conjures darkness. This does largely the same thing.\n|-\n! Darkvision\n| 2\n| Sorcerer, Wizard, Druid, Ranger\n| Transmutation\n| V, S, M \n| Causes the background to turn gray and the comic to fade. However, it does not appear to work.\n| \n|-\n! Fireball\n| 3\n| Sorcerer, Wizard\n| Evocation\n| V, S, M \n| Causes the page background to turn red then slowly turn white.\n| Fireballs caused by nuclear weapons generally appear reddish-white.\n|-\n! Mirror Image\n| 2\n| Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard\n| Illusion\n| V, S\n| Causes the entire page to be mirrored on the vertical axis.\n| Here, Mirror Image \"mirrors\" the image, instead of conjuring \"mirror images\" of yourself.\n|-\n! Symbol\n| 7\n| Bard, Cleric, Wizard\n| Abjuration\n| V, S, M \n| Changes all text on the page to use Wingdings, Webdings, Symbol, or Zapf Dingbats.\n| These are all {{w|dingbat}} fonts which replace text with symbols.\n|-\n! Time Stop\n| 9\n| Sorcerer, Wizard\n| Transmutation\n| V\n| Pauses any currently ongoing effects. (But does not cancel them)\n| Time Stop is a spell that stops time. This would make sense to stop ongoing effects.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Empty frame with Cueball standing slightly right of center.]\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:Editor's Note: Today's comic is optimized for local viewing.
