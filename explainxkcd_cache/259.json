The typical response to \"O RLY\" is usually \"YA RLY,\" \"NO WAI,\" or \"SRSLY?\" These exchanges are memetic variations of \"Oh really?\", \"Yeah really,\" \"No way!\", and \"Seriously?\" respectively. However, [[Cueball]]'s response avoids this typical exchange, instead replying with another cliché, derived from a classic double entendre. In this cliché, the speaker responds to a statement containing a word ending with '-er' and turns it into a sexual reference. The setup is as follows:\n\n: '''Alice:''' ''\"Do you want to come over to my house? My wife and I are playing poker.\"''\n: '''Bob:''' ''\"Poker? I hardly KNOW her!\"''\n\nHere, the double entendre is that Bob hears Alice's message as an invitation to 'poke her'.\n\nSuch a double entendre makes no sense in the context of an O RLY exchange. In the case of the comic, the non-sequitur will likely baffle the person setting up the meme and derail the conversation, to the amusement of the replying person. The reason [[Randall]] makes this a hobby is, presumably, that it bores him when people fall back on clichés for comedy, and he seeks inventive ways to humor himself in these situations. This view has already been expressed early in [[16: Monty Python -- Enough]].\n\nThe title text takes the real clichés \"it's like they say\" and \"fight fire with fire\" and combines it with the more literal \"fight clichés with clichés.\" The resulting statement follows a very similar principle to the situation in the comic proper.\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby:\n:Derailing clichéd exchanges by using the wrong replies\n\n:Friend: O RLY?\n:Cueball: O RLY?
