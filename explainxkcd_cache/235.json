In real life, of course, the string would not be able to support the weight of a human.{{Citation needed}} Up in the sky, [[Megan]] appears hanging on a blimp, looking at him throughout the encounter. Cueball wonders about her and considers talking to her, but he does not act. After she has gone, Cueball is alone again; nothing has changed.\n\nThe title text explains the meaning of this metaphor. It is easy to regret an awkward conversation you had. In contrast, you don't regret the conversations you didn't have the nerve to start, because their cost is invisible--yet, they may have been missed opportunities, possibly a much higher cost than a simple awkward conversation.\n\nLater in the [[1614: Kites]] title text, it turns out that other people ([[Beret Guy]]) can also fly with a kite.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball readies a kite.]\n:[Cueball starts to fly the kite.]\n:[Cueball continues to fly the kite.]\n:[Cueball ties the kite string to a tree.]\n:[Cueball grabs the string.]\n:[Cueball starts to climb the string.]\n:[A scene showing Cueball holding onto the string at a high altitude, against a color backdrop of the ground, clouds, water, and the sky.]\n:[Black and white again.
