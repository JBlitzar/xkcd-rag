In this case, the scale of 1 to 10 is using binary, so in decimal it would be a scale of 1 to 2. Since 4 in binary is \"100\" it doesn't fit into the range \"1\" to \"10\" in a binary system. And [[Megan]] doesn't even know the number \"4\" because she's only working on the binary system, this character does not exist for her.\n\nIt is also possible that Megan is using base-3 or base-4, both of which don't have a 4 (base-3 counts 1, 2, 10, etc., and base 4 counts 1, 2, 3, 10 etc.)\n\nIt should be noted that if Megan is speaking out loud in such a way that confuses Cueball, she would be saying \"ten\" out loud; this would automatically indicate she is indeed using base-10 (or higher). The correct pronunciation of \"10\" in base-2 is \"one zero\", so [[Megan]] is lying to [[Cueball]].\n\nThe title text uses a similar joke. Since test scores are usually written as either a letter grade or a percentage, 11 correct questions out of 100 would be a failing score in decimal notation. However, 11/100 in binary translates to 3/4 in decimal, which would be 75%, accepted in most classes as a 'C' grade.\n\nIt could also be argued that a score of 11 should count as a \"B\", as 11 is B in hexadecimal; however, this link is a bit more tenuous, as the whole score would then be interpreted as \"B/64\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:Megan: On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely is it that this question is using binary?\n:Cueball: ...4?\n:Megan: What's a 4?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n\n[[Category:Binary]]"
