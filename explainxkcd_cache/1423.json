Megan has probably been dreading this question, because she answers that her free time activity consists of trying to figure out how to respond if asked what she does in her free time. Cueball answers soothingly, but Megan's {{w|anxiety}} gets the better of her and she leaves abruptly.\n\nDuring Megan speaking, Cueball finished all of his drink. He may have been surprised by the reply, and Megan sensing this contributes to her leaving.\n\nThe title text implies that she also spends her free time wondering what to write in her {{w|diary}} (with no success).\n\nBoth the comic and the title text are examples of self-referential humor. Megan recognises that she spends her free time thinking what to say about her free time, so she must spend some of that free time thinking about her thinking about her free time. Such self-referential loops are often disturbing, since they contain within them potential for {{w|infinite regression}}. On the other hand, there is a simple way to exit the loop before any recursion: Megan ''has already decided'' what to say when asked what she does in her free time, and she ''has'' figured out what to write in her diary. But on realising this, Megan would have to find something else to occupy her free time, such as going on a date.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are sitting at a table with drinks.]\n:Cueball: So, what do you do in your free time?\n\n:[Close up on Megan's face.]\n:Megan: Mostly I sit around worrying someone will ask me that, and try to think of a good answer.\n\n:[Back to original shot.]\n:Cueball: That's not a bad answer.\n:Megan: It's all I've got. Now that it's done, I should go. Bye!\n:[She gets up and leaves.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
