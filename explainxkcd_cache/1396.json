In the opening question, \"Who are today's 10 hottest actors?\" the word \"hottest\" would typically refer to an actor's popularity, success, demand, or attractiveness. Cueball and Megan interpret the word \"hottest\" as asking them to list the 10 actors who have the highest surface temperature, and we see them measuring \"Justin's\" (possibly referring to {{w|Justin Long|Long}}, {{w|Justin Theroux|Theroux}}, {{w|Justin Bieber|Bieber}} or {{w|Justin Timberlake|Timberlake}} or [http://www.imdb.com/search/name?count=100&gender=male&name=justin&sort=starmeter,asc any of the several other \"Justin\"s in show business]) surface temperature using an {{w|infrared thermometer}} (the thermometer typically has a laser pointer to know the approximate location where the radiometric temperature comes from). The measured temperature of 81.5 is presumably reported in degrees {{w|Fahrenheit}}, corresponding to 27.5 {{w|°C}}. This temperature is below the {{w|Human_body_temperature|average human internal body temperature}} of 98.6 {{w|°F}}/37 {{w|°C}} as skin is cooler; Megan also believes that another object (Justin's shirt) was also measured within the infrared thermometer field of view, lowering the reported measurement. With such a measurement of ''hotness'', the hottest actor on any given day would probably be whoever is exercising, sick with a fever, or whoever has been outside in the sun the longest and/or has been sunburned, since this typically causes skin to be hot. Or, an animal actor, of a species with a higher body temperature than humans. ({{w|Category:Films about birds}})\n\nRandall here excludes the fact that accurately deriving surface temperature from bright (radiance) temperature requires knowing the emissivity of the object. Since not all objects radiate with the same efficiency, two objects with the same surface temperature will emit different thermal radiance, but if emissivity is not taken into account they will report different surface temperatures.\n\nThe title-text references the temperatures of Hollywood's rising stars, this time interpreting ''stars'' as actual stars, not famous people. In this case, the star {{w|Xi Persei|ξ Persei}} in the Perseus constellation (which is located in, and responsible for the fluorescence of, an object called the {{w|California Nebula}}), one of the hottest stars (35,000 {{w|kelvin}}s, {{w|Sun}}: 5,800 K) visible to the naked eye. In July, when this comic was published, the constellation Perseus and ξ Persei with it does indeed rise a few hours after sunset from Hollywood.  \n\nComic [[1111: Premiere]] is another comic based on \"star\" puns.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the Panel:]\n:Who are today's 10 hottest actors?\n:[Cueball is holding a clipboard, taking notes, while Megan aims an infrared thermometer off screen.]\n:Megan: 81.5, but I think it got part of his shirt.
