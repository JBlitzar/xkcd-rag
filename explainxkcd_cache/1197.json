These {{w|Patch (computing)|software increments}} might either be technical (to fix compatibility or security issues), or they might add new features that would go unnoticed. In addition, these updates are downloaded automatically by default, but the operating system might install them only if a user allows it to. The frequency of software changes (and changes in the way Adobe allows users to download new software) could result in confused users. In this case, the comic is saying that you must update the program ''before'' it can actually check for updates, something it already seems to be doing.\n\nThere is an actual message that a specific version of these updaters display:\n\n:[http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1348/738614725_09ad7d1d90.jpg ''The Adobe Updater must update itself before it can check for<br>updates. Would you like to update the Adobe Updater now?'']\n\nIn fact, the general necessity of such update managers has often been questioned, as they require the user to \"download software in order to download other software\". Other notable examples of companies who use update managers include {{w|Google}} and {{w|Sun microsystems|Sun}}/{{w|Oracle}}, with the latter being also mentioned in the title text.\n\nThe two buttons 'OK' and 'Download' are implied to have the same effect, indicating the user has no real choice, being both apparent \"Affirmative commit\" options. When choices are presented, there should ideally be one unambiguous \"positive action\" option (e.g. Yes/Ok/Install/Download/<Do the next expected response>) followed by one \"negative action\" one (e.g. No/Cancel/Do not install/Skip/<Don't give the next expected response>), to fit the dialogue (\"Do you wish to install? [Yes/No]\", \"Proceed to installation? [Ok/Cancel]\", or perhaps \"The installation process was paused, abort? [Yes, do not install/No, continue with installation]\"), with the possible separate use of \"Cancel\", or equivalent term, to add a \"no action\" to avoid either positive or negative commits (\"Do you want to save changes? [Yes, save ''(and quit)''/No, don't save ''(but quit anyway)''/Cancel ''(abort the attempt to quit)'']\").\n\nIn the comic's system message the \"Ok\" is an implicit command to continue with the suggested action, especially as it is the leftmost item, though not as unambiguously connected to the wording as it could be. The use of \"Ok\" is more suited for a message box with only the possibility to acknowledge and clear a necessary notification of something that has/will happen, with no other course of action available.\n\nThe \"Download\" is more explicitly linked to the suggested action, but does not seem to complement the other item properly. Additionally, it is differently rendered, either given focus (the default action, which is often positive-to-the-left or negative-to-the-right) or because it is actually disabled (leaving \"Ok\", for the presumed same purpose, the only viable choice to continue with). A further possible reason for its different appearance is that it is indicating that it is the process of being clicked, or obeying the hotkey/keyboard-shortcut assigned to it, but the comic shows Cueballs hands as nowhere near the keyboard, trackpad or possibly touchscreen of the laptop, as he stares in confusion, so this is unlikely without other conditions at play<!--, like it being a machine with remote access granted to another, or showing a remote session actually playing out on another machine ...but that's getting complicated, so let's not go all the way into that... -->.\n\nThe placement, and the perhaps more 'ready' state, of the 'OK' button implies that it is the default action. This then means that, ''if'' it unintuitively leads to the non-positive action, many users may just ignore the update. In cases where users are given a choice to skip updates (in favor of trying to do whatever they were doing when such a notification, and potentially indefinitely so) the tendency might be for users not to always keep up with the [[2224: Software Updates|very latest updating advice]]. Common statistics for the high rate of un-patched systems in the wild suggest that this happens a lot.\n\nThe title text also suggests that using update helper software which in turn must be updated bears the risk of creating a {{w|dependency hell}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a laptop with a window with a red title bar floating over his head.]\n:Adobe Update\n:There is an update for:\n:*'''Adobe Download Manager'''\n:This update will allow you to download the new updates to the Adobe Update Downloader.\n:[OK] [Download]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Software updates]]"
