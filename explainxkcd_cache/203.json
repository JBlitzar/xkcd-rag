However, the description is technically correct.\n\n[[Randall]] is using the comic to make a point about how we think dreaming is so normal, but if we actually realize what's happening, dreaming is very strange:\n*go comatose for a few hours = sleep for a few hours\n*hallucinate vividly = dream\n*suffer amnesia about the whole experience = forget the dream\nThe character on the left takes this as though the experience is normal. Which it indeed is, but that is why Randall has the caption above the guys: ''Sometimes it seems bizarre to me that we take dreaming in stride.''\n\nThe title text is about {{w|Lucid dream|lucid dreaming}}, where the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming. This is even more fascinating to Randall. He uses this type of dream in [[269: TCMP]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cueball-like guys are talking. Above them is the following caption:]\n:Sometimes it seems bizarre to me that we take dreaming in stride.\n\n:Friend: Are you coming to dinner?\n:Cueball: Yeah, but first I'm gonna go comatose for a few hours, hallucinate vividly, and then maybe suffer amnesia about the whole experience.\n:Friend: Okay, cool.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Dreams]]"
