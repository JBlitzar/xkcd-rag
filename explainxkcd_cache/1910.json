Flight plans do not need to be filed for many short flights at lower altitudes in good weather, so for a small aircraft like the PA-24, the missing flight plan alone should not be unusual. Many government or company planes used for secret purposes, like [https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/hidden-spy-planes FBI planes registered to fake companies], go a step further and are blacklisted from major databases. Regardless, it makes White Hat and Hairy wonder why, enough that they decide to post about it on their {{w|Aircraft spotting|plane spotter}} forums. (See [[1669: Planespotting]]). The reference to red trim on the Piper PA-24 Comanche could be a reference to the livery of {{w|Janet (airline)|Janet Airlines}} which operates clandestine flights between {{w|Las Vegas}}, {{w|Area 51}}, and {{w|Janet (airline)#Destinations|other desert military bases}}, although these planes are in fact registered to the {{w|Department of the Air Force}}, rather than a holding company.\n\nIn the second panel [[Hairbun]] and a male bird enthusiast are wondering why there is a {{w|broad-winged hawk}} in the area in November when many broad-winged hawks should have migrated south to areas like Florida and Central America. They decide to send a message to their {{w|birdwatching}} e-mail list. (See [[1824: Identification Chart]] and [[1826: Birdwatching]]). The two birdwatchers in this panel look like the old version of [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] in [[572: Together]].\n\nIn the last panel, a committee from what appears to be the {{w|National Security Agency}} wonders how to disguise their {{w|Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones}} so that people will not pay attention to them. The boss at the end of the table is lamenting the fact that both their bird- and plane-disguised drones have been noticed because of all these people constantly checking out the sky, also indicating that there are even more subcultures who are obsessed with things in the sky than the two mentioned already. [[Ponytail]] asks what else they could disguise their (secret) surveillance drones as, and Cueball suggests a {{w|weather balloon}}. But Ponytail shoots this down ([[559: No Pun Intended|no pun intended]]), since such a disguise would attract both the {{w|UFO}} enthusiasts and the \"weather people\" (presumably some regulation board that checks unauthorized use of meteorological survey balloons, or otherwise hobbyist meteorologists or perhaps even members of the [https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/ Cloud Appreciation Society]). She then jokes that she doesn't know which is worse. Since most people consider UFO enthusiasts to be into conspiracies, the \"weather people\" may be annoyed by this. Maybe [[Randall]] is indicating that people trying to predict the weather are correct as often as those claiming to have seen a UFO...\n\nThere are numerous instances of weather balloons being labeled as UFOs by enthusiasts, one of the most notable being the {{w|Roswell UFO incident}}, which for years was explained by the US military as a weather balloon crash, but turned out to be a nuclear test surveillance balloon. It is now known as the ''most thoroughly debunked UFO claim''. \n\nIn the title text, it is suggested that \"lost birthday party balloons\" should not attract too much attention. But then it is noted that it might make marine wildlife people angry, their concern probably being that balloons ultimately end up in some water body, which causes marine wildlife to get trapped in plastic and other synthetic material that was dumped in the water (see {{w|Marine debris}}). \"Marine wildlife people with sharks\" may be a reference to [[585: Outreach]], which also features a balloon carrying a shark. Another possible issue with disguising drones as \"lost balloons\" is that such balloons are quite rarely seen, and a sudden increase in the number of \"lost balloons\" seen would certainly raise suspicion even without a \"spotting community\" that focuses on them.\n\nAmong other types of people looking at the sky, the comic doesn't even get around to mentioning the subject of comic [[1644: Stargazing]]. It also fails to mention that something could be disguised as a regular cumulus cloud, which is usually ignored by the average person.{{cn}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat and Hairy are standing in front of some buildings. White Hat points to the sky while holding his smartphone in the other hand, while Hairy holds his smartphone up in both hands as he looks at the screen.]\n:White Hat: That's odd—another PA-24 Comanche with red trim. Registered to a holding company, no recent flight plans.\n:Hairy: I'll ask the forums if anyone knows who operates those.\n\n:[Hairbun and an old man with a white sailor cap are standing in a field with rolling hills behind them. Hairbun is looking at the sky through her binoculars, which she has on a string around her neck. The man also looks up but he is holding his string attached binoculars down in front of him.]\n:Hairbun: Goodness, I think that's a broad-winged hawk!\n:Man with sailor cap: In November?! They should be long gone by now!\n:Hairbun: I'll email the list.\n\n:[Five people sit around a table in a boardroom, which presumably belongs to the government as the table has a circular insignia with an eagle in the center and unreadable text in the ring around the eagle and beneath the insignia. A man with slick black hair is sitting at the end of the table in an office chair. The other four are sitting behind the long side of the table; from the left they are Cueball, Megan, another version of Hairy with spikier hair, and to the right, Ponytail.]\n:Man at the end of the table: Dammit, why are there so many different subcultures obsessed with staring at the sky?\n:Ponytail: What else could we disguise our surveillance drones as?\n:Cueball: Weather balloons?\n:Ponytail: No, that gets the UFO people ''and'' the weather people.\n:Ponytail: Don't know who's worse.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]\n[[Category:Drones]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]"
