However, because research is done in a laboratory using cultivated cancer cell assays in petri dishes or well plates, it typically does not take interactions with other parts of a body into consideration, which is ultimately necessary for a patient to survive treatment without harmful side-effects. In order for a cancer treatment to be viable, it would have to primarily target only cancer cells; not healthy ones. Added to this is the issue that major cancer in the body quickly evolves resistance to most treatments, most treatments end up either unused or used as just one in a cocktail of cancer fighting drugs.\n\nHere, [[Randall]] reminds us that there's no need to get excited upon hearing about a drug that kills cancer cells. In general, killing cancer cells is not too impressive for a drug, since something as mundane as a handgun is capable of destroying cancer cells too. On top of that, many substances that kill cancer cells can also harm healthy cells, just as a bullet fired from a handgun would.{{Citation needed}} Cancer treatments may involve generally harmful effects that are carefully applied to preferentially harm cancer cells as much as possible whilst doing the least amount of unavoidable damage to the rest of the body as is practical.\n\nThe title text suggests that even if a drug did only kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone, the human body still has many other complex processes that may render a drug that works in a petri dish insufficient. For instance, a drug that kills cancer cells in a petri dish may not be able to get at cancer cells deep within a human body, or it may have side effects that render it unusable. It is a long way from the laboratory to the pharmacy.\n\nA more humorous interpretation of the title text is that it will only kill cancer cells if they are in petri dishes, and not anywhere else. The naming convention here is similar to \"lung cancer\", breast cancer\", etc., but of course, petri dishes are not normally a part of human organism.{{Citation needed}} Less probably, it might be about cancer cells that originated from, but are not necessarily located within, petri dishes, making the scenario even more oddly specific.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:When you see a claim that a common drug or vitamin \"kills cancer cells in a petri dish,\" \n:Keep in mind:\n\n:[Cueball in a lab coat stands on a chair next to a desk, pointing a gun at a petri dish.
