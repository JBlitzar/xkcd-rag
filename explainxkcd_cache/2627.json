This comic explores what you could do with a hypothetical \"electron ___-scope\" and \"radio ___-scope\" for other \"regular\" items whose name also ends in -scope (namely: {{w|periscope}}, {{w|stethoscope}}, {{w|kaleidoscope}}, {{w|gyroscope}} and {{w|horoscope}}). The third column with \"radio\" often plays on different meanings of the word ''radio:'' 1) related to radiation and 2) a device for receiving radio communication or broadcasts. The title text makes a pun on \"gyroscope\" and a middle-eastern pita wrap called a \"{{w|gyros}}\", incorrectly taken to be plural by many non-Greek speakers.\n===What the words could mean according to the comic===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Word !! Regular ___ !! Electron ___ !! Radio ___\n|-\n! {{w|Microscope}}\n| A laboratory instrument used for magnifying small objects.\n| ''{{w|Electron Microscope|Really exists:}}'' A microscope that uses a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination has a higher resolution than a conventional microscope.\n| Simply a microscope that one would use when repairing a radio.\n|-\n! {{w|Telescope}}\n| An optical instrument used for observing distant objects.\n| ''{{w|Calorimetric Electron Telescope|''Really exists''}}'': A type of telescope used to detect electrons and other high-energy particles, such as cosmic rays.\n| ''{{w|Radio Telescope|Really exists:}}'' A directional antenna is used to detect radio waves from astronomical radio sources in the sky.\n|-\n! {{w|Periscope }}\n|  Periscopes allow submarine crews to watch what happens above the water surface, without exposing the submarine to enemy observers, or enemy radars. In practice, periscope use is minimized because periscopes are still observable, but to a lesser degree.\n| An electron microscope seemingly mounted on a periscope. Examining enemy boats like a periscope, with the detail of an electron microscope. This would not be useful in combat.{{Citation needed}}\n| In principle, the German navy invented radio periscopes during World War II. The {{w|Metox radar detector}}'s early antenna had to be built up after surfacing and dismantled before diving. Later, the fixed ''Bali'' antenna could act as a true periscope, in order to detect aircraft and ships that were using radar to hunt submarines.\n\nRadio signals do not propagate well in water, so raising a radio receiver above the water would be necessary for listening to {{w|NPR}} (National Public Radio, a popular public radio network in the United States) or any radio station which is not in the {{w|extremely low frequency}} band.\n|-\n! {{w|Stethoscope}}\n\n|  A medical device for listening to sounds made by a patient's body, for example, the heart. It has a disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the patient's skin.\n\n|  If the resonator is emitting electromagnetic radiation, it could burn the skin due to its close proximity.\n\n|  Normally, the sounds are transmitted to an earpiece that the examiner wears. There are also recording stethoscopes. A radio stethoscope would transmit the sound either directly via radio waves, or send it to a radio station such as NPR where it could then be broadcasted. \n|-\n! {{w|Kaleidoscope}}\n| A optical instrument that uses two or more tilted reflectors to show a regular symmetrical pattern\n| Seemingly a pun of electron \"collide\"-scope, as electron collisions generate {{w|Bremsstrahlung}}.\n| The scan button on a radio scans through many frequencies, and the radio station changes a lot, depending on the frequency. The rapid change is reminiscent of a normal kaleidoscope.\n|-\n! {{w|Gyroscope}}\n| Gyroscopes are used for {{w|inertial navigation}}, for example.\n| Gyroscopes make stuff point in certain directions by spinning. An {{w|Electromagnet}} uses sometimes-spinning electric fields to induce a magnetic field, moving magnetic stuff and, in some instances, making it point in a certain direction.\n| A {{w|phonograph}}, also called a record player or a turntable, spins a {{w|Phonograph record|vinyl record}} to stimulate an electromagnetic needle, which plays music. Such devices are common in radio stations.\n\nIn theory, radio waves could be sent around in a triangular pattern, thus replicating the existing {{w|ring laser gyroscope}}.\n|-\n! {{w|Horoscope}}\n\n|  In common usage, predictions or advice is given based on the position of stars and planets. Largely unscientific, it is much closer to a {{w|Rorschach Test}} than person-specific information. \n\n|  Predicting the position of a particle, such as an electron (possibly based on the position of stars and planets). In a funny twist, the exact location of an electron cannot be determined, due to {{w|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle}}.\n\n|  This seems to be little different from a regular horoscope, but recording the movement and position of the stars and galaxies with a radio telescope instead of a regular telescope.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Content is a table, with column headings \"Regular ''Blank'' Scope\", \"Electron ''Blank'' Scope\", and \"Radio ''Blank'' Scope\".
