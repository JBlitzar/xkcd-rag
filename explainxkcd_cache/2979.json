The alarm is triggered when a relatively interesting astronomical event occurs, for example, the {{w|Perseid meteor shower}} and blue {{w|supermoon}} that happened recently. Randall remarks in the caption how he wants this device and wishes it existed. Cueball and Megan (and by extension [[Randall]]) feel that they regularly miss events they'd like to see, and such a device would help prevent this.\n\nThe title text further specifies that he would want it to activate even for more common sky-related spectacles, such as interesting clouds and nice sunsets (which still can be very beautiful). In short, it would help its owner to not miss interesting outdoor sights.\n\nMost recently before this comic, Randall referred to cool sky phenomena in [[2971: Celestial Event]]. Quite a few such references preceded this (such as the aforementioned {{w|Perseid meteor shower}}), so they may have been on Randall's mind.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A rectangular device with a light on top and a label on its side, is seen resting on a stool to the left. It is activated and the light on top of it is glowing and a voice is emanating from it, maybe even speaking the siren part of the sound that comes between sentences. Cueball, sitting on an office chair at his desk, looks away from his laptop so he is now facing the device while Megan is on the other side of the desk running away from it towards the right edge of the panel.]\n:Label: Sky Alarm\n:Sky alarm: ''Weeee Ooooo Weeee Ooooo''\n:Sky alarm: ''There's a cool space thing happening!''\n:Sky alarm: ''Weeee Ooooo Weeee Ooooo''\n:Sky alarm: ''Go outside and look up!''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I want this device.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Weather]]"
