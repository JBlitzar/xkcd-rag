He loves to play with everything, and nothing is more exciting than {{w|Staple gun|a tool}} that sticks things together with an impressive ''kaCHUNK'' sound when he pulls the trigger, even on things that (definitely) shouldn't be stapled.\n\nInstalling {{w|Debian}} is a pun on the installation of software, and the installation of real life things by attaching them to things.  \n\nThis comic may reference an engineering truism describing a similar scenario: \"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" The truism's actual meaning refers to the scenario where when a novice has only learned to use one tool (such as one programming language), they may attempt to solve all problems using only that tool, which may end badly. This saying is referred to explicitly in [[801: Golden Hammer]].\n\nFrom just reading the comic by itself, one may presume that in the last panel, [[Cueball]] has been stapled to the ceiling (as obvious evidence to [[Megan]] that Beret Guy has indeed been abusing her staple gun). According to the comic's [http://xkcd.com/478/info.0.json official transcript], however, it is in fact God who is speaking. Due to Beret Guy's [[:Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy|strange powers]], it is rather likely that God has been stapled as well -- perhaps to the ceiling.\n\n{{w|Duct tape}}, thanks to its combination of tensile and adhesive strength, is commonly regarded as the ultimate do-it-yourself repair tool. Like a staple gun, it can also be used to stick things together. Although it does make a nice sound when pulling a strip out quickly, it does not make a loud ''kaCHUNK'' sound upon fixing two objects together.\n\nIn [[291: Dignified]], Beret Guy hangs upside down and says (in the title text) that he has stapled his hat to his head to make it stay on. That may very well have been the inspiration for this comic.\n\nThis was the fourth time the [[Megan#Name|name Megan]] was used in xkcd, the first time being in [[159: Boombox]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy and Cueball standing.]\n:Beret Guy: [holding up a staple gun] I found Megan's staple gun!\n:Cueball: [facepalming] Oh no.\n\n:[Beret Guy kneeling over a laptop on the floor.]\n:Cueball: [from outside panel] Oh God, what are you--\n:Beret Guy: [stapling a DVD to the laptop] Installing Debian!
