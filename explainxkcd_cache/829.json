The first three panels depict a group of scientists—including one shown with long, curly hair bound in a ponytail, identifiable from this hairstyle as {{w|Felisa Wolfe-Simon}}, the post-doctoral research associate who spearheaded the arsenic research (see [[2421: Tower of Babel]] for another female scientist who is identifiable by her hairstyle)—preparing for their press conferences announcing the details of the discovery.\n\nThe trio are worried that the press conference about their discovery will be less exciting to the reporters, because the press are expecting news of life on {{w|Saturn}}'s largest moon, {{w|Titan (moon)|Titan}}. The researchers decide to try and make the event more exciting, but they don't know how to throw a good party. As a result, they look up advice on the internet and decide to serve cocktails and {{w|Hors d'oeuvre|hors d'œuvres}} to fit the theme of the event.\n\nThe final panel shows the result, where the reporters are either dead or dying. It is implied that in order to fit the theme the researchers have laced the food and drinks with arsenic. \n\n{{w|Arsenic}} is a chemical element which is known to be poisonous to humans and most other life forms. In 2010 {{w|NASA}} announced the discovery of bacteria {{w|GFAJ-1}} (an abbreviation for \"give Felisa a job\") and claimed it to be able to sustain itself when starved of phosphorus, by substituting arsenic for a small percentage of its phosphorus. Most scientists did not believe this and it was disproven in 2012.<ref>Tobias J.

It is a common theme in xkcd to show scientists who may be extremely clever within their field, but sometimes lack common sense and are inept at social situations. Reporters are often criticized for over sensationalizing discoveries and hunting for exciting stories.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three people, a curly, dark-haired girl with a ponytail (identifiable from context and hairstyle as Felisa Wolfe-Simon), Megan, and Cueball, stand looking at a laptop screen, which is sitting on a desk. Dr. Wolfe-Simon is pointing at the screen. There is no speech line down to her, but from her posture it must be assumed she does the talking written above the three.]\n:Wolfe-Simon: Our arsenic-based DNA discovery is cool, but these reporters are expecting life on Titan! Our press conference will be such a letdown!\n\n:[Wolfe-Simon turns around to face Megan, zooming in so Cueball is not in the frame.]\n:Wolfe-Simon: Okay, we need to make it more exciting for them. How do you make an event entertaining?\n:Megan: Dunno, I suck at parties. Music, I guess?\n\n:[Wolfe-Simon turns back around and leans over to start typing on the computer, while the other two look on. Megan puts her hand to her chin.]\n:Wolfe-Simon: WikiHow says you can \"serve cocktails and hors d'œrves that fit the theme of your event.\"\n:Megan: Easy enough!\n\n:[Wolfe-Simon stands on a podium behind a lectern ready to deliver the news, while Cueball stands amongst the audience, holding a tray with three drinks glasses. A fourth glass lies at foot of the lectern on the podium. Two Cueball-like guys in the audience are lying on the floor, one of them having fallen backwards in his chair, while a third Cueball-like guy is still standing but has his hands up to his throat as he is suffocating. Finally, Ponytail is slumped over in her seat with her head on her chest. One empty chair is still standing.]\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The words \"hors d'oerves\" at the comic are just a misspelling by Randall for \"hors d'oeuvres\" (in French ''\"hors d'œuvre\"'' both singular and plural). The English pronunciation of these words is awr-DURVZ /ɔrˈdɜrvz/, with the R '''before''' the V, not after, which explains the mistake.<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hors+d%27oeuvre</ref> As opposed to the original French pronunciation, where the v and r keep the same order.<ref>http://fr.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C5%93uvre</ref>\n*The advice \"Serve cocktails, hors d'œuvres, and snacks that fit the theme of your event\" is an actual step on wikiHow article \"How to Make an Event Entertaining\".<ref>https://www.wikihow.com/Make-an-Event-Entertaining</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]"
