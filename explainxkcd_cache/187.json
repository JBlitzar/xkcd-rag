Cueball refuses by giving a list of excuses, including the statement that \"rationalizing the familiar is easy.\" This statement is amusing, because Cueball acknowledges the fact that he is making excuses and seems to refuse going out on the basis that rationalizing going to see the sunrise would require much more effort. This criticizes some people's tendency of not trying new things or going out with friends, even though one would likely get more fulfillment by doing these things. It may well be implied that the friend doing the inviting has left to view the sunrise, leaving Cueball behind since he wasn't willing to engage in an activity.\n\nThe computer with the egg-shaped profile looks like an iMac G3, sold from 1998 until 2003. It seems that rationalizing the familiar has made Cueball resistant to upgrading his computer long beyond its obsolescence date.\n\nThe title text indicates [[Randall|Randall's]] frustration with this mentality. It's common to state vague intentions like \"we should hang out sometime\" or \"let's do something together sometime\", but these promises are rarely followed up on. Randall wishes the people he talks to would take the initiative by suggesting they do something together ''now'' instead of putting it off.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A guy is standing behind his friend who sits at a computer. Both look like Cueball.]\n:Guy: Let's go see sunrise over the ocean.\n:[The friend turns and replies:]\n:Friend: That's a long drive, it's cold, I'm tired, and rationalizing the familiar is easy.\n:[The guy leaves, and in the next two frames, the friend remains at his computer alone.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
