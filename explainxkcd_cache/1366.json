But at speeds much lower than the speed of light it also applies to {{w|Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics}}.\n\nRather than viewing this situation as a train causing itself to move relative to an immobile Earth, [[Randall]] provides the unconventional perspective of a train remaining fixed in space while causing the Earth itself and all the stars in the sky to rotate instead. In principle either perspective is equally valid â€” though in practice different trains often move in mutually-exclusive directions, thus each train would have to define its own frame of reference. It is said that Einstein once asked a ticket collector, \"What time does Oxford stop at this train?\"\n\nFrom the Newtonian perspective this choice of frame is valid, but results in unnecessarily complicated math; the equation of motion would include terms for centrifugal, Coriolis and other so-called {{w|Inertial force|\"fictitious forces\"}} (see [[123: Centrifugal Force]]). {{w|Isaac Newton|Newton}} supposes the existence of \"inertial frames\", in which these forces are zero, and the surface of the Earth approximates an inertial frame well. In General Relativity, the presence of mass in a system curves the {{w|spacetime}} around of it. The train-earth system could be modeled in general relativity, taking the train as fixed. However the resulting equations would be complex, and not amenable to an exact solution.\n\nThe title text expands on this to include elevators, which change a person's position relative to the center of the Earth. From a passenger's perspective, it would appear as though the Earth's position was instead being changed in space.\n\nThese examples use the train and the elevator as fixed points to define relative travel. The more common method to define movement is to use the Earth's surface as fixed point, but other reference points could be the {{w|Earth's rotation|Earth's center}}, the {{w|Earth's orbit|Sun}}, predefined {{w|Fixed star|\"fixed\" stars}} or the {{w|Galactic year|center of our galaxy}}. Each of these would result in a completely different movement speed:\n*The speed of the train (stationary on the equator) relative to the earth's center: 465&nbsp;m/s (1,674&nbsp;km/h or 1,040&nbsp;mph)\n*The speed of the train (on earth) relative to the sun: 30&nbsp;km/s (108,000&nbsp;km/h or 67,000&nbsp;mph)\n*The speed of the train (on earth) relative the center of our galaxy: 220&nbsp;km/s (828,000&nbsp;km/h or 514,000&nbsp;mph)\n\nThe train, as seen from an inertial frame, doesn't seem to rotate the earth, but it does in fact have a minute, immeasurable effect on the Earth's rotation (see [http://what-if.xkcd.com/41/ what-if? 41: Go West] and [[162: Angular Momentum]]).\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''Train:'''\n:[On the upper edge of a circle representing the Earth, Cueball is in a train car looking to his left.]\n:Cueball:...almost...\n:[The train tracks run between another person standing at the 2:00 position, and Hairy standing at the 9:30 position.
