He explains how for fifteen minutes, he watched the kid's balloon, hoping the balloon would get caught in the ceiling fan and, as its cord became wound up, drag the kid up towards it. This looks like it could cause serious injury to the child and/or damage to the venue. The title text concludes that the narrator is now considering himself {{tvtropes|WouldHurtAChild|a bad person}} for hoping for this to happen. This might be a poke to people who think that waiting for a disaster to happen makes you a bad person like in [[611: Disaster Voyeurism]].\n\nIt is unlikely that the strength of the balloon rope and of the ceiling fan would be enough to lift the child.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three drawings in one panel. A Cueball-like kid is holding a red balloon; The balloon gets caught in ceiling fan; The kid still holds on and is thus pulled up. Above the drawings is the following caption:]\n:I watched the scene in the restaurant for a full fifteen minutes, hoping this would happen:\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
