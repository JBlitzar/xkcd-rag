The authors of the book follows this line, presenting an (arguably) more sexist porn, that instead has no sex but several images of extremely attractive men performing household chores. Megan objects to this, stating that her porn contains sex.\n\n''Galactica'' is the ship from the show {{w|Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)|''Battlestar Galactica''}}. Megan likely has a romantic attraction to some of the characters on the show, possibly involving {{w|Shipping (fandom)|\"shipping\" fanfiction}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan sits at a desk, typing on a computer with a fairly large flat-panel display.]\n:Megan: To the authors of ''Porn for Women'':\n:Your book features pictures of hot, clothed guys cooking, doing laundry and vacuuming.\n\n:[Megan continues typing.]\n:Megan: The idea seems to be that my deepest fantasies, like the rest of my life, likely revolve around housework.\n\n:[Megan continues typing.]\n:Megan: So I wanted to write in to clarify: in my porn,\n\n:[Megan leans forward in her chair.]\n:Megan: People ''fuck''.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
