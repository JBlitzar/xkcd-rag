In the comic, Earth has established communications with aliens living on {{w|Proxima Centauri b}}, the nearest exoplanet to Earth according to current knowledge, and [[Randall]] has taught them about a high-five.\n\nInstead of physically slapping hands, the high-five is executed by transmitting messages, as in a {{w|Handshake (computing)}}. The diagram in the comic is thus similar to a {{w|sequence diagram}}, one usually employed for describing network communication in computing. As the messages travel at the speed of light and Proxima Centauri b is over 4 light years away, the times in the diagram are measured in (Earth-)years. This is a very slow method of communication â€“ a perfect setup for a \"too slow\" prank. We can also see that they are taking around <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of a year (approximately an Earth-week) to cue up their considered response, yet clearly Cueball seems quite ready to respond in about half that time (though any quicker would get lost, and appear simultaneous, at the given precision of decimal places).\n\nHaving found this way of exchanging a high-five with aliens, Randall successfully pranks the aliens by sending the \"too slow\" message before their \"Low-5\" message ''can'' even arrive on Earth, and over an Earth-month before it actually does. This is similar to how, in the original prank, the prankster anticipates the provoked reaction and pulls their hand away after the victim started to move but before the \"Low-Five\" can taken place.\n\nThe aliens do not take kindly to being pranked and start an interstellar war, presumably intending to invade Earth. It is not known at which speed the Centaurians' invasion fleet travels and, therefore, when it will reach Earth. The [[wikipedia:Spatial scale|scale]] of the fleet is also unknown, and with good fortune, it may again prove to be [https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/G%27Gugvuntts microscopic].\n\nThe title text refers to another prank, in which the prankster gets the victim to ask \"What's updog?\" This is usually done by saying a sentence or asking a question that contains the noun 'updog'. Should the victim of the prank be confused, they will likely ask for clarification as to what 'updog' is (i.e, \"What's updog?\") At this point, the prankster will then respond as though the victim had asked them 'What's up, dawg?', resulting in probable groans and embarrassment. More on the joke's history and prevalence can be found [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/updog here]. \n\nTau Ceti is a star almost 12 light years away. The exchange might have gone like this:\n* t=0y: ''Randall:'' Hey, do you think it smells like updog in here?\n* t=12y: ''Aliens:'' What's updog?\n* t=24y: ''Randall:'' Nothin', what's up with you?\n* t=36y: ''Message received, Aliens start war''\n\"Updog\" was previously introduced in [[1696: AI Research]].\nThis is an example of a type of joke called a {{tvtropes|WhatsAHenway|henway}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A diagram of messages transmitted between the Earth and Proxima Centauri b is shown. An image of the Earth is on the left and Proxima Centauri b on the right at the top, and below each is a vertical timeline.
