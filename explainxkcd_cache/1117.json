Last panel is a pun on {{w|cloud computing}} and specifically {{w|cloud storage}}, and looks like a follow up to [[1032: Networking]]. The obvious joke is that, instead of “cloud” (Internet-based) storage, [[Beret Guy]]'s business is literally storage ''of'' clouds.\n\nThe title text is a further statement, that his first words came while looking up at the sky. This relates to the first panel, where Beret Guy is shown hanging to the grass ceiling of an upside-down panel; the joke is that from an outside perspective not only would Beret Guy appear upside-down, but so would his written-out speech. As a child, Beret Guy would be looking up at his mom, and with a similar flipping of his speech his first word \"MOM\" would appear as \"WOW\".\n\nThere are some connections with both [[908: The Cloud]] and the title text of [[1444: Cloud]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The panel is upside-down. Beret Guy is holding onto the \"ceiling\", there is an upside-down cloud at the bottom of the panel.]\n:Beret guy [to the solitary cumulus cloud.]: Oh—Hello down there! Welcome to My Sky!\n\n:[The panel is now oriented in the conventional sense with the ground at the bottom. Beret Guy is standing on his feet too, and the sky now shows a second cloud.]\n:Beret guy: It's pretty good. I like it. It's not the same color as ''anything''.\n\n:[The sky is now blanketed by alto-cirrus clouds.]\n:Beret guy: \"Wow! There are a ''lot'' of you! Good thing it's so big.\n\n:[The scene now depicts a party, where Beret Guy is talking to Ponytail.]\n:Ponytail: \"And what do ''you'' do?\"\n:Beret Guy: \"I'm in the cloud storage business.\"\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was referenced in [[2765: Escape Speed]]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Beret Guy's Business]]"
