If these labels were to become astrophysical objects in reality, made of any kind of matter we're aware of, it would quickly result in major changes to the universe. As each of these labels would need to be clearly visible from an observatory, they would require monstrous size — maybe even big enough to collapse into black holes when applied to particularly distant stars. They would also create a sudden lack of need for themselves, as the stars would be gravitationally attracted to their respective labels and promptly destroyed.\n\nThe label in this image appears to be pointing to a star in the spiral galaxy M106 (also known as \"{{w|Messier 106}}\" and \"NGC 4258\"), located between 22 and 25 million light-years (MLY) away from Earth and compatible with the 23.6163 MLY shown in the comic.\n\nThe title text extends the main joke by suggesting that the \"crosshairs\" around red giant stars, put into an image by an astronomer to indicate those stars starting to burn helium, are actual objects in space which are of a standardized size when seen from Earth. One such set of crosshairs can be seen in the comic. Stars at this stage of stellar evolution are of particular astronomical interest because they all have the {{w|Standard candles|same absolute brightness}}, allowing their distance to be determined because the observed luminosity is a simple inverse-distance-squared falloff from a known original value. This is referred to as the \"{{w|tip of the red-giant branch}}\" (TRGB) distance calculation method, referring to the red-giant region of the {{w|Hertzsprung–Russell diagram}}. This allows estimation of distances not only to the stars themselves, but also to distant galaxies that contain them. In the weeks before this comic appeared, [https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-webb-hubble-telescopes-affirm-universes-expansion-rate-puzzle-persists/ findings based on measurements of star and galaxy distances] reinforced a longstanding quandary in cosmology known as the {{w|Hubble tension}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is standing behind a lectern, pointing towards a large screen behind her with a stick. On the screen is a scattering of small, hard-to-make-out galaxies and stars with illegible writing next to them. On the screen behind Ponytail, one of these stars has been circled, and there are graphics indicating it is being repeatedly magnified along with the text next to it. At the first level of magnification the text next to this star remains somewhat illegible, but at the second level it is readable, albeit partially cut off and blurry.]\n\n:[First level of magnification (... represents cut off text)]:\n:M106 0-06832\n:Distance:\n:23.6163 MLY (27...\n\n:[Second level of magnification (... represents cut off text)]:\n:M106 0-06...\n:Distance:\n:23.6163 MLY...\n\n:[Caption below the panel]:\n:Cosmology News: New telescopes are finally powerful enough to read the little labels next to stars showing how far away they are.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Telescopes]]"
