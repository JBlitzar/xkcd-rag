Before its release in May 1999, ''The Phantom Menace'' was one of the most anticipated movies of all time, with fans camped in lines outside of movie theaters as much as a full month in advance of ticket sales. In this comic, Cueball and his friend are apparently still waiting to see the movie, not having realized that they are waiting outside of a building that is not a movie theater. More importantly, they have been waiting for twelve years, which should be long enough to realize their error.\n\nDarth Maul, the source of Cueball's friend's costume, is a Sith apprentice in the film. [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith The Sith] are the group of characters in the ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' universe who embrace [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force the dark side] of [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Force the Force] and are the antagonists throughout the series. Cueball is holding a cheap replica of a {{w|lightsaber}}, which is the weapon used by the [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi Jedi] and the Sith. \n\nThis comic seems to be poking fun at those people who are willing to wait long in advance for the release of some product or the first theatrical release of a movie. The title text expands upon this when one of the characters states that going to a theater across town may be better, but he is worried about taking the chance due to the possibility of losing their place in this line, a misplaced sense of priorities if the line goes nowhere, and they are presently the only two in it. This comic may have been commemorating the 3D version of ''The Phantom Menace'', which was released two months after this comic's publication.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, holding a lightsaber, and another stick figure character in a Darth Maul mask stand on the sidewalk outside of a brick building in an urban area. Each is holding money in his or her hand<!-- see original transcript by Randall -->. There is a broken window on the building.]\n\n:[Beat panel. They continue to stand there.]\n\n:[Beat panel.
