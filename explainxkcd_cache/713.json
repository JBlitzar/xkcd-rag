Man, screw you, GeoIP.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Geolocation|GeoIP}} is a service that converts IP addresses to their respective location on the Earth. This is done by looking up the IP address in a database maintained by various internet service providers. Advertisers often take advantage of the {{w|Keeping up with the Joneses|Jones effect}} by creating localized ads which misleadingly appear to be specific to your location, but are often generic advertisements featuring stock photographs with the name of a nearby settlement inserted into the text.\n\nThe comic satirizes this phenomenon. The {{w|International Space Station}} (ISS) has a high speed data downlink, but no direct connection to the internet. But here, [[Cueball]] trolls the advertisers from on board the ISS, by inserting his actual location on {{w|low Earth orbit}} into the database under that IP address. He proudly presents his result to [[Ponytail]] where the advertisements claim that there are \"local girls\" (one of whom vaguely resembles [[Danish]]) in low Earth orbit; a distance of roughly 420 kilometers above the Earth surface, and thus at least that far away from all other girls in the world if they are not on the space station (or a nearby spacecraft, such as one bringing supplies to the space station). The fact that the phrase \"Low Earth Orbit\" is slightly grayed out serves to illustrate that that location has been inserted into the generic advertisement.\n\nThe title text shows GeoIP has become so accurate that it can now pinpoint the user's location to his Mom's basement. In United States, an adult living with his parents is considered shameful for that person, since it means that the adult does not have a job and cannot support themself. The ads are typically of the form -- \"Meet hot young singles in <user's location>\" where the <user's location> part is filled in from GeoIP. In this case, the GeoIP is so accurate that it not just identifies that user is in his parents' house, but it also pinpoints the location that he's hiding in the basement, perhaps because he does not want to be seen by people visiting his parents. Thus GeoIP is unknowingly shaming the user by reminding him that he is in his mom's basement, and hence the \"Screw you\" response. However, this would also prove the false nature of these advertisements, as the user is unlikely to have not noticed any hot young singles currently sharing his mom's basement.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[External view of the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the blue Earth below, shown with white clouds as stripes below and black sky above.

The ad has a heading and then shows two photos of long haired girls in sexy poses each with captions below and a labeled button at the bottom. The location (as messed up by Cueball) is written in gray, the rest of the text is in black, to indicate that this part of the text has been inserted in the ad based on the location.]\n:Meet local girls in\n:<font color=\"gray\">Low Earth Orbit</font>\n:tonight!\n:Tanya, 18 \n:Amber, 19\n:Chat live\n\n{{Comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]"
