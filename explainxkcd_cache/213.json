The box, a \"Muon Containment Trap,\" is a device used in the film to capture ghosts. It is connected to a footswitch by a cable. The man trying to leave is about to be pulled into the box and held there indefinitely (against his will, of course).\n\nThe title text refers to Julius Caesar's crossing of the {{w|Rubicon#History|Rubicon}}, a river (or very large stream) that marked the border between Roman Italy and an area of land Caesar was the appointed governor of. At the end of his term, the Roman Senate ordered him to disband his army and return to Italy. Instead, he brought his forces past the border, an act of treason and rebellion against the Republic, instigating the Roman Civil War. The phrase \"crossing the Rubicon\" now means making a move with gigantic consequences that cannot be undone. In the film ''Ghostbusters'', the protagonists use \"proton packs\" that fire \"streams\" of energy. The inventor of the device warns that these streams should not be crossed against each other, as doing so \"would be bad.\" Just how bad? \"Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.\" Important safety tip.{{cn}}\n\n:Final quote taken from the 1984 movie ''{{w|Ghostbusters}}''.<!-- can someone better explain this sentence fragment, with indent..?
