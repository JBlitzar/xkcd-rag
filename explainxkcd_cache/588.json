These events typically take place during {{w|High school football|football}} or basketball season. The student body is crowded into the gymnasium, often the school fight song is played, {{w|Cheerleading|cheerleaders}} and/or the school mascot might do a routine, and the team is introduced. The intent of such events is to inspire {{w|school spirit}} and encourage support for the sports team and attendance at games. \n\nRandall apparently finds such events to be \"creepy\". The notion of \"school spirit\" tends to involve emotional involvement with a group identity which is almost entirely arbitrary. As Randall points out, American school districts are generally divided geographically (by ZIP code, in this case), and which school a person attends is both involuntary and more or less random. Moreover, the notion of such rallies is based around hyping up the school, with cheers calling themselves \"the best\" or something similar being quite common. Not infrequently, there's either an implicit or explicit denigration of whatever school is their primary rival in sports. \n\nThat notion clearly troubles Randall, because such divisions make no sense, and are potentially hurtful and even harmful. \n\nIn this strip, while some students appear to agree with the sentiment, others openly challenge it, pointing out that students from the opposing school have done kind things for them. This sentiment appears to spread, as multiple people chime in, referring to good people who happen to go to, or work at, a different school. One student mentions that he's texting with a friend who goes to the other school, who \"sounded kind of hurt\" by their cheer. \n\nIn a superficial sense, this can be taken as a deconstruction of things like cheers and slogans (which were likely never meant to be taken literally). In a larger sense, though, defining oneself by an arbitrary group identity (be that national, ethnic, religious, political, etc) and treating that in-group as better than others, is common human tendency that can have very serious social consequences. The strip seems to encourage seeing others as human beings and being kind to everyone as more important than having strong group identities. \n\nThe title text says that Randall was weirded out by pep rallies growing up. Introverted people, particularly those with little love of sports, are often uncomfortable with such rallies. Now that he's older, he finds them even ''more'' creepy, possibly because he sees them as promoting a brand of tribalism and {{w|groupthink}} which he finds troubling.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail stands in front of crowded bleachers (with only Cueballs in it), waving pompoms high in the air.]\n:Ponytail: Lakeview High is the best!\n:Crowd: Yeah!\n:Voice #1: Wait, why?\n\n:[Zoom on Ponytail, now with her hands and pompoms down.]\n:Ponytail: What?\n:Voice #1 (off-screen): A guy on the North High football team helped me rebuild my deck. \n:Voice #1 (off-screen): It seems ungrateful to presume we're better.\n\n:[Same picture with Ponytail now just listening.]\n:Voice #1 (off-screen): I mean, school districts are just based on zip codes.\n:Voice #2 (off-screen): Their principal donated a kidney to my dad.\n\n:[Ponytail looks down, holding up her pompoms.]\n:Voice #1 (off-screen): I'm texting with my friend there now.
