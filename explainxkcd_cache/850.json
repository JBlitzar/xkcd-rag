And they taught us that Uzbekistan is one of the world's two doubly-landlocked countries!\n}}\n*A [http://xkcd.com/850_large/ larger version] of this image can be found by clicking the image at xkcd.com - the comic's page can also be accessed by clicking on the comic number above.\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThere's a somewhat well-circulated image on the internet entitled \"The World According to Americans\" which plays on the stereotype of the ignorant American. In it, the entirety of Eastern Europe and most of Asia are entitled \"commies\" and the Middle-East as \"evil-doers,\" and so on. Later, other people created similar maps to re-do the concept. It later spread to other cultures. \n\nThis comic is an anti-joke playing on that idea. You expect to see something which plays on the {{w|stereotypes}} that exist in American culture of various parts of the world. However, instead, the map is remarkably well-informed, and shows how sampling bias can be used to conflate results. See below the [[#Table of items in the map|table of items in the map]].\n\nThe title text jokes that it was \"not their fault\" that the Americans involved were coming from a {{w|National Geographic Bee|geography bee}}. On the other hand, if even apparent geography buffs use vague labels such as \"rest of South America\" and \"various former Soviet states\" instead of using more detailed labels, the average American are likely even less geographically knowledgeable. (Although, as the illustrators wrote below Cape Horn, the reason they did not draw Antarctica or many South American, Middle Eastern and British countries and the lack of detail may be because the people who asked them to draw this map were beginning to 'look impatient' since they did not get the expected ignorant result.)\n\nA {{w|landlocked country}} is a country that does not border any major bodies of water. Furthering the concept, a {{w|Landlocked country#Doubly landlocked|doubly-landlocked}} country is a country that not only has no connection to water, but is only bordered by ''other'' landlocked countries. As the title text states, there are only two such countries in the world as of the date of the comic: {{w|Uzbekistan}} and {{w|Liechtenstein}}. {{w|South Sudan}} became officially recognised as a new independent state not long after this comic's publication but, being only a ''singly-''landlocked nation, did not alter this particular statistic. This is the type of fact that may be stereotypically expected to be known by a sufficiently well-prepared {{w|National Geographic Bee|geography bee}} competitor.\n\n===Table of items in the map===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"width: 25%;\"|Annotation\n! Further details\n|-\n| Hey so what projection should we use? I’ll aim for \"Robinson\".\n| Any flat [[977|map projection]] of a sphere must have inaccuracies. {{w|Mercator projection}} displays shapes well at the expense of size. For example, Mercator's Greenland appears larger than South America, but is actually one eighth the size. {{w|Gall-Peters projection}} does the opposite, showing accurate surface area with distorted (\"awful\") shapes. {{w|Robinson projection}} compromises between shape & size for aesthetics; hence Greenland is \"still too big\".\n|- \n| Did you know Maine is actually the US state closest to Africa?\n| The distance is about 5076&nbsp;km (~3754&nbsp;mi). Measurement points are {{w|Sail Rock (disambiguation)|Sail Rock (Maine)}}, the most eastern point of the USA, and a point which seems to be the most southern (and as such western) point of el-Beddouza Beach, {{w|Morocco}}. It's not the most western point of Morocco (or Africa), though.\n|-\n| Hispañola\n| For some reason, the map labels the island of {{w|Hispaniola}} using an archaic and now rarely-used spelling of its name.\n|-\n| Do we have to label all the Virgin Islands?\n| Which are {{w|Virgin Islands#Larger Islands|9 larger}} and about 100 {{w|List of Caribbean islands#British Virgin Islands|smaller}} {{w|List of Caribbean islands#United States Virgin Islands|islands}} — surely a lot of labels. The location of the label suggests this actually refers to the larger chain of islands which makes up the {{w|Lesser Antilles}}.\n|-\n| French, and I think Dutch and English\n| The three separated areas are (from west to east) {{w|Guyana}} (former British colony), {{w|Suriname}} (former Dutch colony) and {{w|French Guiana}} (still officially part of France). The former two often switched between French, Dutch and British colonial rule. The latter was French most times except for a short Portuguese episode.\n|-\n| Brazil (Portugese-speaking)\nRest of South America (Spanish-speaking)\n| In green is Portuguese-speaking Brazil, and in blue are the Spanish speaking Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina.\n|-\n| {{w|Greenland}} (Still too big!)\nYeah, but the Peters map is awful\n| Relating back to the choice of map projection, the apparent size of Greenland is one of the most commonly known projection based inaccuracies. The {{w|Gall-Peters projection}} shows accurate surface area, but with distorted (\"awful\") shapes.\n|-\n|Scandanavia\n| A typo of {{w|Scandinavia}}. The area shown includes Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark, but the actual area of Scandinavia excludes Finland. The Scandinavian peninsula countries include Norway, Finland, and Sweden, and those can be collectively (and nerdily) referred to as \"Fennoscandia.\"\n|-\n| Western Europe\nEastern Europe\n| The line here approximately follows that of the {{w|Iron Curtain}} that separated the {{w|Warsaw Pact}} states (the Soviet Union and other Communist allies) from the {{w|NATO}} (US-allied) and neutral states. However, all of Germany is included in Western Europe (when during the Cold War it was divided into East and West Germany) while Austria (which was officially neutral in the Cold War but closely tied to the West and therefore blocked off from its Communist neighbors) is marked as Eastern Europe. Here, Eastern Europe also includes the {{w|Balkans}} (the southern peninsula east of Italy), which are usually considered separate. During the Cold War, the Balkans were divided between Soviet-allied Albania (which later left the Pact) and Bulgaria, NATO-allied Greece and Turkey, and Yugoslavia, which was a neutral Communist state. It's also worth noting that there should be a blob of Russian red in the middle of Eastern Europe, representing the Russian exclave of {{w|Kaliningrad oblast}}.\n|-\n| British Isles\nIreland\n| Although {{w|Ireland}} belongs to the {{w|British Isles}} geographically, it does not belong to the {{w|British Islands}} politically. That may be the reason why Ireland is labeled additionally — to show it's known that Ireland does not belong to the {{w|United Kingdom}}. {{w|Northern Ireland}} does, though.\n|-\n| Rainforest DRC\n| The area shown is actually not completely the {{w|Democratic Republic of the Congo}} (DRC), but since one of the persons who made this map says they don't know the African map very well (see statement below), it's fairly accurate. Also the area called rainforest is somewhat larger than the area depicted as {{w|tropical rainforest}} on Wikipedia, although this might be due to {{w|deforestation}} and {{w|desertification in Africa}}\n|-\n| So this is one of those things where you point out our ignorance and stereotypes?\nYeah – I mean I freely admit I don’t know the African map very well, which speaks volumes in itself.\n| Here two of the persons involved in drawing this map discusses what their lack of knowledge about Africa says about them. The African portion of the map is for sure the most poorly labeled, which lends weight to the stereotype of the 'Ignorant American'. Although it has to be mentioned, that the geography of Africa is in general not well known — at least within the Western world. So that's not really an American thing, here. The few countries which are labeled here mostly are well known because of their unstable political situation or because of their remarkable location. The labeled locations (and the presumably reasons of their \"publicity\") are west to east, north to south: {{w|Morocco}} ({{w|Arab Spring}}, location), {{w|Algeria}} (Arab Spring, {{w|Algerian Civil War|Civil War}}), {{w|Sahara|Sahara Desert}} (largest hot desert of the world), {{w|Sudan}} ({{w|Second Sudanese Civil War|Civil war}}, Arab Spring), {{w|West Africa}} ({{w|West Africa#Postcolonial eras|Lots of Civil wars}} and thus bad humanitarian situation, {{w|Blood diamond|Blood diamonds}}), {{w|Somalia}} ({{w|Somali Civil War|Civil war}}, {{w|Piracy in Somalia|pirates}}), {{w|Lake Victoria}} (largest lake of Africa, quite remarkable even at large scale maps (as here)), {{w|Mozambique}} ({{w|Mozambican Civil War|Civil war}}), {{w|Angola}} ({{w|Angolan Civil War|Civil War}}) and {{w|Madagascar}} (one of the world's large islands, at the east coast — quite remarkable).\n|-\n| Cape Horn\n| {{w|Cape Horn}} is the southern tip of ''South America'', not ''Africa''. The southern tip of Africa is called {{w|Cape Agulhas}}.\n|-\n| Should we include {{w|Antarctica}}?\nLet’s not – these guys are looking impatient\n| Here it is made clear that those who came with this assignment are getting impatient since their project of proving how little Americans know about the world has failed miserably. It also shows that if some labels or parts are missing, then it could be because of this and not for lack of knowledge. This is also a joke on the lack of labels that would be required for the map of Antarctica. Drawing Antarctica and labeling it would probably take less time than having the discussion about whether to include it, and then writing that discussion on the map.\n|-\n| {{w|Aral Sea}} (Gone)\n| Formerly one of the largest fresh-water lakes of the world, now actually not completely gone, but almost.\n|-\n| Various former Soviet states\n| Which are (west to east) {{w|Kazakhstan}}, {{w|Turkmenistan}}, {{w|Uzbekistan}}, {{w|Tajikistan}} and {{w|Kyrgyzstan}}. The former {{w|Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics}} was dissolved in 1991 and thus the {{w|Cold War}} ended.\n|-\n| Middle East\n| Drawn here to include {{w|Egypt}} and {{w|Turkey}}. Whether these should be included depends on whether you mean the phrase ''Middle East'' politically or geographically. They are both Muslim countries, but geographically Egypt is in Africa and Turkey is usually not included because of its close affiliation with Europe.\n|-\n| Boxing Day quake\nWait, \"Boxing Day\"? There’s no way you’re American.\n\nI read BBC News, OK?\n| On December 26, 2004, a {{w|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|huge earthquake}} struck off the coast of Indonesia, causing severe tsunamis. December 26, the day after {{w|Christmas Day}}, is celebrated as {{w|Boxing Day}} in the UK, Canada, Australia, and some other English-speaking countries, but not the US. As such, the earthquake became known as the Boxing Day Quake.\nOne of the people who came asked these people to draw this map picks up on the use of 'Boxing Day' as something no American would say and questions if this person is, in fact, American. But an American reader of {{w|BBC News}} (part of the British Broadcasting Corporation) may start to use the phrase \"Boxing Day\" about the Tsunami.\n|-\n| India -> Mostly Muslim\nIndia -> Mostly Hindu\n| In general {{w|India}} is separated in {{w|Religion in India|two religious groups}}. Muslims in the north-west, Hindus in the rest. As visible on the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Religion_in_India.svg map] in Wikimedia Commons, the area with a predominant Muslim population is far smaller (and mostly concentrated to Kashmir) than depicted in the comic.\n|-\n| Tibet (contested)\n| The area was annexed by the {{w|People's Republic of China}} in the 1950s. Since then there are {{w|Tibetan independence movement|moves to gain}} some degree or other of independence. The marked area is fairly inaccurate, though. Today's {{w|Tibet Autonomous Region}} (former {{w|Kingdom of Tibet}}) is roughly the southern half of the marked area extended a bit to the south-east.\n|-\n| Kamchatka Peninsula, but I admit I only know this one from Risk\n|''{{w|Risk (game)|Risk}}'' is a board game played on a map of the world, where players own territories and battle each other for world domination. The person in the comic admits to knowing {{w|Kamchatka Peninsula}} only from the territory \"Kamchatka\" in the game. Kamchatka is notable among the territories in the game because it and Alaska are connected, despite being on opposite sides of the board — a fact that can easily be overlooked.\n|-\n| Koreas\n| The two Koreas are the \"{{w|Democratic People's Republic of Korea}}\" (North Korea) and the \"{{w|Republic of Korea}}\" (South Korea). \n|-\n| Japan, duh.\n| Well...{{w|Japan}}.\n|-\n| Taiwan (actually called \"The Republic of China\" – it's complicated).\n| This is a reference to the complicated political history of {{w|Taiwan}}. After the {{w|Chinese Civil War}}, the Nationalists fled {{w|mainland China}} for the island of Taiwan and set up a {{w|martial law in Taiwan|martial law}} there, vowing to return. In the intervening 70 years or so, Taiwan eventually began to transform into a democracy, being a self-governing state in its own right, but hasn't shed the name, or the animosity with the new rulers of mainland China. According to Americans, China and Taiwan are {{w|Taiwan Relations Act#Since 2000|separate countries}}, but many other nations do not feel able to treat with the latter to that degree, given the political pressures from the former. The government of China claims ''de jure'' {{w|Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty of Taiwan}}, even though there is ''de facto'' separation of governance, and the island is not represented as a sovereign territory by the United Nations …hence the \"it's complicated\" tag. There is also a missing end-paren here, which is likely a typo. The tag \"it's complicated\" is one of the options for relationship statuses on Facebook, and denotes two people whose relationship defies the usual labels. In this case, it is the relationship between the \"countries\" which is complicated.\n|-\n| Sulawesi\n| As a running gag, the island of {{w|Sulawesi}} (formerly known as Celebes) is depicted in several map-like drawings and charts (see [[256: Online Communities]], [[273: Electromagnetic Spectrum]], [[802: Online Communities 2]], and [[1555: Exoplanet Names 2]]). Of course, there are good reasons to show it on an actual world map like the one here.\n|-\n| Paupa New Guinea\n| A spelling mistake of {{w|Papua New Guinea}}.\n|-\n| Phillipines\n| A spelling mistake of the {{w|Philippines}}.\n|-\n| Southeast Asia\n| {{w|Southeast Asia}} is a region in Asia, which includes Buddhist-majority countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, Muslim-majority countries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, and Christian-majority countries of the Philippines and Timor-Leste. However, in this map, Indonesia is depicted separately from the rest of SE Asia.\n|-\n| Malaysia\n| Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia (it is not known why it was excluded on the map) \n|-\n| Indonesia\n| Indonesia is another country in Southeast Asia (it is not known why it was excluded on the map).\n|-\n| Sri Lanka\n| Sri Lanka is a small island country near India.\n|-\n| Tasmania\n| Tasmania is an Australian state.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:THE WORLD\n:According to a Group of\n:'''AMERICANS'''\n:who turned out to be unexpectedly good at geography, derailing our attempt to illustrate their country's attitude toward the rest of the world.\n\n:[Left to right, up to down.]\n\n:[North of Canada.] Hey so what projection should we use?\n:I'll aim for \"Robinson.\"\n\n:[North America.] Alaska; Canada; Hudson Bay; Québec; United States\n:Did you know Maine is actually the US state closest to Africa?; Bermuda (British!)\n\n:[Central America.] Baja California (Mexico); Mexico; Central America; Panama Canal; Gulf of Mexico; Cuba; Hispañola; POR.; Jamaica\n:Do we have to label all the Virgin Islands?\n\n:[South America.] Rest of South America (spanish-speaking); Brazil (portugese-speaking); French, and I think Dutch and English; Tierra del Fuego\n\n:[Greenland.] Greenland (still too big!); Yeah but the Peters map is awful; Iceland\n\n:[Europe.] British Isles; [https://iecasimile.com/ Ireland]; Gibralter; Scandanavia; Western Europe; Eastern Europe; Black sea; Middle East\n\n:[Africa.] Morocco; Algera; Sahara Desert; West Africa; Sudan; Rainforest DRC; Lake Victoria; Somalia; Angola; Mozambique; South Africa; Cape Horn; Madagascar\n\n:[West of DRC.] So this is one of those things where you point out our ignorance and stereotypes?\n:Yeah – I mean, I freely admit I don't know the African map very well, which speaks volumes in itself.\n\n:[West Asia.] Russia; Aral sea (Gone); Various former Soviet states; Afghanistan & Pakistan; India; Mostly Muslim; Mostly Hindu\n\n:[Indian Ocea.] Sri Lanka; Boxing Day Quake\n:Wait, \"Boxing day\"?
