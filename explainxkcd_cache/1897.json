A reCAPTCHA version of this puzzle would ask \"check all squares containing a STOP SIGN\" using one or more images derived from {{w|Google Street View}}.\n\nSuch an approach can serve to create the learning set as the basis for training an {{w|artificial intelligence}} (AI) to better recognize or respond to similar stimuli. This approach was used by Google, the owners of reCAPTCHA, to identify house numbers in Street View to improve their mapping, and nowadays Google also uses CAPTCHAs to identify vehicles, street signs and other objects in Street View pictures. This might be a reasonable way to help improve the performance of the AI in a self-driving car that responds to video input, by reviewing images it might encounter and flagging road signs, etc. that it should respond to. Later a similar approach to learning important things, for the robots, was used in [[2228: Machine Learning Captcha]].\n\nHowever, the temptation might be to simply sidestep the hard problem of AI by having all instances 'solved' by \"offloading [the] work onto random strangers\" through CAPTCHAs.  For example, this has been used to defeat CAPTCHAs themselves; people were asked to solve CAPTCHAs to unlock pornographic images in a computer game, while the solution for the CAPTCHA was relayed to a server belonging to cybercriminals. (See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7067962.stm PC stripper helps spam to spread] and [https://doi.org/10.1016/S1353-4858(08)70036-9 Humans + porn = solved CAPTCHA]).\n\nAlarmingly, the developers of this '{{w|Self-driving car|self driving}}' car seem to have gone for the lazy approach.  Instead of teaching an AI, the CAPTCHA answer is used in real time to check whether the \"self-driving\" car is about to arrive at an intersection with a stop sign. This information is pretty critical, as failing to mark the stop could cause an accident. The user is unlikely to respond to the CAPTCHA in time to avert disaster, not to mention that any interruption to the car's internet connection could prove fatal. [[:Category:Self-driving cars|Self driving cars]] have become a recurrent theme on xkcd.\n\nThe system depicted is a {{w|Wizard of Oz experiment}} (as is the \"Mechanical Turk\" which a popular crowdworking system is named after) whereas actual self-driving cars, to the extent that they can use reCAPTCHA-style human detection systems, would involve an asynchronous decision system. Other synchronous decision systems which actually exist are political voting and money as a token of the exchange value of trade. \n\nThe title text explains that this method could be called \"crowdsourced steering\", {{w|crowdsourcing}} meaning sending the data on the internet to let several users provide their ideas and input on a problem. People would naturally suspect that this is considerably less safe than a car which is actually capable of self-driving; if the internet can barely [[1333: First Date|collectively steer a videogame character]], what chance do they have steering an actual, physical vehicle?\n\nThis also suggests that [[Randall]] is a bit skeptical of the current stage of AI, as this doubts whether the AI technology really is working in the way that we expect. It also comments on how what we call 'progress' actually is putting our work onto other people.\n\nAs of November 2024, [https://arxiv.org/html/2409.08831v1 reCAPTCHA v2 is beaten].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Inside a frame there is the following text above an image:]\n:To complete your registration, please tell us whether or not this image contains a stop sign:\n\n:[The square image is a drawing of a road leading up to a sign post with a hard to read word at the top part of the eight-sided sign. The sign also has two smaller signs left and right with unreadable text. The image is grayscale and of poor quality, but trees and other obstacles next to the road can be seen.
