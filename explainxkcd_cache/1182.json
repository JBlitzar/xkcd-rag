You didn't see the one of Whistler's mother!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Rembrandt}} was a 17th-century Dutch artist. [[Megan]] shows [[Cueball]] an alleged photo of Rembrandt's parents at the time that his mother became pregnant; his {{w|human conception|conception}}. Since photography wasn't invented until the 19th century, it can't be a real photo. Megan responds to Cueball's disbelief by stating that it is an artist's conception: an artistic imagination and depiction of an event.\n\nThe joke thus is a pun on the phrase 'artist's conception' that can mean two different things: one, Rembrandt's mother becoming pregnant with him and two, the creation of the image.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|James McNeill Whistler}} who painted a portrait of his mother, known to Whistler himself as \"Arrangement in Grey and Black No1\" but more commonly known as \"{{w|Whistler's Mother}}\". As a joke on this, Megan seems to want to show a photo of Whistler's mother, which would probably be pornographic or at least different from the famous portrait. The ::click:: is Megan switching to that picture on her laptop.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is holding a laptop. Cueball is sitting at a desk and turned around to face Megan.]\n:Megan: Hey, look - Rembrandt's parents having sex!\n:Cueball: ''Waugh!'' Why do you-\n:Cueball: ...Wait, how can there be a photo of that?\n:Megan: It's an artist's conception.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Photography]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
