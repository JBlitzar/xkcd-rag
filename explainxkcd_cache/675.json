Hint: it's the one that involves less work.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic contrasts brilliant revolutionary scientific thought with the simplistic arrogance of assuming one understands the current scientific theory enough to correct it, known under the {{w|Dunning-Kruger effect}}. The character with the goatee has a degree in {{w|philosophy}}, and perhaps has certain ideas of his own about how the world should fundamentally be described by physics. He has studied Einstein's {{w|theory of special relativity}} for about an hour and thinks he has found a flaw. When confronted about this, he considers the objection as based in {{w|dogma}}, and remains so confident that he wants to email the \"president of physics\". His ignorance of the field is emphasized by thinking that the entire field of physics has a president - although certain important organizations such as the {{w|American Physical Society}} do have presidents.\n\n[[Cueball]] concedes that it is possible for such a revolutionary idea to come from a relative outsider. One example is {{w|Albert Einstein}}'s own formulation of {{w|special relativity}}, which came while he was working at a patent office in Switzerland, although he did already have a Ph.D in physics. A {{w|thought experiment}} considers some hypothesis, theory, or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences.\n\nThe \"racecar on a train\" idea alludes to thought experiments involving {{w|Frame_of_reference#Simple_example|frames of reference}}, which are important in relativity. Special relativity was famously established using some thought experiments about moving objects. However, some searchers elaborated more complicated thought experiments and claimed they had proven relativity was self-contradictory. Examples include {{w|twin paradox}} (both of the twins are younger than the other, until you stop assuming acceleration phases can be neglected) or {{w|ladder paradox}} (ladder is both smaller and larger than the garage, until you consider seriously the problems with defining simultaneity for remote locations in relativity). Apparently the philosopher complicated Einstein's train thought experiment by adding a racecar, and found contradictions which prove special relativity is inconsistent. However, the most likely scenario is that the \"racecar on a train\" is too complicated for him to find correct conclusions.\n\nA highly complex case may be impossible to prove consistent with relativity using intuition alone: complete solving involves calculation using Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe title text is posing a question about the likelihood of two scenarios (possibly to the person with the philosophy degree):\n*That decades of work by numerous physicists is fundamentally incorrect, and I found the flaw immediately\n*That I need to read a little more\n\nThis might be a self-referential title text as this question could be considered a simple thought experiment. The philosopher should be able to overturn his theory using this simple thought experiment which reflects the second panel. While his theory is not widely believed, the joke is that the philosopher could overturn his first thought experiment (racecar on train) with this thought experiment.\n\n[[Randall]] hints that believing you have found fundamental flaws in a theory is much easier than doing more research on it. This is possibly a statement about using {{w|Occam's Razor}} in arguments, which says the simpler answer is the more likely one, which is commonly brought up in {{w|Philosophy|philosophy}}. Usually, when someone with little understanding of the subject thinks that they have found a flaw, it takes only a little bit more reading to discover that the flaw is in fact completely explained already.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Yes, science is an open process in which a good idea can come from anybody.\n\n:Cueball: Yes, widely-believed theories are ''on occasion'' overturned by simple thought experiments.\n\n:Cueball: And yes, your philosophy degree equips you to ask interesting questions sometimes.\n\n:[Cueball is talking to a philosopher with a goatee, who is sitting at a computer.]\n:Cueball: But you did not just overturn special relativity, a subject you learned about an hour ago, with your \"racecar on a train\" idea.\n:Philosopher: You just don't like that I'm turning a rational eye to your dogma. Hey, what's the email for the president of physics?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
