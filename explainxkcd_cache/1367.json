The apps wouldn't stay on the phone all the time; instead, the phone would download each app again every time the user wanted to run it.\n\nHowever, web pages and {{w|web application}}s already work like this. Clicking a link will make the browser download a web page and render {{w|HTML|HTML code}} and {{w|JavaScript}} that it links to.\n\nThe page usually isn't saved long-term on the user's computer; instead, the browser downloads it again when needed. {{w|HTML5}} does however offer the option of {{w|Cache_manifest_in_HTML5|caching web application files locally}} so it can remain operational when there is no network connection.\n\nIn the title text, Cueball's idea for local application storage already exists in the HTTP protocol as {{w|HTTP cookie|cookies}}. The more flexible {{w|Web storage|web storage}} was originally part of the HTML5 specification, but it's now in a separate specification.\n\nNative phone applications and web applications are not completely interchangeable. Web applications may not allow access to more advanced or platform-specific resources. Projects like {{w|Apache Cordova}} make these resources available to web applications by creating a native application wrapper for the web application.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are standing next to each other.]\n:Cueball: Installing things has gotten so fast and painless.\n:Cueball: Why not skip it entirely, and make a phone that has every app \"installed\" already and just downloads and runs them on the fly?\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I felt pretty clever until I realized I'd invented webpages.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Smartphones]]"
