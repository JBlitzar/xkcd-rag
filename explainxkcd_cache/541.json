    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 541\n| date      = February 9, 2009\n| title     = TED Talk\n| image     = ted_talk.png\n| titletext = The IAU ban came after the 'redefinition of the 'planet' to include the IAU president's mom' incident.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comics shows Randall as a presenter at the highly prestigious {{w|TED conference}}, a symposium about technology, entertainment and design. The illustrious {{w|list of TED speakers|list of former presenters}} includes amongst others Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Larry Page, Richard Dawkins and Gordon Brown. The conference is regarded as a forum for {{w|digerati}}. Every talk has a length of at most 20 minutes and is supposed to be as captivating as possible. Randall's presentation, however, reduces the purpose of the conference to absurdity: The topic he wishes to point out to his listeners, is that of how to put an emoticon at the end of a parenthetical statement. One possibility that is shown is \"Linux (or BSD :)\", which looks mismatched because the emoji does not close the opening parenthesis. The other one, \"Linux (or BSD :))\" has a closing parenthesis, but makes the emoticon look double-chinned. \n\nThis question is of little practical consequence, although it received a lot of attention after publication of the comic. In the last panel, the TED conference is another item to add to his list of conferences from which he has been banned. On the list are other conferences from all sorts of fields, including every American {{w|furry convention}}. The title text about Randall's ban from the {{w|IAU}} conference is a reference to the popular maternal insults called {{w|\"Yo mama\" joke}}s. A common representative of the genre runs \"Yo mama so fat, scientists have declared her the 10th planet.\" Those kinds of jokes are a [[:Category:Your Mom|recurring theme]] on xkcd. Unpaired parentheses would later be mentioned again in [[859: (]].\n\nIt can be inferred from [[629: Skins]], that Randall was banned from North American furry conventions due to being a \"Skin\", which is a furry whose fursona prefers going around disguised as a human.  Depending on Randall's behavior, such an action could generate a lot of drama and, presumably, lead to convention bans. Getting banned from attending a conference is a [[:Category:Banned from conferences|recurring theme]] on xkcd, and even in real life, Randall sometimes has bad ideas for conference topics, [https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/02/11/ireland/ such as presumably not speaking for the entire conference]. This was so far the sixth of eight comics to directly mention conference bans. The first to do so was [[153: Cryptography]].\n\n===Conferences where Randall is banned from===\nThese are the conferences from which Randall has been banned according to this comic.\n\n; [http://www.siggraph.org Siggraph]: Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques.\n\n; [http://www.iacr.org/meetings/eurocrypt/ Eurocrypt]: Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques.\n\n; [https://www.defcon.org/ Defcon]: DEF CON® Hacking Conference.\n\n; [http://www.pycon.org/ Pycon]: Python Conference.\n\n; [https://www.iau.org/science/meetings/ International Astronomical Union]: The IAU's mission is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation.\n\n; [http://www.gacpaleodivision.com/pd-meetings.html Canadian Paleontology Conference]: The main goal of the CPC and its predecessors has been to provide a relatively small, informal forum for presentation and discussion of current paleontological research.\n\n; [http://fclr.info/ Every American Furry Convention]: There are many Furry Conventions in America (see the {{w|List of furry conventions|Wikipedia page}} for more details), but to be banned from all of them would probably require action by the Furry Convention Leadership Roundtable, the coordinating body for furry conventions.\n\n; [http://www.americanbakers.org/meetings/ American Baking Society (American Bakers Association)]: ABA represents the interests of bakers before the U.S. Congress, federal agencies, and international regulatory authorities.\n\n; [https://www.imata.org/ Asian Dolphin-Training Conference]: International Marine Animal Trainers' Association.\n\n; [https://ted.com TED]: Technology, Entertainment, Design.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Randall, drawn as Cueball, on stage.]\n:Randall: Hi. I'm Randall. Welcome to my TED talk.\n:Randall: It's an honor to speak to you, some of the brightest innovators from so many fields, about a problem in desperate need of your attention:\n:Randall: How DO you end parenthetical statements with emoticons? I can't figure out a good way.\n:[Screen next to him shows two statements, both crossed out in red.]\n:\"Linux (or BSD :) would...\" looks mismatched\n:\"Linux (or BSD :)) would...\" looks mismatched and weird\n\n:[Randall writing on a desk.]\n:[Randall's List] Conferences I'm banned from:\n:Siggraph\n:Eurocrypt\n:Defcon\n:Pycon\n:International Astronomical Union\n:Canadian Paleontology Conference\n:Every American Furry Convention\n:American Baking Society\n:Asian Dolphin-Training Conference\n:<u>TED</u>\n\n==Trivia==\n*After the release of this comic, Randall has given a TED talk in March 2014. [https://www.ted.com/talks/randall_munroe_comics_that_ask_what_if Randall Munroe Comics that ask \"what if?\"].\n\n*This was the [[:Category:Comics with red annotations|first comic with red annotations]], albeit this time being in-universe, rather than the later typical use for comic-level commentary.\n\n===PyCon response===\nIn response to this comic, PyCon organizers jokingly [http://pycon.blogspot.com/2009/02/randall-munroe.html announced] that Randall Munroe was banned from PyCon 2009 due to \"last year's disgraceful keynote, '{{w|Web crawler|Web Spiders}} vs. [[Red Spiders]]'.\" They also said they instructed their volunteers to refuse admission to him and \"any stick figures who may attempt to register, particularly if they are [[:Category:Characters with hats|wearing hats]].\"\n\nMessages on the PyCon-Organizers mailing list show that this joke was intended to get Randall to come to PyCon: (The links will only work if you're subscribed to the mailing list.)\n:PyCon mentioned briefly in today's xkcd:\n:http://xkcd.com/541/\n:We've still never gotten Randall Munroe to actually attend, have we? Anybody want to take charge of twisting his arm this time?  I think we can still offer him a \"press pass\" (free registration).

[http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/pycon-organizers/2009-February/011226.html]\n::::Confirming the ban is far funnier... He's definitely a disturbing influence on programmers.

He didn't seem super psyched, but then again emotions are hard to read via IRC.\n:::::::I love the idea of \"officially\" banning him, however. ;-) [http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/pycon-organizers/2009-February/011241.html]\n::::::::(a few posts later)\n::::::::OK - posted to the PyCon blog, by the power vested in me as publicity chair.  With Michael Foord's excellent sentence added.\n::::::::Now let him know that since he's banned, he HAS to come.
