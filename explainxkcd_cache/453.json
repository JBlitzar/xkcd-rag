It's just a matter of time.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic gives ludicrous and ironic upcoming {{w|Tropical cyclone|hurricane}} paths on an unlabelled map of the {{w|Americas}} that shows the region roughly between central {{w|Canada}} and northern {{w|South America}}. Blue and red dotted lines indicate the future hurricane paths.\n\n===Hurricanes===\n====Hurricane Where-The-Hell-Is-Bermuda====\nEnters from the east side of the map, wanders around the {{w|Atlantic Ocean}} in a scribble that seems to take the shape of an {{w|Ampersand}}. Then it goes north for a while, and then peters out without entering the {{w|Bermuda Triangle}}. The Bermuda Triangle is a location in the Atlantic Ocean loosely framed by the three corners {{w|Bermuda}}, {{w|Miami}}, and {{w|Puerto Rico}}. The myth is that (too) many ships and planes get lost once they enter inside the area of this triangle and disappear without a trace. In this case, the hurricane gets lost before entering and can't even find the triangle. It may also simply be a reference to the statistic that Bermuda is affected by {{w|List of Bermuda hurricanes|many Atlantic hurricanes}}, and that this hurricane got lost on its way to its target.\n\n====Hurricane Illinois-Has-It-Too-Easy====\nComes from somewhere to the north-west, goes through {{w|Illinois}}, and then back to the north-west. Illinois is located far from the ocean, and thus suffers few hurricanes{{Citation needed}} - this particular one is extremely unlikely, and according to the name, exists purely so that Illinois will have a hurricane to deal with. Interestingly enough (though it did not affect the Chicago area or correspond with the path displayed in the comic), roughly one year later, a {{w|Derecho|super derecho}}, a storm resembling a hurricane or tropical storm in movement and form, {{w|May 2009 Southern Midwest derecho|struck}} central and South Illinois, in addition to much of {{w|Missouri}} and {{w|Kansas}}. Also, while it had never reached hurricane strength, {{w|Tropical storms Amanda and Cristobal#Cristobal|Tropical Storm Cristobal}}'s center tracked over Illinois (and then Iowa) before becoming extratropical, and other tropical and post-tropical cycles have affected Illinois. For example, while its center did not pass over Illinois, {{w|Hurricane Audrey#Elsewhere in the United States|Hurricane Audrey}} dropped over ten inches of rain in some parts of Illinois before becoming extratropical, flooding highways there for three days.\n\n====Hurricane Freud====\nRefers to {{w|Sigmund Freud}}, who believed that accidental sexual expression was a reflection of the unconscious mind's sexual desires. The hurricane's path forms a pair of testicles beside Florida. Florida, due to its shape and location, resembles a penis,{{Citation needed}} and the hurricane's shape and position exemplify Freud's ideas.\n\n====Hurricane Screw-It-Let's-Just-Trash-Florida-Again====\nComes from the east, starts to curve to the north, and then turns sharply to head straight for Florida and zigzag through it four times before dying out. Sticking out from the rest of the US, Florida is prone to hurricanes from the East, South, and West. And with the state not being very high or wide, it is common for a hurricane to run over Florida, lose some strength, then rebuild strength over the hot waters in the Gulf of Mexico, only to do a U-turn and strike again. This is not exactly what happens with this particular hurricane, where it turns out into the Atlantic Ocean again each time, suggesting a malicious intent.\n\n====Hurricane Red and Hurricane Blue====\nBlue is the only hurricane path drawn in blue. The two hurricanes are playing a game zipping in straight lines and right angles around {{w|Haiti}}, {{w|Jamaica}}, and {{w|Cuba}}. When ''Red'' successfully cuts off ''Blue'', the latter instantly dies, and then ''Red'' dies shortly thereafter. The game they play is the game of {{w|Tron_(video_game)#Light_Cycles|Light Cycles}} from the {{w|Tron_(video_game)|video game}} based on the movie ''{{w|Tron}}''. ''Hurricane Blue'' lost because it crashed into the wall of light left by ''Hurricane Red's'' {{w|Light_Cycle#Light_cycles|light cycle}}. (Note that real hurricanes are not dotted lines{{Citation needed}}; the two hurricanes would have merged long before Hurricane Blue \"lost.\")\n\n====Hurricane cos(x)====\nForms a curve in the shape of a {{w|sinusoid}} above the bottom edge of the map. Its path resembles a {{w|sine}} wave. This kind of {{w|trigonometric functions}} can, however, both be expressed as sin(x) or cos(x), the latter being a {{w|cosine wave}}. They look exactly the same when there is no clearly defined coordinate system as in this case. Given this oscillates between six and ten degrees north (using Paramaribo and the southern shore of \nTrinidad as references) perhaps this hurricane might be better described as Hurricane 2 cos (x) + 8.\n\n===Title Text===\nThe title text refers to the {{w|1938 New England hurricane}} (also known as the Long Island Express) that caused $4.7 billion in damage. Had it been further west, it could have caused more damage, as the right side of a hurricane is stronger and more destructive than the left side, as the winds on the right side push water inland. [[Randall]] asks for more damage assessments for such a hurricane that would be able to flood {{w|Manhattan}} in {{w|New York}}. Only four years after this cartoon was published, making it almost prophetic, {{w|Hurricane Sandy}} did strike the {{w|New York metropolitan area|New Yorkâ€“New Jersey area}} as a {{w|post-tropical cyclone}} storm. Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated $74 billion in damage. \n\nThe 1938 hurricane is also [[980:_Money/Transcript#Disasters|referenced]] in [[980: Money]], where it is calculated that it would have caused $78 billion had it happened in 2011. However, if that hurricane had taken the same turn as Sandy did, the cost today could have been a staggering $237 billion.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[An unlabelled map shows the region roughly between central Canada and northernmost parts of South America.
