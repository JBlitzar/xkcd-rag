In the comic, the man wearing sunglasses parodies the song \"{{w|99 Problems}}\" in which the rapper {{w|Jay-Z}} says:\n\n:If you're havin' girl problems\n:I feel bad for you, son-\n:I got 99 problems,\n:But a bitch ain't one.\n\nIn the comic however, the rapper tries to solve his problems with Perl's regular expressions, and ends up only creating another problem for himself, which is a reference to a [http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247 famous quote by Jamie Zawinski] (whose name could also be shortened to \"Jay-Z\"): \"Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems.\" (This quote was revisited in [[1313: Regex Golf]].)\n\n\"program --help\" is a common way, originating with the GNU project, to ask a program to show documentation on its usage and supported parameters; which, for some program, could include a \"-z\" command-line argument (\"flag\"), so the command would read \"jay -z\". In this case, it is just an obvious play on the rapper's name. [http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/projects/lp/doc/jay/package-summary.html '''jay'''] is also an actual C program that is a compiler-compiler for java, but it doesn't have a \"-z\" flag.\n\nThis sort of problematically recursive [[:Category:Self-reference|self-reference]] is reminiscent of comic [[927: Standards]], and [[1739: Fixing Problems]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Man with sunglasses talking (or, alternatively, rapping) to Cueball.]\n:Sunglasses: If you're havin' perl problems I feel bad for you, son-\n\n:Sunglasses: I got 99 problems,\n\n:Sunglasses: So I used regular expressions.\n\n:Sunglasses: Now I have 100 problems.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Regex]]"
