If the mass somehow is compressed into this volume, it becomes so dense that it forms a {{w|black hole}}. The Schwarzschild radius corresponding to the mass of the Earth is about 0.35 inches (roughly 9 mm, or a diameter of 7/10\" or 18 mm), meaning that if you could compress the Earth into a ball that small, it would be a black hole. The object at bottom right in the comic, with a triangular warning sign next to it, is a {{w|Black hole#Observation|depiction of a black hole}}.\n\n{{w|Globes}}, in this context, are miniature re-creations of planet Earth, used to show its features without any of the [[977: Map Projections|typical problems of a flat map]]. [[Randall]] claims that safety standards are in place to ensure that globes are not manufactured at, below, or even close to the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth which implies that the Schwarzschild radius and black hole formation is less a function of mass, but instead based on the ''concept'' of spatial bodies like planets and stars. A scale model of Earth will gain the Schwarzschild radius of the full size Earth because in the XKCD universe Earth-like-things (and presumably representations of other planets and stars) have Schwarzschild radii because that's the way they are.\n\nAn alternate interpretation is that any globe of the Earth shares the same mass as the Earth and hence the same Schwarzschild radius. Such a globe might be made by creating a literal 1:1 replica of Earth and then shrinking it without distortion until it has the required size (possibly by removing some of the \"empty space\" inside atoms). This would, of course, give the most perfect maps; however, for each globe made the Earth's mass would increase by its original amount. In addition it would be impossible to use an Earth-mass globe since something of that density would immediately burrow through the real Earth's crust and proceed to the center of planet. \n\nThe title text doubles down on the joke, suggesting that globes up to 12 inches (about 30 centimeters) should be banned, due to their extreme gravitational fields. Again, the implication is that representations of Earth would also gain the actual Earth's gravitational properties or would see those properties as a result of actually having an Earth-like mass.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A standard globe of the Earth is shown. It stands on a typical stand which holds it by two arms at the poles, so it can turn around like the Earth does. The Earth is turned so it shows Australia at the bottom and most of Asia, including the entire India to the left. Only the very tip of Alaska can be seen of the Americas. Above the globe there is a double ended arrow that goes to two small lines that align with the edges of the globe (indicating the diameter). The arrow has been split in the middle and two lines of text are written in the gap. Above this text there is another line of text.]\n:Remember:\n:4 inches minimum\n\n:[Beneath the globe there are two small drawings. The left shows the Earth and to the left of the Earth there is a double ended arrow ending at two lines that indicated the diameter of the Earth going from top to bottom. The distance of this is written in inches to the left. From the Earth an arrow points to another drawing, this time the typical depiction of a black hole, with a \"hat\" like shape. A triangular warning sign is shown a the top right of the black hole with an exclamation mark inside.]\n:7/10\"\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:The Earth's Schwarzschild radius is about 0.35 inches, which is why safety regulations require desktop globes to be at least 4 inches in diameter.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Maps]]"
