It can remain unspoiled for a person's entire lifetime, making it practically nonperishable for ordinary consumers. It is frequently claimed that archaeologists have found jars of honey that have been well-preserved for thousands of years in ancient tombs, often those found in {{w|Egyptian pyramids}}, hence the title ''Pyramid Honey''. The claims are generally assertions that may point to other similar assertions as supporting evidence but do not provide specific details, such as the identity of the actual tombs where such jars have been found, or the names of the archaeologists who have affirmed finding such jars. Repeated encounters with the assertion lead some people to claim that honey's shelf life is \"infinite\", which is a much stronger claim which would not necessarily be supported by the assertion even assuming it is true.\n\nIn the comic, [[Cueball]] tells [[Megan]] about an article in ''{{w|Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine}}'' (presumably [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-science-behind-honeys-eternal-shelf-life-1218690/ this one]) that claims honey has an infinite shelf life. The article links to a book that makes the assertion of such findings but does not provide factual support of the findings. Megan thinks the source for this article, and others that covered the subject, is wrong and wants to refute them all. She tells Cueball ''Believe it or not'' which [[Black Hat]] hears and he immediately states that he believes her, and is convinced without hearing any arguments from Megan. He then decides to begin a Facebook page so he can ''tell the Internet'' without giving Megan a chance to explain any further.\n\n\"A hill to die on\" is a phrase from {{w|Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway's}} 1940 novel \"{{w|For Whom the Bell Tolls}}\", about an American who volunteers in the 1936-1939 {{w|Spanish Civil War}} to fight {{w|fascism}}, who ends up wounded and alone, about to ambush the enemy to give his comrades a chance to escape; \"a weird hill to die on\" would thus mean a weird cause, if not a just one, to fight for to the bitter end. This expression is also the subject of [[2247: Weird Hill]]. Black Hat asserts that he needs such a cause because the \"real\" weird hills are too far from his house, humorously implying he would be equally satisfied with a literal weird hill.\n\nBlack Hat's actions are clearly premature since he has not heard any evidence to back up the claim and does not understand the nuances of Megan's position. Cueball states that it could have gone better, whereas Megan seems to be resigned to it, perhaps as it notionally supports her (aborted) argument and it's at least a short-term 'win' that she won't fuss over the details of.\n\nPresumably, the best Black Hat can do would be to parrot what he has heard from Megan, without any understanding or critical thinking on his part. Due to his lack of understanding, he may even interject his own ideas (ones Megan never believed nor stated) into his posts. These are all consistent with him calling himself \"pyramid honey truther\". The word ''truther'' refers to people who reject established facts and instead choose to believe in conspiracies, like people who claim {{w|Moon landing conspiracy theories|the moon landings never happened}}, or {{w|9/11 Truth movement|believe the US government is behind}} the {{w|9/11 attacks}}. While a few conspiracy theories turn out to be true, most are easily proved to be fake, but this does not stop people from believing in them anyway, just like the two mentioned here, which are not easily dismissed by believers. This turns Megan, who likely has a reasonable and well-justified position, unwillingly into the source of conspiracy theories.\n\nAlternatively, he only does this to troll Megan (and Cueball), and everyone else that reads his Facebook page, just because he knows they will get annoyed. And also to state that this is an unimportant subject (a weird hill to die on) to make such a fuss over. No one would wish to eat that honey, anyway, having been abandoned to time for that long.{{Citation needed}} He may see this as a completely uninteresting subject and thus makes fun of Megan with his statements. This would also be more in line with his usual behavior.\n\nIt is also possible that Black Hat is simply mocking conspiracy theorists' obsessions with factually incorrect ideas, comparably to what may be the case in [[Secretary: Part 3]].\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Eye of Providence}}, a symbol of an eye at the top of a pyramid, found on US currency and often associated with conspiracy theories of the {{w|Illuminati}}. Black Hat again refers to the pyramid honey found under the pyramids and calls it a ''conspiracy that goes all the way to the top''. This usually means that the politicians (or the government agencies) ruling the country know about it, but keep it a secret from the public. But in this case, he mixes up terms and says it goes to the top of the pyramid (from the bottom), to where the giant eye is. As promised he also writes four words in all capital letters, shouting out the TRUTH!\n\nThis comic is likely a satire of the stereotypical internet mindset and plays up the frequent confusion between legitimate scientific skepticism, where unsupported claims are rejected, and conspiracy-theory faux-skepticism, where legitimate evidence is rejected because it does not support a specific viewpoint.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: Apparently honey has an infinite shelf life. They just found jars of it in the pyramids, still good.\n:Megan: You know, I've heard that, and I don't think it's true.\n\n:[Black hat enters.]\n:Cueball: Really? Smithsonian magazine confirmed it.\n:Megan: Believe it or not, I think their source is wrong.\n:Black Hat: '''''I believe you.'''''\n\n:[Megan has turned to Black Hat raising her hands.]\n:Megan: See I read about the archaeologists who-\n:Black Hat: I'm convinced. Gonna go to tell the internet.\n\n:[Black Hat moved closer to Megan and Cueball.]\n:Megan: Wait, are you sure? Let me explain why I-\n:Black Hat: Don't need it. I've heard enough.\n\n:[Zoom-in on Black Hat's head.]\n:Black Hat: I've been looking for a weird hill to die on, and all the real ones are too far from my house.\n:Black Hat: So this is mine. I'm now a pyramid honey truther.\n\n:[Zoom back out. Black Hat starts walking left, pointing a finger up. Cueball and Megan turn to look after him.]\n:Black Hat: Time to start a Facebook group and post a bunch of all-caps comments everywhere.\n:Cueball: This could have gone better.\n:Megan: Oh well.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Conspiracy theory]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Science]]"
