Somewhere in the New Mexico desert, the Roadrunner is pursued by a tireless Anton Chigurh.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn this comic [[Randall]] jokes that large areas of the continental (mainland) United States can be characterized by the locations of a single movie. Especially in the Midwest, there are several very large areas that he describes with just one film. The map is the most detailed in the {{w|Northeastern United States|northeast}}, which is where Randall lives.\n\nThe map is divided into the 48 states of the mainland by thin gray lines. On top of these are drawn black lines that divide the map into 50 sections. (A 51st section is located in the Atlantic Ocean.) Inside each section is at least one reference that is supposed to describe the entire area encompassed by the section. In most cases it is the title of a movie (or two to three titles), but it could also be more general specter of movies (all movies with a big budget, or those with whose title is an east coast city name) or it could even be a book/song that describes the relevant area.\n\nThe map's heading describes the idea behind it; if you know this and the relevant movies, you can use it to determine where you are by comparing your knowledge of the movies with the scenery you can see from where you stand. Below the heading, the two groups of people who will get the most use out of this sheet are listed. The first is \"GeoGuessrs\". {{w|GeoGuessr}} is a game using {{w|Google Street View}} images, which drops the player in a random location and challenges them to work out where they are. (It was previously referenced in [[1214: Geoguessr]]). The second group is \"crash-landed astronauts\". Obviously, if you've just crash-landed on Earth, knowing your location would be very helpful. That said, this map only helps if you land in the contiguous United States, which is not very likely overall.\n\nSome entries (for instance, ''{{w|Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day}}'') reflect the locations where the stories are set, and others (like ''{{w|Dances with Wolves}}'') reflect where they were filmed. Others are even more detached, as it is the sceneries from the movie that resembles a given place, even though it is neither filmed there or takes place there. It could also be a cartoon, which is of course only set in an imaginary world that may resemble the real world.\n\nThe title text references {{w|Anton Chigurh}} (portrayed by {{w|Javier Bardem}}), who is the main antagonist of the film ''{{w|No Country For Old Men}}.'' In this case he would have taken over the role of {{w|Wile E. Coyote}}, and would thus hunt down {{w|Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|The Road Runner}} at the boundary between the sections for these two movies, which would be somewhere in the {{w|New Mexico}} desert.\n\n==Table==\n*In this table all the movies (and others) from the map are mentioned.\n**They are listed from top to bottom and (when possible) by going through the columns that seems to appear in the sections when going from left to right.\n**The setting for the movie vs. the actual filming locations will be given to be compared to the section of the map where the titles are written.\n**Explanations will be given in the Notes section.\n**The {{w|List_of_U.S._state_abbreviations#Postal_codes|State Postal Codes}} will often be used here below when referring to a given state.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The eastern halves of Washington and Oregon look nothing like the western halves of those states, as much of these regions are near-desert with no trees.
