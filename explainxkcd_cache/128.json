It is hoped that ''dPain/dt'', or the rate of pain (in this case, shrinking), decreases quickly so that the pain will vanish quickly. He's hoping the value for ''d'' will not be larger than a few days or some weeks. Assuming that ''How much she's still in my life'' is a constant [Megan], [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dP%2Fdt+%3D+%28-k1*P%2BG%29*%281%2F%281%2Bexp%28-%28t-k2%29%2Fd%29%29%29 solving the differential equation] leads to the following solution (with unknown ''c<sub>1</sub>''):\n: <math>  Pain(t) = {c_1 \\left(e^{k_2/d} + e^{t/d}\\right)}^{-dk_1} + \\frac{[\\text{Megan}]}{k_1}</math>\n\nNote: In reality, \"Megan\" is not likely to be a constant.\n\nIf ''k<sub>1</sub>'' was positive or if ''k<sub>2</sub>'' was a large value, the value of ''dPain/dt'' would approach zero. Ideally, ''k<sub>1</sub>'' would be \"How much she's in my life\"/''Pain'' (we assume both these values are positive), while ''k<sub>2</sub>'' would ideally be extremely large. Either of these scenarios approach what would be a situation where the value of ''dPain/dt'' is close to zero. But we don't know the meaning of ''k<sub>1</sub>'' or ''k<sub>2</sub>''; these variables are just unpredictable.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] changes the famous \"laugh to keep from crying\" statement to math.\n\n==Transcript==\n:dPain/dt = (-k<sub>1</sub> Pain + [Image of Megan]) (1/(1 + e ^ -(t-k<sub>2</sub>)/d))\n:''k''<sub>1</sub>=?\n:''k''<sub>2</sub>=?\n:[Image of Megan]=How much she's still in my life\n:Please let ''d'' only be a few days... or weeks\n:I guess there's some kind of a cutoff after years, where it stops mattering and we can be friends. Do I <u>want</u> that?\n:Is ''k''<sub>1</sub> positive? Is ''k''<sub>2</sub> large?\n:Will I ever stop feeling like this?\n\n==Trivia==\n* In ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'', some braille is displayed prominently below the comic:\n<pre>⠊⠞⠀⠞⠁⠨⠑⠎⠀⠍⠕⠗⠑⠀⠞⠊⠍⠑⠀⠞⠓⠁⠝⠀⠽⠕⠥\n⠑⠭⠏⠑⠉⠞⠀⠃⠥⠞⠀⠇⠑⠎⠎⠀⠞⠓⠁⠝⠀⠽⠕⠥⠀⠋⠑⠁⠗⠲</pre>\n*Decoding with a braille translator will give you this message:\n**\"IT TAKES MORE TIME THAN YOU EXPECT BUT LESS THAN YOU FEAR.\"\n***This seems to be a message from Randall about breakups such as this one, assuring readers going through similar situations that it will not last forever.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Analysis]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
