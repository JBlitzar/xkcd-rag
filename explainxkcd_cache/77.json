They appear to walk a great distance, through what appears to be a swamp or perhaps a forest in winter, across a plain, and down to a river valley. Despite traveling so far and through such varied landscapes, in the last panel, the character with hair admits that all he can think about is what a great [[LiveJournal]] post their trip would make. It appears that the plan to get the Internet off their mind has failed.\n\nLiveJournal is a website on which users can make accounts and, effectively, blog, although the site is designed around the premise that the blogs ought to be used as personal journals, with the ability to privatize the journal or only let certain friends see certain entries. LiveJournal was an early social network and an early blog platform and was a good way for people to let others know what was going on in their lives. Randall presented his comics on LiveJournal before using [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com]. Today, LiveJournal still exists, but its popularity has plummeted.\n\nThe title text suggests that [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] has overcome a tendency to think about how he will document what he has been doing, rather than concentrate on the thing itself.\n\nFrom ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'':\n{{quote|This was before Twitter et. al. Now we just post while doing it.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Not-Hairy are talking in a room with a computer on.]\n:Not-Hairy: I feel like I'm wasting my life on the internet.
