Her response begins with a popular reference [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/6.6?lang=eng#p5 from the Bible] concerning {{w|ants}}; however, she specifically narrows in on the sub-family of {{w|fire ants}}.\n\nThe {{w|book of Proverbs}} is a  [https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611_Proverbs-Chapter-1/#3 self-proclaimed book] on receiving wisdom and instruction to be made wise. Thus, her response appears to begin as an instruction to him in response to his question. The proverb in particular she appears to begin quoting instructs the lazy person to \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard! Consider her ways...\" as she prepares for the desolation of winter by providing during the bounty of summer despite not having to be told so. The assumption by the reader would be that she is going to compare Cueball to a lazy person and instruct him to prepare for the later years (winter of life) by studying now while he is young (summer of life).\n\nHowever, after the initial phrase she instead discusses a cool fact about '''fire ants'''. (Specifically the ability of fire ants to join together to form [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2ZysgGAABw floating rafts] in case of flooding). The story could function as a parable on teamwork and collaboration in the face of disaster, but such a metaphor does not apply to the personal life choices Cueball is considering. Cueball silently considers possible interpretations of the fact as a metaphor, then asks her what lesson he is supposed to take away from it. To this she replies with her fascination for ants (''Ants are so cool!'' ). Correctly, Cueball states that she is ''not big on metaphors'', as there were none hidden in her first statement. She continues to tell him what she is big on: '''Ants'''.\n\nThis last exchange may suggest that the expected metaphor would have had as little effect on Cueball's choice to continue grad school as an excited rant about fire ants (since he was just waiting for a metaphor anyway). Alternatively, it expresses that Hairbun finds more instruction in the modern study of the natural world than in classical writings. In either case, it is left ambiguous whether her argument could be helpful at all answer Cueball's dilemma.\n\nBefore reading the title text the reader may have assumed that Cueball went to meet with a University adviser. But the title text instead presents her as an {{w|entomology|entomologist}}, someone who studies insects. In this case, presumably, Cueball's grad studies are in entomology and he is meeting a professor that might act as a career mentor. Thus, her discourse on fire ants may have been to persuade Cueball that his grad studies in entomology were well worth continuing because of the exciting nature of the field of study. This would achieve the intent of the proverb she appeared to quote (convincing Cueball to continue life preparations by finishing grad school) although she discarded its wording.\n\nIn almost an immediate and seemingly bizarre contradiction, she chalks up her strange rambling on fire ants as just a formula that all entomology personnel use when asked any question. They use a two-step formula to answer any questions. It won't help you much because all you will learn is that ants are cool and then they have forgotten anything else you asked them while they continued to think of ants. This would imply that the answer Cueball received had literally nothing to do with his question or situation he was in and any similarity to being a meaningful answer or even a proverb of instruction was purely coincidental and unintended.\n\nAnother popular example where the phrase ''consider the'' from the Bible has been spoofed can be found in {{w|Monty Python's Life of Brian}} ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czBBKof7Yo Consider the lilies]'' sketch. However, this refers to a passage in [https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611_Matthew-Chapter-6/#28 Matthew] instead of [https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611_Proverbs-Chapter-6/#6 Proverbs].\n\nIt seems likely that [[Randall]] is fascinated by ants (he is fascinated by a lot of cool stuffâ€¦)\n*In [[638: The Search]] the SETI project is re-imagined from the perspective of ants, who reach the same conclusion humans often do.\n*According to footnote 2 of the ''[[what if?
