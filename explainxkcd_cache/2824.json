Instead, they emphasize shapes, colors, forms and gestural or non-representational elements in order to convey emotions, concepts or ideas. Abstract art can take various forms, including paintings, sculptures, and other visual media.\n\n{{w|Pickup artist|Pickup artists}} are individuals who engage in strategies and techniques to attract and form romantic or sexual relationships with others, typically focusing on short-term or casual encounters. These strategies often involve tactics for initiating conversations, building rapport and escalating physical intimacy. Pickup artistry is often associated with misogyny, manipulative behavior and a lack of respect for others.\n\nStereotypical pickup artists are misogynistic males who feel disproportionately hard done by and are (over)reacting to the perceived antipathy from \"all women\" and a typical technique that they might use is \"negging\", or making a comment which is intended to lower their target's self-esteem under the guise of being perfectly normal (and even complimentary) small-talk. Randall has previously indicated his disdain for pickup artists in [[1027: Pickup Artist]] and [[1178: Pickup Artists]].\n\nThe word \"artist\" has different meanings in these two phrases. In the first one, it means someone who makes paintings as a profession or hobby, and \"abstract\" narrows down the types of paintings. In the second, it means a practitioner of some activity, and \"pickup\" is the (reprehensible{{cn}}) specific activity. The joke is in conflating the two senses when saying that the two groups have merged.\n\nWhite Hat is a representative of this combined group and in his usual fashion seems to have mixed the two in a peculiar manner, calling a bunch of cubes \"cute\". He's talking to a group of cubes he has just painted, which he describes as a melange (being an artistic term for a disordered mixture), in his role as an abstract artist. But by the end of his comment he has passed through a disarming compliment (that they are \"actually pretty cute\", seemingly saying that few other people will ever think the same), revealing his pickup artist tendencies by seemingly dismissing them as a \"dizzying swarm\" which few would call \"cute\" (showing White Hat's signature peculiarity as no one will call a melange of cubes cute).{{cn}}\n\nIn the title text, it appears that a third type of artist (the {{w|Escapology|escape artist}}, again very different from both of the other types of artist) has fulfilled their own \"role\" by escaping from conversation with a pickup artist. Assuming that the escape artist is a woman, this might be an additional joke that pickup artists are not good at \"picking up\" women and instead just act like \"a bunch of chains\" to escape from.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat holding a paintbrush in his left arm standing next to an easel.
