There's a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is a continuation of the previous comic in \"[[The Race]]\" series, [[580: The Race: Part 4]]. In panel 6 (2nd panel in the 2nd row), [[Nathan Fillion]] line is reminiscent of a similar quote from the 2nd episode of {{w|Firefly (TV series)|''Firefly''}}, {{w|The Train Job}}: \"I just wanted you to face me so she could get behind ya.\" In the show, {{w|Malcolm Reynolds}} is aided by {{w|Zoë Washburne}}, his second in command, who gets behind the bar thug he is speaking to. In the comic, Nathan Fillion is using the line on a fan, but {{w|Gina Torres}} is not standing behind [[Cueball]] this time.\n\n[[Summer Glau]]'s line about growing but not retracting her hair appears to mean that because Nathan used her to stop Cueball, she has to stop him as well, which she neatly does. Alternatively, the line may be a random non-sequitur of the sort often uttered by her neurologically damaged character in the Firefly 'verse. \"Bwah!\" is a sound Malcolm makes during one episode in which one of his crewmembers inadvertently sneaks up on him while trying to ask him a question. When he is questioned about it, he says he has invented a new war cry, and promptly practices yelling 'Bwahhhh' in a confident manner while readying his pistol.\n\nSummer's statement in the 10th panel about swallowing a bug is a reference to the movie {{w|Serenity (film)|''Serenity''}}, made in 2005 to conclude Firefly's storyline. After a harrowing high-speed chase in an open-topped hovercraft, the only comment from Summer's character is \"I swallowed a bug,\" showing that she was either unconcerned, or stunned, by the narrow escape. The final panel is a reference to {{w|Fox Television}}'s treatment of ''Firefly''. ''Firefly'' was cancelled after only 11 episodes of the 14 made were aired, leaving three episodes unaired. Internet petitions, contrary to the sarcastic suggestion in the final panel, pretty much never work.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\nElectric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like [[139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards]], [[409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic)]] and a panel in [[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel]]. Notably, Summer appears not to ''need'' the electronic controller to ride the board. Either she is being assisted remotely (as Nathan ''thought'' he would be, in the previous comic) or her character-linked strange nature is involved. This could possibly involve a purely psychic link, but with the evidence of being able pull Nathan from the board seemingly without effort (or accounting for his inertia) it may suggest she is something more akin to her biomechanical Terminator-series machine character.\n\nIn the title text, it is revealed that Fillion is 'actually naked' under his coat. This isn't very surprising in the xkcd universe, as stick figures are always 'naked' by normal definition. However, this is apparently the actual reason why Fox cancelled their final panel. Therefore, there have been two petitions - one to show the final battle, and another to get Fillion to remove the coat.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. These are all the comics in [[:Category:The Race|The Race series]]:\n* [[577: The Race: Part 1]]\n* [[578: The Race: Part 2]]\n* [[579: The Race: Part 3]]\n* [[580: The Race: Part 4]]\n* [[581: The Race: Part 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Nathan skates in.]\n:Nathan: So you took care of him?\n:Summer: I can extrude hair, but I  can't retract it.\n:Nathan: That a yes?\n:[Summer grabs Nathan's arm as he skates past her, pulling him off the board.]\n:Nathan: Bwah!\n:[An Andy Capp-esque meleè dust cloud.]\n:WHAP BAM POW WHAM\n:[Summer skates away.]\n:[A beat-up Nathan approaches an similarly battered Cueball.]\n:Nathan: She may have my board, but I can still beat you to the finish line if I bring you down.\n:Cueball: Bring it, Captain Tightpants.\n:Nathan: I've got nothing to  bring.
