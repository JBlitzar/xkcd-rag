Before he could stop the child from reading, the child had already made it clear that he had seen {{w|Hardcore pornography|hard-core pornography}} in the {{w|Pop-up ad|pop-up ads}} he had encountered. He is familiar with the sight of women being \"double penetrated\" (i.e. engaged in simultaneous vaginal and anal sex) and that said women are completely naked (implied by his surprise to see similar-looking women wearing swimsuits in the magazine). Thus, the swimsuit issue, in which the women are wearing ''some'' clothing and are not engaged in sexual activity, is relatively tame.\n\nThe title text has [[Randall]] suggest that {{w|Ad blocking|pop-up blockers}} are far more important than {{w|The birds and the bees}}, a stance that most people do not agree with.{{Citation needed}} There is some sense towards this approach, however. While \"the birds and the bees\" conversation would have to wait until the child has matured enough to understand, the removal of explicit pop-ups (and other advertisements) is arguably more urgent. Pop-up blockers alone would not prevent '''everything''', but are a valuable asset nonetheless.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A cueball-child, standing and perusing an apparent magazine that they are holding.
