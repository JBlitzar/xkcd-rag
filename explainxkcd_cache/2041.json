It seems to imply that other fields of research aren’t a challenge anymore.\n\nOuter '''space''' is so vast in size that it’s impossible for humans to discover even just the stars in our galaxy within a lifetime, as astronomers estimate that there are 100 to 400 billion stars in the {{w|Milky Way}}. Space travel is also very difficult and expensive.\n\n'''The oceans''' are very deep. The vast majority of the deeper oceans hasn’t been visited by humans, and there is still much we don’t know about the living beings in the deep sea. Around 95% of the oceans haven't been explored and mapped by humans.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\n'''The human mind''' is not only very complex, but also often seems irrational, which makes it harder to investigate. Its relation to the brain is also somewhat mysterious: {{w|philosophy of mind}} is split on whether the mind is ultimately material (materialism) or immaterial (dualism/idealism). Further, certain philosophical systems have trouble explaining its relation to the body, in what is termed the {{w|mind–body problem}}.\n\n'''Alaska''' is the state of largest area in the U.S., and also the most sparsely populated. Many places in Alaska have only been partially explored to this day. Randall was probably inspired by the TV series ''{{w|Alaska: The Last Frontier}}'', which plays off of the state’s official nickname of “The Last Frontier”.\n\nThe humor from this comic comes from the fact that Alaska seems comparably of less important than the other “Final Frontiers”. It is not as hard or expensive to explore as the ocean bottom and outer space, and it is much smaller. While one's own human mind is much more easily accessible than the other three locations, its nature is a substantial frontier in human knowledge. Furthermore, minds other than one’s own are very hard to access.\n\nThe title text refers to the movie ''{{w|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier}}'', released in 1989. “Final frontier” is a recurring motif in the ''Star Trek'' franchise (coming from the opening narration for ''{{w|Star Trek: The Original Series}}''), and is used to describe the exploration of outer space, which remains a notable frontier to humans, both in real life and within ''Star Trek''. [[Randall]], however, jokingly posits that the frontier to be explored is the film itself, and assumes that, because this movie has been out for a while—nearly thirty years—it ought to be fully and comprehensively explored by now.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In a single framed picture a hand drawn rhomboid is shown.
