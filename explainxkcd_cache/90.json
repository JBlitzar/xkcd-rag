However, the friend (likely intentionally in response to the unnecessary swearing) takes ''fucking'' to be an identifier of which jacket is being discussed, and gives a smart-aleck response implying that Cueball wears the jacket while having sex. His counterpart gets confused by the sarcasm, and the topic is dismissed.\n\nThe title text states that this often occurs in Cueball/Randall's apartment.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two men stand and talk to one another.]\n:Cueball: Where's my fucking jacket?\n:[Friend indicates something behind him.]\n:Friend: Over there, next to your regular one.\n:Cueball: My what?\n:Friend: Never mind.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic is the second comic to use an all-caps lettering, the first being [[78: Garfield]], where the all-caps lettering may have been based off of the lettering in the actual comic strip.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
