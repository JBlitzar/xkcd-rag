I mean, with a little remixing, some of this could be kinda good!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] wants to take [[Megan]] out for his idea of a cultural experience; a {{w|symphony}}. The inference is that Megan's culturally impoverished because \"all she ever listens to is {{w|techno}}\". After much griping on various levels, for instance complaining that all the other attendees are above sixty years old, she starts to get into the experience â€” sort of. The big 'cultural lesson' she (mis)gleans from the experience is similar to what a sporting aficionado would gain from watching a sports event. So it could be said that Cueball's ''mission to culture'' was a mission impossible in Megan's case.\n\nHer observation regards the seating configuration of a typical modern {{w|orchestra}}, in which the {{w|Violin|violinists}} all sit audience-left, while the {{w|Viola|violists}}, {{w|Cello|cellists}} and {{w|bassists}}, with clearly larger instruments, are on the right. But it is not the size of an instrument that determines the payroll of a musician.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text is just icing on the cake. A {{w|sampler (musical instrument)|sampler}} is an instrument frequently used in techno music that samples other sounds and plays them back, usually electronically altered. {{w|Remix|Remixing}} is a process, also often used in techno, of editing recorded music to get a different sound. Many classical pieces have had success as techno remixes. One example is Pachelbel's Canon in D major, referred to in the title text of [[339: Classic]].\n\nTechno music is the subject of [[411: Techno]] and is also referenced in [[740: The Tell-Tale Beat]].\n\nThree of the old people in the line look very similar to the old people in [[572: Together]]. In the very next comic [[587: Crime Scene]] a man is again shown with hair only around the side of his head.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is pulling Megan by her feet. She is holding onto the carpet, which visibly folds under her tug.]\n:Cueball: We're getting some culture in you if it ''kills'' you.\n:Megan: Don't wanna.\n\n:[Cueball is pushing Megan at the front door, with steps leading down outside. Megan is curled up with both her feet and her hands up on the middle of the door, her back arching out towards Cueball.]\n:Cueball: All you listen to is techno.\n:Megan: But... the ''symphony?''\n\n:[Cueball and Megan stand in line between two other couples; A guy, who only has hair around his neck and a cane, and Hairbun stands behind them. A guy with a sailor cap and a woman with a big hair stands before them.]\n:Megan: I think we're the only people here under 60.\n:Cueball: Shhh.\n\n:[The couple sit in the audience just before the concert.]\n:Megan: The right side is definitely better.\n:Cueball: Better? \n:Megan: They've all got bigger instruments. I bet they make more money.\n:Cueball: *Sigh*\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
