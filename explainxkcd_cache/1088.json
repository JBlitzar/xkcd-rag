'Oh, sorry! I'm no longer interested. There's a bunch of future I gotta go check out!'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is a take on the common and cliched job interview question here asked by [[Hairbun]]: ''Where do you see yourself in 5 years?'' The interviewer is attempting to see where the job seeker would like to take their career and also what their hopes and dreams are etc.\n\nIn the comic, instead of explaining where he would like to be in 5 years, [[Beret Guy]] and the interviewer wait around for 5 years without moving to find out. And as Beret Guy expected they stayed exactly where they were. (This could be suggesting that most people do not change much over five years.)\n\nThe title text is a continuation of their conversation in which Beret Guy turns down the job because he wants to find out what happened in the last 5 years while they were both sitting in that room.\n\nGiven Beret Guy's ability to manipulate reality ([[1099: Tuesdays]]), it's possible he froze himself and the interviewer for 5 years or sped up time to ensure that 5 years would pass quickly enough that the interviewer could not react and affect the experiment.\n\nThis is similar to [[943: Empirical]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairbun and Beret Guy sit across from each other at a desk.]\n:Hairbun : Where do you see yourself in five years? \n:Beret Guy: Oh man, I don't know! Let's find out!\n:[Beat panel.]\n:[Another beat panel, this time showing the effects of waiting five years in the same spot: cobwebs and hair grow, and the desk and chairs fall into disrepair.]\n:Beret Guy: Hahâ€”\n:Beret Guy: I ''thought'' so!\n\n{{Comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Job interviews]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]"
