Even if a man page existed, it is unreasonable to require the user of a toaster to read the manual simply to avoid being stabbed in the face. Toasters toast bread, and in virtually every 'normal' scenario, someone using a toaster would insert bread into the toaster, wait for the bread to be toasted, then take the toast from the toaster. People who use toasters would never expect their toaster to stab them in the face, because every other toaster doesn't do that, and it is unreasonable for consumer products to attempt to kill the user.{{citation needed}} Despite all this, the 911 dispatcher decides that, as Cueball has not read the man page, he is not entitled to medical assistance, and so hangs up.\n\nAs such, the comic is satirizing people who respond to requests for advice for unclear, complicated tools with references to esoteric documentation rather than any help. \n\nThe title text refers to the popular phrase \"Life's too short,\" which asserts that because we only have a limited amount of time on Earth, and that time can pass by quickly, we should make the most of it. That could mean, for example, don't spend time reading the documentation unless you actually experience a problem. The second part suggests that some people actually die because they didn't RTFM!\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball with a knife sticking out of his heavily bleeding face stands in front of a toaster on a counter, which has an arm extending from the top of it. He is holding a telephone to his ear.]\n:Cueball: Hello, 911? I just tried to toast some bread, and the toaster grew an arm and stabbed me in the face!\n:911: Did you read the toaster's man page first?\n:Cueball: Well, no, but all I wanted was--\n:911: ''click''\n\n{{comic discussion}} \n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Man pages]]"
