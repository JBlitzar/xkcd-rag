I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic shows a box of \"Deep-cleaning pore strips,\" which are a skin-care product designed to clean your pores. You stick them on your face, wait a while, and then rip them off. When they come off, a whole lot of disgusting gunk, like dirt and body oils, is allegedly lifted out of your pores with them. The kind shown in the comic, however, is \"deep cleaning\", and rips out not only the user's pore gunk, but also his entire skull. However, the skull looks extremely clean, so the cleaning has probably worked.\n\nThe title text indicates that while Randall is aware that pore-cleaning strips are useless and possibly harmful products created to make money by \"solving\" something that isn't actually a problem, they seem quite effective at getting things out of the pores on a person's nose. In reality, pore strips only remove excess material (dead skin, oil, dirt, etc) from the surface of the skin, and do not effectively clean one's pores. Randall appears to be unaware of this fact, though this dishonesty on the part of the manufacturer may tie in to the potentially malicious nature of the 'cosmetics-industrial complex' (see below).\n\nThe title text refers to the cosmetics industry as the \"cosmetics-industrial complex\", which is a play on the term \"{{w|military-industrial complex}}\", coined by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th president of the United States.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A box of pore strips, marked \"deep cleaning.\"]\n\n:[Cueball examines the box.]\n\n:[Cueball applies strip to face.]\n\n:[Cueball pulls on strip.]\n\n:[Cueball pulls skull out of head with pore strip.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
