As a result, the end of the call devolves into a cycle where each one teasingly insists that the other one hang up first.  It's a sweet, if somewhat mawkish display of how infatuated they are with each other. \n\nAs xkcd often does, this comic takes the cliche to its logical extreme with [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]], by turning it into an argument resulting in their breakup. What's normally a cutesy game between lovers becomes a battle of wills, leading them to break up because neither is willing to back down.  And then, even after they break up, both are still unwilling to back down, with Megan insisting that Cueball \"move on and find somebody else first.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting on a bed, on the phone.]\n:Cueball: You hang up first.\n\n:[Megan is lying on a different bed elsewhere, on the phone.]\n:Megan: No, ''you'' hang up first.\n\n:Cueball: No, ''you'' hang up first.\n\n:Megan: No, ''you'' fucking hang up first!\n\n:Cueball: You hang up first, or we're ''OVER!''\n\n:Megan: Then I guess we're fucking ''OVER!''\n\n:Cueball: FINE!\n\n:Megan: ...\n\n:Cueball: ...\n\n:Megan: ''You'' move on and find somebody else first.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Phones]]"
