This reflects a common scientific pursuit, {{w|reductionism}}, to uncover the basic principles underlying all physical phenomena in order to understand them. For example, most chemical reactions can be explained as the recombinations of a few dozen common elements. \n\nThe comic then splits into two branches representing different fields of physics which refute Cueball's optimistic assumption: {{w|condensed matter physics}} and {{w|quantum field theory}}.\n\nOn the left, the concept of {{w|antireductionism}} (or {{w|holism}}) is demonstrated by the Condensed Matter Physics branch. Cueball encounters a cloud of vibrating particles, which symbolizes the complexity that arises when simple particles combine to produce complex behaviors. The issue with reducing down to particles is that the number of different interactions between particles to understand makes the topic no longer simple. This highlights the challenge of predicting macroscopic properties from microscopic interactions, a central theme in condensed matter physics. This is shown in everyday life, from things like a baseball curving through the air, to how a mirror reflects light. [[1734: Reductionism]] also touches on the impracticality of gaining knowledge about a larger construct through understanding its constituent parts.\n\nOn the right, in the Quantum Field Theory branch, Cueball is faced with the issue that particles at the quantum level aren't simple. Quantum Field Theory deals with the fundamental particles and forces of nature, and it describes a complex world where particles can behave as both waves and particles simultaneously, among other strange phenomena. \n\nThe title text introduces a third branch: the field of {{w|cosmology}}, which deals with the large-scale structure and history of the universe. Cosmology suggests that even our catalog of the most fundamental particles might be inadequate - perhaps an allusion to theorized phenomena like dark matter and dark energy - raising questions about the nature of existence itself.\n\nNo matter how you study the universe, it's complicated.{{cn}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball gestures at a particle, represented as a dot with motion lines around it.]\n:Cueball: Everything is made of tiny particles.
