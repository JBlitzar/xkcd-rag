If you really want to mess with people, try using Splinter of the Mind's Eye.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nEach <span style=\"border-bottom:1px dotted\" title=\"thus excluding spin-offs like Rogue One\">episodic</span> ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' film begins with an \"{{tvtropes|OpeningScroll|opening crawl}}\" giving the audience some of the backstory, which often reads like the prologue of a novel.  \n\n[[Randall]] wants to reverse this by projecting the text of a Star Wars novel and see how long this can be continued before viewers realize it is a prank. The text in the opening scroll is actually from the beginning of the {{w|Thrawn_trilogy#The_Last_Command|final book of the Thrawn Trilogy}} by Timothy Zahn.\n\nThe title text compares different Star Wars novels' style, remarking on how well suited they would be for this prank.\n\n{{w|Timothy Zahn}} is a science fiction writer who has written and contributed to [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timothy_Zahn#Works many novels and comics] in the {{w|Star Wars expanded universe}}. The [https://www.google.de/books/edition/Star_Wars_The_Last_Command/JbPaDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT8&printsec=frontcover text in the comic] is the first five paragraphs from the book ''[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Command The Last Command]''. The characters mentioned are [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mitth%27raw%27nuruodo Grand Admiral Thrawn], the primary antagonist of the ''Thrawn Trilogy'', and [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pellaeon Gilad Pellaeon], who serves as a {{w|Dr. Watson}}-type companion to Thrawn throughout much of the trilogy.\n\n''[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Splinter_of_the_Mind%27s_Eye Splinter of the Mind's Eye]'' was an early Star Wars novel written before the original film was expanded to a trilogy (and then expanded some more), so it contains multiple aborted subplots which can make it very confusing for a fan who has seen the later works.\n\nThe term \"EU\" refers to \"Expanded Universe\", which was the term for the corpus of non-cinematic ''Star Wars'' content before ''Star Wars'' was acquired by {{w|Disney}}. Not wanting to be constrained by previous canon, Disney declared all \"Expanded Universe\" content to be non-canonical to all future movies, and re-branded the EU as \"Legends\" to take place in its own alternate continuity.\n\nFor a very long time, fans believed that the Thrawn Trilogy would have constituted Star Wars VII to IX should the movie have been made and thus \"before they figure out there's no movie coming after it\" refers to both the mistaken belief of fans and the novelization as delivered through the opening crawl.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[On a black background with many stars is five blocks of yellow text that recedes towards a black section at the back of the panel. The last block cannot be read, but it is (almost) possible to read the second block of text at the back.
