On the other hand, that's the mother of all sampling biases.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic relates to the anxiety of having a first child, particularly an unplanned child, and is a play on the double meaning of the expression \"do what comes naturally\". \n\nDoing what comes naturally is a euphemism for couples pairing off and forming intimate relationships, including sex. It is also advice given to new parents, advising them not to second guess themselves so much, to alleviate the stress that comes with parenting.\n\nThe couple [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] find themselves as unexpected parents. Both parents experience anxiety over how to manage their life with the child. The new father defuses the situation and states that parenting can not be that hard and they should just do what comes naturally. Naturally the couple find themselves with a second child. This adds insult to injury as now they have two children and still no idea about how to parent. As the first child was an \"accident\" the birth of the child was because of instinctual urges. Therefore, assuming nothing has changed in their relationship it would be natural if they produced another child.\n\nThe baby says, \"Baby!\", either copying Cueball, or saying its name Pok√©mon-style.\n\nThe title text claims that parenting can't be too hard because, up to the present, all of your ancestors have produced an unbroken line of children who figured out how to raise at least one child that is able to continue this unbroken chain. [[Randall]] jokes that this is the \"mother\" of all {{w|sampling bias}}es: Had anyone of one's ancestors completely failed at being parents, that person would never exist. Therefore, this sampling is heavily skewed by sampling only those that were all successful in at least one instance. It does not take into account the number of people in the past who do not have any lineage today to speak of, or the number times our ancestors failed at being parents to children we are not directly descended from. Because a mother is a type of parent, the expression \"''mother'' of all sampling biases\" is also somewhat literal in this case because successful motherhood is part of what is being sampled.\n\n[[441: Babies]] and [[1384: Krypton]] also depict Cueball and Megan as people who should not be trusted with babies.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are looking down at a baby, throwing its arms in the air, standing between them.]\n:Cueball: Oh man, we made a baby.\n:Megan: ''Don't panic. Don't panic.''\n:Baby: Baby!\n\n:[Cueball looks at Megan, who still look down at the baby, which now looks down at her feet.]\n:Cueball: Parenting can't be that hard. Let's just do what comes naturally.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel they all three just stand there, they look down and the baby has spread it's arms out. Beat frame.]\n\n:[A caption is in a frame at the top of the panel. Cueball and Megan are looking down between them. There are now two babies, one larger looking at Cueball's feet the smaller looking at Megan's feet.]\n:Soon:\n:Megan: Aw, crap.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with babies]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
