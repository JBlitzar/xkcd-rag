It responded to voice commands starting with [https://support.google.com/glass/answer/3079305 \"OK ''glass''\"], for example to initiate video recording or to check tomorrow's weather. Strangers and other people surrounding the user would often find it annoying to hear someone talking to \"himself\", or to ''Glass''. Also many people who bought the newest gadgets, like Google Glass was, like to brag about it, and thus would try to say ''OK Glass'' so loud that other people will notice they have these cool new glasses. This was very annoying in general!\n\nRandall's hobby is saying \"OK, ''glass''\" before any sentence while he is only wearing regular glasses. Like here where he (drawn as usual like [[Cueball]], with regular glasses) is checking tomorrow's weather, not on the glasses but on his {{w|smartphone}}. Apparently this is even more annoying to the bystander than if he would actually have worn a real ''Google Glass'' while saying so. He thus both annoys other people, mocks people who buy such glasses to brag about them, and in general mocks Google Glass.\n\nThe \"OK, ''Glass''\" keyword is not useless outside of ''Glass''; in the browser Chrome and the Android/iOS app ''Google Now'', \"OK, ''Glass''\" is also valid instead of \"OK, ''Google''\" to initiate a voice command. While Cueball may be using this app, it is not necessarily the case, given that the caption states that Cueball enjoys prefacing everything with the phrase. It seems generally that Randall was no fan of Google Glass, which was also shown earlier in [[1251: Anti-Glass]]. Google Glass was a [[:Category:Google Glass|recurring theme]] in xkcd in 2013.\n\nIn the title text, Randall states that there is an extra benefit by doing this while only wearing regular glasses. Because when someone is finally fed up with the annoyance and rips the glasses off and stomps on them, then it would cost much less for regular glasses than if he had to replace a \"Google Glass\". These were very expensive - $1,500 at the time of this comic, as the title text says. (Note that regular glasses can also be very expensive, but you could choose to wear your reserve glasses for such a prank...). Also [https://mashable.com/2014/02/26/google-glass-assault/ several people] have claimed to been attacked while wearing Google Glass in San Francisco, with one person claiming [https://mashable.com/2014/04/13/google-glass-wearer-attacked/ their attacker destroyed their Glass].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:My Hobby:\n\n:[Cueball, wearing regular glasses, is holding his smartphone up in one hand while typing, as shown with two times two small movement lines on either side of the phone. A voice from off-panel right emanates from a starburst at the frame.]\n:Cueball: OK, Glass, check tomorrow's weather.\n:Cueball: Ooh, snow!\n:Off-panel voice: Oh my god, it's somehow even ''more'' annoying than if you had it.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Saying \"OK, Glass\" before everything while wearing regular glasses.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Smartphones]]\n[[Category:Google Glass]]\n[[Category:Weather]]"
