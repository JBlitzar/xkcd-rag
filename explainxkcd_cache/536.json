Clarke}} was a science fiction writer and a futurist. The quoted remark provides a benchmark for how long it will take to create something as massive and advanced as a {{w|space elevator}}: when technology reaches the point where the idea is considered seriously rather than dismissed out of hand, about fifty years of further effort will make it a reality.\n\n''{{w|Mind of Mencia}}'' was an American television comedy series running from 2005 to 2008. [[Cueball]] implies that the show is so unfunny that putting it on every channel would {{tvtropes|DudeNotFunny|destroy everyone's sense of humor}}, thus preventing them from laughing at anything, space elevators included.\n\nThe ''{{w|space fountain}}'', mentioned in the title text, is another proposed method of overcoming the planet's gravitational barrier, involving an effect similar to that of a {{w|coil gun}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan sit beside a moonlit lake.]\n:Cueball: Arthur C. Clarke said space elevators will be built 50 years after everybody stops laughing.\n\n:[Closeup of Cueball.]\n:Cueball: So all we have to do is get ''Mind of Mencia'' on every channel and wait.\n:Megan (offscreen): Oh, hush.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Elevators]]"
