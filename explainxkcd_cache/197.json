The four turtles are named for four artists of the European Renaissance: {{w|Leonardo da Vinci}}, {{w|Michelangelo|Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni}}, {{w|Donatello|Donato di Niccol√≤ di Betto Bardi}}, and {{w|Raphael|Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino}}. Due to the popularity of the Ninja Turtles in a variety of media, some of the names are now better known through their Ninja Turtle connection than their original artist forebears. The pie charts provide an approximation of this effect - Leonardo da Vinci remains one of the most notable artists of the period, and thus \"Leonardo\" is depicted as more notable for the artist. Donatello is the most obscure of the four as an artist, and consequently the majority of the current notoriety of \"Donatello\" is as a Ninja Turtle.\n\nThe colors used in the comic correspond to the primary colors of the turtles (green for the body, brown for the shell), especially in the original series from the 80s.\n\nThe title text alludes to a similar phenomenon, as two villain characters from the same Ninja Turtles show called {{w|Bebop and Rocksteady|\"Bebop\" and \"Rocksteady\"}} are now better known as the characters than for the musical genres they are named for. Similarly, the {{w|William Tell Overture}} became so closely tied to the character of the Lone Ranger in media for the previous generation that, to many, the William Tell Overture is in effect \"The Lone Ranger Theme.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four pie graphs, each colored green and brown.]\n:Leonardo\n:[Almost one-half green.]\n:Michelangelo\n:[More than one-half green.]\n:Donatello\n:[Five-sixths green.]\n:Raphael\n:[Roughly half-and-half.]\n:[A legend]\n:Notoriety as a\n:[Brown.] Renaissance artist\n:[Green.] Ninja turtle\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Pie charts]]"
