Specifically, it is assumed that objects are moving in a {{w|vacuum}} and that there is no {{w|friction}}. Then the complicated effects of air resistance and surface frictions can be ignored, and the more basic principles of momentum and energy can be explored. In more advanced physics, it is often easier or necessary to ignore friction if the process being studied is very complicated. So it could be said that \"physics professors like working in a frictionless vacuum\" (with vacuums already being technically frictionless, it is implicit that this term refers to all ''surfaces'' found within that vacuum).\n\nIn the comic, [[Black Hat]] and [[Danish]] have interpreted that statement to mean that physics professors like doing their work while they are in a frictionless vacuum, instead of liking to work with problems which are set in a frictionless vacuum. Apparently, they have drugged a physics professor and put him in a glass dome (with his laptop so he can work) which they can evacuate, with the floor frictionless. The professor wakes up confused from the drugs, and as the air is pumped out to make a vacuum (presumably slowly enough to prevent {{w|explosive decompression}} from coming into play), his words fade to silence because sound waves requires a substance such as air to travel through. As he starts to panic, he tries to run, presumably for the door we see in the last panels. However, without friction on the floor, he cannot exert any force to move forward, and his feet skate uselessly on the ground until he loses balance and falls. At this point he is probably suffering from {{w|asphyxiation}}. Black Hat and Danish are observing from outside the dome, and decide that physics professors have lied about liking to work in frictionless vacuums, even though they almost certainly knew that the physicist would die, {{Citation needed}} showcasing Black Hat's tendency to be a [[Classhole]].\n\nThe title text refers to another common idealization, of an infinite {{w|plane}} of uniform {{w|density}}. An infinite plane extends forever in two dimensions, which makes calculations easier because surface-related properties are identical everywhere. \"Uniform density\" could refer to the mass density of the plane, or more likely an {{w|electric charge}} density, which makes a common problem in basic {{w|electromagnetism}} involving calculating the {{w|electric field}}. The \"other two physicists\" that Black Hat and Danish are experimenting on are lost on the infinite plane, since there are no edges or landmarks anywhere to give them direction.\n\nIt should be noted that, although a vacuum can be approximated using a {{w|vacuum pump}}, {{w|frictionless plane|frictionless surfaces}} and infinite planes are only imaginary constructs and do not exist in our universe.{{Citation needed}}{{Actual citation needed|reason=A source for this could be interesting to read}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Darkness.]\n\n:[Cueball is standing next to a laptop, looking groggy.]\n:Cueball: Ugh...\n:Cueball: What happened?\n\n:[Cueball begins to regain some awareness, with his speech eventually fading out.]\n:Cueball: Where am I?\n:''FWOOOOOOSH''\n:Cueball: Help!
