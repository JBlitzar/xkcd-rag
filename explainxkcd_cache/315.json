Where the regular text reads 'press red button', the braille reads 'press two-inch button'.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Braille}} is a writing system for the blind and {{w|Visual impairment|visually impaired}} using bumps on a paper, slate, etc. However, since most sighted people have no need for braille, and because braille messages may need to convey purely-visual information to blind people, the braille message may be adjusted from the original message. In this case, however, it acts as a jab toward people who are not blind, saying that \"sighted people suck,\" which is obviously not something you would typically see ([[559: No Pun Intended|no pun intended]]) on informational signs.<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[285:_Wikipedian_Protester|''SIGHTation needed'']]<nowiki>]</nowiki></sup> Similar \"translations\" can be found when one deciphers the alien translations on nearly all signs in the TV show {{w|Futurama}}.\n\nThe title text shows a practical (and more realistic) example of where regular text and braille text may differ. As the visually impaired cannot see color,<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[285:_Wikipedian_Protester|''SIGHTation needed'']]<nowiki>]</nowiki></sup> the label would need to identify some other defining feature of the button in question, such as the given measurement.\n\n==Transcript==\n:I learned to read braille a while back, and I've noticed that the messages on signs don't always match the regular text.\n:[A sign reads \"Third Floor Office\" with braille print underneath. Cueball is reading the braille.]\n:Cueball (thinking): s-i-g-h-t-e-d-p-e-o-p-l-e-s-u-c-k ... Hey! \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
