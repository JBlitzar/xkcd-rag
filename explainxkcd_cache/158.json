In the moment after waking up, he is sometimes unable to tell reality and dream apart. However, the third panel reveals the punchline: His confusion results from the likeness between his ex and her mother, next to whom he apparently wakes up every morning. It becomes clear that he has left the girl six months ago in order to live with her mother instead. The comic lampshades at the state of emotional confusion after a break-up that is prominently featured in many films and books.\n\nThe title text furthers the joke, saying the confusion of why he left her is gone once the older woman does \"that thing with her tongue,\" possibly referring to fellatio.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing.]\n:Cueball: It's been six months and I still have those dreams where you're pressed tight against me, where you look into my eyes and give me that grin and it's like you've forgotten everything.\n\n:Cueball: And something in the back of my head says it's wrong, it's not like this anymore, but I push it down.  In the morning, I tell myself I can't control my dreams, but there's a part of me that doesn't want them to stop.\n\n:Cueball: And honestly, waking up would be a lot easier if your mom didn't look so much like you.\n:Cueball: There's always that moment of confusion.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]"
