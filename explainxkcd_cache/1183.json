In such movies, one often used romantic gesture is {{tvtropes|FlowersOfRomance|spreading rose petals in the house or apartment}}, making a way towards the bedroom in which a romantic interest/lover is waiting surrounded by roses for a love-making session. The joke is that these petals don't lead from the front door to the bedroom and [[Cueball]]'s lover, but in the opposite direction instead from the bedroom out onto the street. It appears that someone has set up a box of rose petals and an electric fan atop a {{w|Roomba}} (an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner) as a method of automatically creating such a trail. The title text suggests that despite the other party's intentions of setting this up as a joke to trick Cueball, Cueball ended up having a lovely time with the Roomba.\n\n==Transcript== \n:[Cueball enters a room from a door on the left side of the room, to see a line of red rose petals on the floor leading outside the panel and further into the room.]\n:[Cueball follows the line of rose petals in the space between two panels.]\n:[Cueball continues following the line of rose petals and observes that the trail, snaking around a stack of two books; leads out the front door, down the driveway, and along the sidewalk.]\n:[The rose petals lead up to a table fan behind what appears to be a box, presumably filled with rose petals with a small opening in the back. Both are sitting on a Roomba which is mooring down the sidewalk. The fan is on, and is blowing the rose petals out the slit in the back of the box. The contraption, which has the words ROOMBA emblazoned upon the Roomba part of the machine, whirs as it moves along the pavement.]\n:Whirrrrrr\n:Roomba\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Roomba]]"
