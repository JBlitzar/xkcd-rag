While many are simply tunes that personalize a user's phone, some will use ringtones that resemble everyday sounds, such as doorbells, coughing, alarm noises, or in this case, the buzzing of a mosquito. Although rather innocuous, these ringtones can get very annoying to some people, which is what this comic is getting at.\n\nHere, [[Black Hat]] has set his ringtone to \"The sound a mosquito makes as it buzzes past your ear\", the winner of the \"Awful Ringtone Championship\". [[Cueball]], hearing the sound, cries out and swats the air around his head, mistaking the ringtone for an actual mosquito buzzing past his ear. In addition to being an extremely unpleasant sound, it could also cause confusion to others, as shown in the comic, thus being unanimously decided as the most annoying ringtone. [[Black Hat]]'s response is likely a pun meaning both \"Oh, I've got to take this [call]\" (like someone who has been interrupted by a phone call) and need to leave and respond and \"Oh, I've got to take this [competition]\" since the ringtone is so annoying.\n\nThe title text refers to four other annoying ringtones, apparently none of which were deemed as annoying as a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMg-IgW7Dzg mosquito buzzing]:\n*\"Clock radio alarm\". [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eaym36MR1A These] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F30q6fMGV3s sounds] are often loud and annoying, just to ensure that you really will wake up.\n*\"B-flat at 194 decibels\". {{w|Bâ™­ (musical note)|B-flat}} is a musical note with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4LaqyxPwSE pitch] of 466.16&nbsp;Hz (or any power of 2 or 1/2 multiplied by that). 194&nbsp;decibels is 501187233627% (most devices only go up to 100%/0dB) and is the {{w|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure and sound pressure levels|limit at 1 atmosphere pressure}}. Any more energy would create a shockwave. This could also be a reference to a crowd of {{w|vuvuzela}}s as they also produce sounds pitched around B flat. This may also refer to several B-flat-related phenomena discussed in an NPR story, [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7442915 Have You Heard About B Flat?] Specifically, B-flat has been found to agitate alligators, and waves passing through gas near a black hole have been found to resonate at a frequency which results in a B flat 57 octaves below middle C. Regardless of all this, a sound played as loud as 194&nbsp;dB is quite literally deafening, so the ringtone would be not so much annoying as dangerous, which would probably have it disqualified from the competition.\n*\"That noise from Dumb & Dumber\". {{w|Dumb and Dumber}} is a comedy movie from 1994. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cVlTeIATBs The noise] from Dumb & Dumber is referring to the point in the movie when Harry and Lloyd asked, \"Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?\" and began shrieking in imitation of a loud fax machine.\n*\"Recording of a sobbing voice begging you to answer\". Self-explanatory. Such a ringtone is obviously disruptive, annoying, and potentially worrying to those in the vicinity of the phone.{{citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[At the top of the frame is a humming tone.
