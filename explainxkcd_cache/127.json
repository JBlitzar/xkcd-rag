The Asian street racers soundly beat him until he is able to master {{w|Drifting (motorsport)|drifting}}. (Lines 4 to 8 of the first panel are from the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HQ2JLlc4E Tokyo Drift trailer].)\n\nIn ''Mario Kart'', drifting is a gameplay mechanic. During a proper drift, the kart creates blue sparks, which give a small, temporary \"mini-boost\" to the speed of the kart.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] jokes about comparing a shopping cart to karts from Mario Kart by imagining blue sparks forming whenever he drifts the cart.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Text in panel:]\n:'''on the other side of the world'''\n:'''a new style of street racing'''\n:'''rules the tokyo underground'''\n:'''the cars are lighter'''\n:'''the tires are slick'''\n:'''when you drift,'''\n:'''if you ain't out of control,'''\n:'''you ain't in control.'''\n:'''and if you work the wheel'''\n:'''back and forth just right,'''\n\n:[Two cars race around a corner with blue sparks spraying from their tires.]\n:'''You get blue sparks.'''\n\n:The FAST and the FURIOUS: ''Tokyo Dash!!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Mario Kart]]"
