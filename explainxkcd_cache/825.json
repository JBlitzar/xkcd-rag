Jeffrey is famous as the picture on the Wikipedia article on 'Necrosis'.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall]] himself (looking like [[Black Hat]]) is talking to {{w|Jeffrey Rowland}} (sitting with a drink), who writes the popular webcomics [http://www.overcompensating.com Overcompensating] and [http://www.wigucomics.com/adventures/index.php Wigu]. That it is supposed to be these two real people is clear from the [http://xkcd.com/825/info.0.json official transcript] on xkcd.\n\nThis may be a reference to Scott Adams' {{w|God's Debris}}, in which a delivery guy has a long conversation about the nature of the universe with an old man. While often dealing with complex questions, the old man in the story presents arguments in a very straightforward way. Some have called some of the arguments in the book very clever and original, albeit overly simplistic. This comic could be a parody on that style of philosophy. The ridiculous theory of Jeffrey's about the correlation between Dark Matter and consciousness is perhaps a reference to Dust in author Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series, in which Dust is the associated particle with the Rusakov \"consciousness\" field, interpreted in our universe as Dark Matter. He then postulates that the reason we can't see dark matter is that we are conscious ourselves, alluding to the urban legend that, much like how a watched pot never boils, the mailman will never deliver if you are watching. He then moves on to the subject of ghosts, perpetuating the idea of how far-flung and implausible his \"theories\" are.\n\nTraditionally, {{w|turkey (meat)|turkey}} is the main dish of the U.S. {{w|Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving}} holiday.  Thus, the theory mentioned in the last panel is that {{w|Turkey (animal)|turkeys}} started the holiday in order to drive themselves to extinction.  This is a reference to the {{w|Voluntary Human Extinction Movement}} (which merely advocated for people not reproducing. The \"Turkey Voluntary Extinction Movement\" took this to a much higher level by promoting the mass slaughter of turkeys.)\n\nThe title text is completely true: After a brown recluse spider bit him, {{w|Jeffrey Rowland|Rowland}} started experiencing cell death in his leg. Although the wound itself is benign, it still is featured in Wikipedia articles (such as {{w|Loxoscelism}}). [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rowland_recluse_bite.jpg This] is the picture of the leg and [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Necrotic_leg_wound.png this] is the famous picture in the Necrosis article.\n\n''Guest Week'' was a series of five comics written by five other comic authors. They were released over five consecutive days (Monday-Friday); not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.<br>\nThe five comics are:\n*[[822: Guest Week: Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content)]]\n*[[823: Guest Week: David Troupes (Buttercup Festival)]]\n*[[824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot)]]\n*[[825: Guest Week: Jeffrey Rowland (Overcompensating)]]\n*[[826: Guest Week: Zach Weiner (SMBC)]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Jeffrey Rowland and Randall wearing a black hat are sitting together.
