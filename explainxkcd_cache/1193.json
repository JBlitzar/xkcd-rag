It presented a competition for students to see who could come closest to breaking a {{w|Skein (hash function)|Skein hash}} but also an aid appeal for the Wikimedia Foundation. The comic references multiple times {{w|Baidu}}, a large Chinese Internet services company. Baidu controls the predominant Internet search provider of China and is sometimes called the \"Google of China\" for the similar services it provides. Baidu Search results follow the censorship dictates of the Chinese authorities, causing it to return censored responses to searches for politically sensitive terms when executed by web browsers in China. Thus, Megan replies \"But nothing about Tiananmen Square.\" in the first panel is a reference to the {{w|1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre}} that killed hundreds of civilians. \"It takes great minds to stifle other great minds.\" and \"Let's block Canada\" in the second panel are also references to the arbitrary government censorship of Baidu and other Chinese companies.\n\nThe blank regions in the above image are dynamically generated from various sources.\n*The university that is being recruited changes depending on which university is winning the hash finding competition in the fifth panel.\n*The company doing the recruiting is randomly selected from a pool of companies. It was formerly the first NASDAQ-100 company mentioned on a varying Wikipedia page.\n*The text in the second panel may vary: See [[1193: Externalities#Second Panel|this section]].\n*The text in the third panel may vary: See [[1193: Externalities#Third Panel|this section]].\n*The text in the fourth panel may vary: See [[1193: Externalities#Fourth Panel|this section]].\n*The text in the fifth panel [[1193: Externalities#Fifth Panel|changes]], depending on which university is currently in third place in a hash finding competition. Clicking on the panel takes you to [http://almamater.xkcd.com/ a webpage] where people can enter their school's domain name and hash data, and ranks schools on how close their students can come to matching a Skein 1024 1024 hash value.\n*The text in the top half of the sixth panel may vary. See [[1193: Externalities#Sixth Panel|this section]]. The second half of the panel is always the same.\n*The last panel varies with the amount donated to the Wikimedia Foundation via [https://donate.wikimedia.org/?utm_medium=socialmedia&utm_campaign=xkcd_april1 this link]. For past images, see [[1193: Externalities#Seventh Panel|this section]].\n\n===Hashing Competition===\nFor the two days until comic 1194 appeared, a competition was underway to see who could come closest to breaking a {{w|Skein (hash function)|Skein hash}}.  The first text line of the first panel contains a link to http://almamater.xkcd.com. This page contained the text:\n\n:Currently looking for Skein 1024 1024 input matching\n<pre>5b4da95f5fa08280fc9879df44f418c8f9f12ba424b7757de02bbdfbae0d4c4fdf9317c80cc5fe04c6429073466cf29706b8c25999ddd2f6540d4475cc977b87f4757be023f19b8f4035d7722886b78869826de916a79cf9c94cc79cd4347d24b567aa3e2390a573a373a48a5e676640c79cc70197e1c5e7f902fb53ca1858b6</pre>\n\nOn this page, users were invited to enter \"Your school's domain name\" — presumably intended to be their college alma mater. (At least in the beginning, only a few top-level domains were accepted.) If the user entered an acceptable domain (by xkcd's rules, which apparently changed during the 48 hours of the competition), they could then enter data values one at a time. For each data value entered, xkcd returned a hash value and the number of bits by which it differed from the target value. The object was to achieve the lowest possible number of differing bits, ideally zero.\n\nA ranking page showed the lowest value achieved for each domain name entered, but not the data that achieved it. The first name on the list was substituted in various panels, and the third-place school showed in panel five. No data values were reported by xkcd, but various results were posted by users of the xkcd forums and on other websites, leading to copycat submissions, so that occasionally large numbers of institutions would show the same moderately low value.\n\nAfter the end of the contest, the data submission page vanished, replaced by the final list of rankings, which shows that Carnegie Mellon University achieved the best score with 384 bits incorrect out of 1024.  The rankings only show a few hundred out of the several thousand domains submitted&mdash;presumably Randall chose to chop the copycat submissions off the end of the list, retaining only honestly obtained results.\n\n===First Panel===\nIn some cases, Megan's reply seems to correspond to the company.\n{| class=\"wikitable table-padding\"\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you applied to [company] yet?\n:Megan: The recruiter hasn't emailed me back in over three minutes.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you applied to [company] yet?\n:Megan: The recruiter hasn't emailed me back in over an hour!\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you thought of a career at [company]?\n:Megan: I'm not that good at math.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you thought of a career at [company]?\n:Megan: What do they even do?\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you thought of a career at [company]?\n:Megan: I don't like monopolies.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you thought of a career at [company]?\n:Megan: Only in my darkest moments.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Be part of the Apple experience!\n:Megan: I'm not really a fan of turtlenecks.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Come work at Microsoft!\n:Megan: I only came to this tech talk for the xbox giveaway.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Y U No Work Yahoo?\n:Megan: I like working from home!\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Become a partner at Starbucks!\n:Megan: But green's not my colour.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Come work in the Amazon!\n:Megan: I don't have to actually move to South America, do I?\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you thought of a career at [company]?\n:Megan: Not after that presentation.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Thought about working for Intel?\n:Megan: I'm not that great at division.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Dude, you should work at Dell!\n:Megan: That catchphrase is so old.\n|-\n|\n:Ahoy, carnegie melonites!\n:Have you thought of a career at [company]?\n:Megan: Not after that presentation.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Have you looked for a job at Kraft Foods?\n:Megan: I'm allergic to sugar\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:How about working for Whole Foods?\n:Megan: Could I afford the food if I did?\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Come work at EBay!\n:Megan: Maybe if they made a good bid.\n|-\n|\n:Hey, [university] students!\n:Come work for Activision... er...
