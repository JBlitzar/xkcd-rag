Winner: pregnancy test and single coat hanger.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThere's a fairly well-founded meme that singles looking for other singles can make connections with others in the fresh produce sections of a supermarket. From a single lady's point of view, men who are buying such goods are more likely to be unattached, due to the traditionally skewed gender politics of who shops for what in a couple, and at the same time, the man is exhibiting good habits in not merely stocking up on ready-meals or subsisting on takeaways while living the bachelor life.\n\nBy standing in a produce aisle with a tube of {{w|K-Y Jelly}} (which is most commonly used as a sexual lubricant) in his hand and considering what produce to buy (between bananas, apples, oranges, zucchinis, and doubtless much more off-screen), [[Cueball]] is allowing other people to believe that he either has plans to have sex with any connection he might manage to take home with him, or also he plans to use the chosen produce item to pleasure himself, probably sexually.\n\nCueball is probably not actually planning on doing either,{{Citation needed}} but he loves to see the look on people's faces; hence, he's collecting double-takes.\n\nIn the title text, he says he likes to play a game of \"freak out the cashier using two items.\" Wire coat hangers have been used to perform {{w|Unsafe abortion | do-it-yourself abortions}}, many times with disastrous effects, such as internal hemorrhaging and the death of the woman. The combination of a pregnancy test and a coat hanger will be concerning to any cashier, regardless of their opinion on abortion, for this reason; it will be doubly concerning for a pro-life cashier.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in the middle of the produce aisle in a supermarket, holding a tube of K-Y Jelly in one hand, the other on his chin. The signs read \"Bananas\" \"Apples\" \"Oranges\" and \"Zucchini\" from left to right. Megan and a Cueball-like friend are also in the same aisle.]\n:MY HOBBY: Standing in the supermarket's produce section holding a tube of K-Y Jelly, looking contemplative.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
