It contains the variety and relative concentrations of the simple molecular constituents found in the injectable mixture. Coronavirus mRNA vaccines contain mostly water, with some mRNA, a few fats (e.g., a {{w|PEGylation|PEGylated}} lipid and cholesterol), sugar (sucrose), and {{w|tromethamine}} {{w|Buffer solution|buffer}} to stabilize pH.[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html] The cocktail contains mostly water, some sugar, fats, either an {{w|Glutamic acid|amino acid}} salt ''or'' biological and genetic material, and the other constituents of {{w|mayonnaise}}.\n\nThe word cocktail in the context of drugs can mean several things, including medically designed combinations of drugs.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161208121908.htm] That's not so far in concept from the current formulation of COVID-19 booster, which targets both the original and BA.5 variants of the virus.\n\nLike much of what we eat or drink, the stomach and intestines will neutralize much of the complexity of either the vaccines or this ersatz replica of them, reducing them to simpler components of some nutritional value. For the vaccine to work, it has been designed to be injected into the body e.g. {{w|intramuscular}}ly to bypass the hostile environment of the human digestive system. While there are similar vaccines administered as a nasal spray, the fragility of mRNA in the digestive system has curtailed the search for ingestible analogs. [[Randall]]'s replacement mixture is nontoxic, and contains water, proteins and calories, all important nutritional components. Because it doesn't contain a complete spectrum of essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals,[https://www.foodpro.huds.harvard.edu/foodpro/label.asp?locationNum=15&locationName=Dining+Hall&dtdate=5%2F8%2F2015&RecNumAndPort=051021*1] you can't live on it alone.\n\nThe {{w|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)}} is the US national public health agency.  They make recommendations about vaccine use.  {{w|Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony Fauci}} has been the chief infectious disease advisor to numerous US Presidents and has often been interviewed regarding COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe instruction to serve in {{w|shot glasses}} is a play on words, as \"shot\" can mean {{w|Injection (medicine)|injection}} in medicine. One {{w|Jigger (bartending)|jigger}} is only 0.19 of a cup, so the recipe serves up to five.\n\nThe title text suggests the mixture can be served as a \"booster\" to a prior dose. The comic recommends not redosing within two months of the last attempt.  The current mRNA coronavirus booster is approved for use at least 2 months after previous immunization.  Too little time between doses of a vaccine may reduce benefit from the booster.  However most pairs of distinct vaccines work well if delivered on the same day.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\nThis comic coincided with the [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-use widespread availability of the bivalent COVID vaccines in the US.] It's another entry in a [[:Category:COVID-19|series of comics]] related to the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}, specifically regarding the [[:Category:COVID-19 vaccine|COVID-19 vaccine]]. It was, however, almost a year since the vaccines were mentioned last in [[2532: Censored Vaccine Card]], released almost 11 month before this one, and more than 8 months since the last comic to directly feature COVID-19, which was [[2563: Throat and Nasal Passages]], that came out as the first comic in 2022. It's also another comic with [[:Category:Comics with cursed items|cursed items]]. Disgusting drinks served in shot glasses, and related to people with colds, are mentioned in the volume section of [[526: Converting to Metric]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:Ever wondered what it would be like to drink the new COVID booster?\n:This recipe approximately recreates the taste and nutritional profile!\n:''(Note: does not protect against COVID.)''\n\n:[The following two testimonies are displayed in spiky bubbles.]\n:\"...What?
