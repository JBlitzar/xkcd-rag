Fiber signals move at ~200,000km/s.\n:(minus network lag)\n\n:This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them.\n:[There is a geographical border on a map; the front edge of the wave of the quake is shown, with the front edge of the wave of tweets surpassing it.]\n\n:People outside this radius may get word of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS ''before'' the shaking hits.\n:[Megan and Cueball are standing, holding cell phones. Megan is looking at hers.]\n:Megan: Whoa!
