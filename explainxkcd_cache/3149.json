The actual origins of the saying are not clear (it applies to many other trades  and activities just as well as carpentry), but the meaning remains the same — it refers to the importance of planning and checking multiple times before acting, in order to prevent mistakes (in all avenues of life — not just where cutting is involved). When a job requires cutting material to particular specifications, cuts are generally not practical to undo. If a cut is made in error, there are several possibilities, none of which are desirable. In some cases, the piece can be saved with additional work, which takes additional time and effort. If the error is minor, the piece might be used anyway, but that will result in ill-fitting pieces and an inferior end product. If none of that works, then the material has to be replaced by another piece, which must then be cut properly before the job can continue, wasting time, effort, and material. Experienced craftspeople quickly learn that the (usually fairly trivial) effort of double-checking measurements involves far less work and expense than dealing with the consequences of bad cuts. \n\nThe comic takes the proverb literally, showing a graph of various activities involving measuring and/or cutting, which shows the approximate ratio of measurements to cuts (though it does not provide actual values). From most to least measurements (top to bottom in the plot<!-- surely better narrative by starting with the good->bad->worse carpenter trilogy, *then* looking at the others? ...but YMMV -->):\n\n;    Surveyor (≥4 measurements, ~0 cuts)\n{{w|surveying|Surveyors}} have the task of measuring land. They measure boundaries, elevations, and distances, but are rarely asked to physically cut anything themselves; they only produce measurements and maps, for which they typically would make multiple measurements to ensure accurate and thorough charts for those who will make later use of them.\n\nSurveyors often need to have trees and bushes cleared from a property line to be able to see or measure from one corner to another. These are called \"cuts\" in some American jargon. However, surveyors may ask others to do this work, in advance, rather than do this themselves, and even then it would be \"cut, then measure\" rather than \"measure, then cut\".\n\n;    Surgeon (~3 measurements, ~1 cut)\n{{w|Surgery}} is a task requiring a great deal of precision, being on a living creature, not an inanimate object, and therefore having potentially more significant consequences if an error occurs. Surgery always involves cutting to some degree, but this is generally preceded by careful diagnosis, measurement and planning. It is important for surgeons to minimize the number of cuts that are made, and to keep those deliberate and precise to achieve their goals with as little trauma and damage as possible.\n\n;    Good Carpenter (~2 measurements, ~1 cut)\nThe titular proverb at the core of the comic, that suggests that a good carpenter should follow a ratio of two measurements for every cut. \n\n;    Careless Carpenter (~1 measurement, ~1 cut)\nA careless carpenter would only make one measurement for every cut, resulting in an effectively equal ratio between the two. This is assumed to increase the incidence of bad cuts.\n\n;    Really Bad Carpenter (<1 measurement, ~2 cuts)\nA \"really bad carpenter\" is shown as making more cuts than measurements. This could be explained by the carpenter in question making cuts based on rough estimations rather than measurements, or by having to repeatedly recut many of their pieces, without measuring each time. This makes precision more or less impossible to achieve, and likely makes far inferior products, with much more waste (assuming the projects are even completed). \n\n;    Serial Killer (0 measurements, ≥3 cuts)\nThis graph suggests a serial killer who kills with knives or other bladed instruments. Murder rarely involves actual measurements,<!--{{Citation needed}}--> because a low level of precision is often adequate to kill someone, and victims would not generally allow themselves to be measured.{{Citation Needed}} Instead, killers would be expected to stab or slash at their victims repeatedly, resulting in a high number of cuts and no measurements at all. Alternatively, this may be a reference to the {{w|Serial killer|definition of serial killers}} as an individual who has killed three or more people in separate events.\n\n;    Title text\nThe title text mentions a carpenter who has \"achieved enlightenment\", and does zero measuring and zero cutting, because they have \"realized the wood is fine where it is\". This is a play on the notion of {{w|Zen|philosophical enlightenment}}, where the epitome of expertise is pursued, not by better craftsmanship, but by coming to appreciate things as they already exist. Thus an \"enlightened\" carpenter would be pretty useless as a carpenter, as they would have no motivation to actually do carpentry.\n\n==Transcript==\nCaption at the top of the panel: \"'Measure twice, cut once' -carpentry proverb\" with boxes around \"twice\" and \"once\".\n\nBelow that, a scatter plot with X and Y axes labeled \"number of cuts\" and \"number of measurements\", respectively.\nAt different places on the scatter plot lie six labels:\n:Surveyor: very high number of measurements, no cuts\n:Surgeon: high number of measurements, low number of cuts\n:Good carpenter: middling number of measurements, same number of cuts as surgeon\n:Careless carpenter: fewer measurements than good carpenter, same number of cuts as surgeon\n:Really bad carpenter: slightly fewer measurements than other carpenters, fairly high number of cuts\n:Serial killer: no measurements, very high number of cuts\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Scatter plots]]"
