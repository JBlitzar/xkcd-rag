Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\nAs indicated in the comic, \"Measure twice, cut once\" is a {{w|proverb}}, which means that planning and checking multiple times before acting is less costly than the mistakes that can follow from not doing so. The metaphor is of marking the place on a piece of material where you plan to cut and then verifying that measurement before cutting, to avoid the later waste involved in either trimming down the cut piece, or starting again with a whole new piece, if it turns out the first measurement was in error. ([[Randall]] claims it as a \"carpentry proverb\", but in fact it is not clear what it specifically originates in reference to, and it could equally well apply in a literal sense to other activities such as tailoring, leather-working, and so on.)\n\nThe comic takes the proverb literally, consisting of a graph of various activities involving measuring and/or cutting, showing the number of cuts made versus measurements (though it does not provide actual values). Starting with the carpenters, these are:\n\n;    Good Carpenter (2 measurements, 1 cut)\nA good carpenter would measure twice and cut once, if following the archetypal proverb.\n\n;    Careless Carpenter (1 measurement, 1 cut)\nA careless carpenter would measure just once, then cut once, not following the proverb. This could lead to simple mistakes that create pieces that don't actually fit, and thus waste wood (and/or time) in order to fix the issues.\n\n;    Really Bad Carpenter (<1 measurement, 2 cuts)\nA particularly poor carpenter would not always measure even once (here indicated by being ''slightly'' lower on the plot than the presumed 1-measurement position) and cut twice or more, almost following the proverb in reverse. It also suggests that they may not merely have not measured correctly, but aren't even skilled enough to have tried to apply the correct measurements in the first place. While a careless carpenter might muddle through with the occasional error, it is likely that the really bad one makes even more mistakes and wastes even more wood.\n\nThe remaining classifications are not carpenters at all.\n\n;    Surgeon (3 measurements, 1 cut)\n{{w|Surgery}} is a task requiring a great deal of precision, being on a living creature, not an inanimate object, and therefore having far less room for error. Extensive measurements and diagnoses must be performed prior to making cuts, but cuts are still made. The cuts are minimal (once, when possible) and must be deliberate and precise. This positions the surgeon at beyond even the Good Carpenter for the number of pre-cut measurements.\n\n;    Surveyor (≥4 measurements, 0 cuts)\nSurveyors have the task of measuring land. They measure boundaries, elevations, and distances, but are rarely asked to physically cut anything themselves; they only produce measurements and maps, for which they typically would make multiple measurements to ensure accurate and thorough charts for those who will make later use of them.\n\nSurveyors often need to clear trees and bushes from a property line to be able to see or measure from one corner to another. These are called \"cuts\" in some American jargon.\n\n;    Serial Killer (0 measurements, ≥3 cuts)\nWould not normally require any particular attempted measurement at all, depending upon their particular ''{{w|Modus operandi#Term|modus operandi}}''. But if this involves knives, multiple victims would necessarily require potentially large amounts of cutting, stabbing, slashing, etc. The placement at about the 3-cuts mark may also be a reference to a serial killer being characterized as having killed at least three people.\n\n;    Title text\nThe title text mentions a carpenter who does zero measuring and zero cutting. This is depicted as the epitome of expertise, because they have apparently achieved a superior {{w|Zen|philosophical enlightenment}} towards their task, perhaps being able to achieve their aim with the materials exactly as already provided by fate, or to adjust their aims to align with the existing reality of the universe.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:a caption saying \"measure twice cut once -carpentry proverb\" with boxes around twice and once\n:a scatter plot with x and y axis labeled number of cuts and number of measurements respectively, under the caption\n:on the scatter plot lies 6 differently labelled points:\n:surveyor: very high number of measurements, no cuts\n:surgeon: high number of measurements, almost middling number of cuts\n:good carpenter: middling number of measurements, same number of cuts as surgeon\n:careless carpenter: a number of measurements slightly lower than the good carpenter, same number of cuts as good carpenter\n:really bad carpenter: low number of measurements, high number of cuts\n:serial killer: no measurements, very high number of cuts\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Scatter plots]]"
