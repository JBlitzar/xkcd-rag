When people in the United States first started receiving their vaccine shots, a large number of them shared photos of the CDC vaccination proof cards that they received alongside the vaccines; it was enough of a trend that the {{w|Federal Trade Commission|FTC}} released an official statement warning vaccine recipients [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/02/social-media-no-place-covid-19-vaccination-cards not to share photos], due to the cards containing {{w|Personal data|personal identification}} that probably should not be made public. \n\nThe irony here is that [[Randall]] has \"{{w|Sanitization (classified information)|censored}}\" (redacted) some impersonal lines, such as the instructions that are identical on all vaccination cards, and many easy-to-guess lines, while not censoring any of said personal information.\nConsidering the date of the 3rd dose (one day prior to the comic's uploading), it is likely that the blackouts in the last line are only covering whitespace.\n\nAnother possible reference here is to the practice of filing for {{w|Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA}} requests that has been getting more popular in recent years, with sites like muckrock.com developing to support it.  These requests provide for citizens to view the contents of government files, but the files first go through a process of redaction via solid black rectangles.  The information that is redacted can seem random, ridiculous, and frustrating, and be a source of legal action.\n\nThe caption indicates that his intention is to \"seem more mysterious\". This is best exemplified by the blanking of most of the word \"clinician\" to leave the acronym \"{{w|Central Intelligence Agency|CIA}}\", referring to the US government agency known for its frequently \"mysterious\" (classified) activity, as well as its liberal use of redaction like that in the comic.\n\n[[File:CDC_COVID-19_Vaccination_Record_Card.jpg|thumb|300px|A real and appropriately censored CDC vaccination record.]]\n\nThe \"19\" in COVID-19 is systematically censored in the comic. This is humorous because currently COVID-19 is the only thing that could be meant by \"COVID-[anything]\", and so the redaction is pointless. This may also be intended, in the interest of mystery, to imply some future outbreak of a similar disease (given an identifier based on the year of its inception).\n\nThe sentence at the top of the card, which appears once in English and once in Spanish, has equivalent portions redacted in both languages:\n* \"medical information\" and \"the vaccines you have received\" in the English version, and\n* \"<span lang=\"es\">información médica</span>\" and \"<span lang=\"es\">las vacunas que ha recibido</span>\" in the Spanish.\nThis is one of the comics (another being [[1434: Where Do Birds Go]]) including a sentence (or, given the censorship, at least a good portion of one) in Spanish.\n\n{{w|CVS Pharmacy}} is a pharmacy chain in the US which provides COVID-19 vaccinations.  CVS #05309 is in Pineville, LA, while Randall lives in Massachusetts; it is not clear why he would have received his first vaccine dose in Louisiana.\n\nThe title text comments on the \"Provider or clinic site\" of the second dose on the card. Where the word \"pharmacy\" appears in the previous row (and would be on a real card), it is censored in the comic. The most reasonable assumption is that the word is still \"pharmacy\" and that Randall has simply chosen to redact that instance for some reason, but the title text humorously implies that it was in fact some ''other'' CVS-related venture where he got his second dose, for instance a \"CVS parking lot\" or perhaps an {{w|anti-submarine warfare carrier}}.\n\nCVS's parent company, {{w|CVS Health}}, does have other enterprises with compatible names: {{w|CVS Caremark}} and {{w|CVS Health#CVS Specialty|CVS Specialty}}. However, neither of these provide COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\n===Numerical trivia===\nRandall's patient number is the 2nd to 9th digits of the fractional part of the decimal expansion of {{w|pi}} inclusively: 41592653.\n\nThe lot numbers of the first and second doses allude to two numbers that appear frequently in Star Wars and other works related to George Lucas: {{w|THX 1138#Etymology and references|1138}}, and {{w|21-87#Influence on George Lucas|2187}}. Forty comics later, in [[2572: Alien Observers]], THX 1138 is also indirectly referenced in the number of one of the humans mentioned. The lot number of the third dose is the {{w|1729 (number)|Ramanujan-Hardy number}}. \n\nThe Clinician number for the first shot is the last 4 digits of the phone number for {{w|867-5309/Jenny|\"Jenny\" 867-5309}}, which has been entered into communication technology by a massive number of people.\n\nGiven the reasonable assumption{{citation needed}} that the partially censored year relates to the twentieth century, the date of birth on the card corresponds to that given in the acknowledged [[Randall_Munroe#Timeline|timeline]] for Randall. The censorship of that specific part of his date of birth might be related to the fact that the number \"19\" has been systematically redacted on the card. Another interpretation is that Randall is implying he is either over one hundred years old or a time traveler, although neither is likely to be true.{{citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Profile picture of a Cueball's head and shoulders, with unreadable lines of text to the right.]\n:Check it out, I just got my booster! \n\n:[Picture of the U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card attached on a media post.
