Why did I join the stinging insect of the month club, anyway?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall]] notes that package tracking, as provided by many shipping companies like {{w|United Parcel Service|UPS}} and {{w|FedEx Express}}, is helpful, as customers can see the status of their package delivery, and most people are very excited in the expectation of a package as shown in [[576: Packages]]. However, [[Megan]] refreshes the package tracking page every few minutes in her impatience on the status of her package; it drives her crazy.\n\nThe headquarters of FedEx Express are located in Memphis, and it also serves as its global \"SuperHub\" located at {{w|Memphis International Airport}}.\n\nThe title text refers to the various \"''x'' of the month clubs\" (fruit, cheese, wine, etc.) that one might have signed up for, only to receive a gift. But you are often not really interested in these gifts, and probably even less interested in receiving a stinging insect each month.{{citation needed}} This, combined with the ease by which a person can track the package, creates a strange dichotomy whereby you don't really want the package, but you keep checking where it is just because you can.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Online Package Tracking:\n:<u>Pros:</u> Convenient, Useful\n:<u>Cons:</u> Makes you crazy\n\n:[Megan is sitting at a computer.]\n:<nowiki>*refresh*</nowiki>\n:Megan: Aww, still in Memphis.\n:<nowiki>*refresh*</nowiki>\n:Megan: Aww, still in Memphis.\n:<nowiki>*refresh*</nowiki>\n:Megan: Aww, still in Memphis.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
