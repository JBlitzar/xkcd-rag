In this comic, MacGyver suggests an unusually direct plan—shooting the guard in the head. However, he still manages to describe his plan in a way that makes it sound like a typical MacGyver-style miraculous improvisation.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in the show, MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns, and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the old series. In addition, his devices, traps, and plans were generally designed to be non-lethal, typically causing no more than minor injuries. The notion of him simply killing a guard would be a major departure for the show. \n\n{{w|MacGyver (2016 TV series)|A MacGyver reboot was made in 2016}} and was not well received (38% on Metacritic, 4.6/10 in iMDb). Despite this negative reception, the series began its fifth season in December 2020.\n\nThe Wikipedia page referenced by the title text redirects to the main MacGyver entry since September 2012.
