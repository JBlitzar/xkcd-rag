He is posting a {{w|Twitter}} comment (a \"{{w|Conversation threading|thread}}\" that's only one comment long, hence \"1/1\") about \"{{w|Pern#Thread|Thread}}\", a massively destructive alien organism from the same series. {{w|Pern}} is a fictional human-colonized planet and the main setting of the series.\n\nTypically, when starting a series of tweets (used to post content longer than 140 characters), one will start the first tweet with \"Thread: \" and end it with 1/X. The second tweet will read 2/X, and so on. If X, the total number of tweets, is unknown at the start, it will be listed or 1/many or omitted: 1/\n\nHere, there is a play on the Twitter thread and the actual threat to Pern.\n\nThe use of threads on Twitter became significantly more common in 2016 and through 2017. The title text dubs this \"Threadfall.\" In the Pern novels, Threadfall is also the name for the beginning of 50-year cyclic periods when Thread attacks the world of Pern and its inhabitants, which occur between relatively safe \"Intervals\" of around 200 years. Since according to the title text Threadfall occurred in 2016, it should be expected to continue for ~50 more years until the mid-2060s, when the next Interval will begin.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A mock-up of a “tweet” from the site twitter.com is shown. It contains a mock-up of a user photo of the fictional character F’nor that resembles [[Hairy]], including a tiny line sketch of F’nor’s brown dragon Canth flying overhead. Below the tweet are several action buttons typical of a Twitter post for comments, replying, likes, etc.]\n\n:F’nor\n:<span style=\"color:gray\">@fnor</span>\n:Thread: The greatest threat to our life on Pern 1/1\n\n==Trivia==\nOn Friday, the header was replaced with a message from Randall about how he would be visiting the U.K. on the following week. It read as follows: \n  I'll be visiting the UK next week! You can join me in London from September 30-October 2 (at New Scientist Live, The Royal Institution, and Intelligence Squared), then from October 3-6 in York, Edinburgh, Cambridge and Ely, Oxford, and Cheltenham.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category: Comics featuring Hairy]]"
