Amid the chaos, though, there are two people, [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]], staring wistfully at each other. They both think of the same scene: the two of them sitting on branches of a large and bare tree, doing something on laptops. The implication is that these two people are different - they don't derive their enjoyment of life from parties or other typical teenage activities, but rather simpler, more quiet activities. This is evidenced by the fact that everything other than Megan and Cueball (and the [[Wikipedia:Solo Cup Company|Red Solo cup]]s) are grayed out.\n\nThe title text presents a simpler joke - it is rather difficult to get down from a tree, especially when carrying a fragile item like a laptop. It may also refer to the design of the tree that has been drawn, as it lacks (visible) branches below Cueball's perch.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In a loud party, Megan and Cueball are looking at each other, both thinking of the same scene: they are sitting on opposite branches of a large leafless tree, each with a laptop. There's cloud in the distance and a grass field around the tree.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
