The plot is fully populated, with many issues (both common and uncommon) matching expectations pretty well, as well as features that are much rarer than expected (like encounters with quicksand, crocodiles and explosives), and some very common issues that don't occur to young people, such as deciding what to eat, or dealing with weird noises and smells.\n\nIt is clear that much of the 'lower-right triangle' (things that don't come up nearly as often as expected) are ''direct'' references to fictional scenarios on film or TV, likely particularly the type of fiction that [[Randall]] consumed as a child (probably including cartoons and action movies). In contrast, the complimentary 'upper-left triangle' largely consists of the type of mundane adult activities that children don't see or notice in real life, and which often aren't interesting enough to be disproportionately common in fiction.\n\n==Events==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Event\n! Expected frequency in adulthood\n! Actual frequency in adulthood\n! Notes\n|-\n| {{w|Eating utensil etiquette#Fork etiquette|Which fork you're supposed to use for what}}\n| 0%\n| 3%\n| Traditional, formal dining involves {{w|Fork#Types of forks|different types of forks}} for different courses of a meal. Learning {{w|Table setting#Place setting|which fork to use}} for which course might be taught in {{w|etiquette school}}, and is perceived as a signifier of social class (though this is likely an exaggerated concern). Dining has generally become less formal in Western society since the mid-20th century; as a result, most people are used to only using a single fork, or at most two, for their meals. This means that, for most people, {{tvtropes|FormalFullArrayOfCutlery|the issue rarely comes up}}, even in adulthood.\n|-\n| {{tvtropes|CartoonBomb|Lit fuses}}\n| 40%\n| 0%\n| Explosives with visible lit fuses are commonly seen in movies and TV shows, particularly in cartoons. In reality, the average person is unlikely to deal with explosives at all. When explosives are used, they're usually electrically detonated, or sometimes use a concealed fuse (e.g. {{w|grenade}}s). Visible, burning fuses are sufficiently obsolete that most people will never encounter them directly. \n|-\n| {{tvtropes|PalatePropping|Shoving a stick}} in a {{w|crocodile}}'s mouth to wedge it open\n| 80%\n| 0%\n| Placing a vertical stick in a crocodileâ€™s mouth is a popular TV trope to prevent the crocodile from {{w|Crocodile attack|biting down}} (usually on the stick placer). Crocodile attacks on humans are common only in specific geographical areas, meaning that most people will never encounter them. Even when such an encounter happens, using a stick in that way would almost certainly be ineffective.  \n|-\n| {{w|Quicksand}}\n| 100%\n| 0%\n| Quicksand is {{tvtropes|QuicksandSucks|common in adventure fiction}}, but it's quite rare in real life (nor does it generally behave the way it's depicted in such fiction). The average person is unlikely to ever encounter it. \n|- \n| {{w|Car chase}}s\n| 35%\n| 5%\n| Car chases are frequently seen in movies and TV shows involving police, including real-life police shows, but unless you're a police officer or criminal trying to evade them, you'll probably never be involved in one. \n|-\n| {{w|Grappling hook}}s\n| 100%\n| 5%\n| A grappling hook is a device, typically made of metal, with multiple hooks and features to allow it to be secured to the end of a rope. It can be thrown to either grab an object at a distance and pull it toward you, or to anchor the rope to an elevated point (such as on a cliff or building) to aid in climbing. The latter use is quite common in action and adventure fiction. While such devices do exist in real life, they generally have specialty uses that the average person is unlikely to have the need for. \n|-\n| People offering free drugs\n| 30%\n| 10%\n| Children being warned about illicit drugs have often been cautioned that {{tvtropes|TheAggressiveDrugDealer|drug dealers would inevitably approach them and offer them free drugs}}, in order to encourage an addiction and gain a reliable customer. In real life, drug dealers virtually never work that way, and are unlikely to part with their product unless payment has been made. Most people are introduced to drugs by friends or acquaintances, who might offer some for free, but that's only likely in specific social groups and situations. The TV Tropes page for this trope, however, contains an analysis of why children may be ''told'' that this would happen.\n|-\n| {{w|Parachute}}s\n| 80%\n| 10%\n| {{w|Parachuting}} allows people to jump out of planes at altitude, or from other elevated heights, and slow their descent enough to land safely. This is dramatic enough to come up often in adventure fiction. Parachutes are, of course, used in real life, but most people will only have reason to use them if they put the money and effort into recreational skydiving or {{w|BASE jumping}}. \n|-\n| {{w|Barrels}}\n| 95%\n| 10%\n| Wooden or {{w|Drum (container)|metal}} storage containers are frequently used as concealment, improvised weapons and (sometimes explosive) obstacles in popular media. While barrels are actually quite common, they're large enough that the majority of people rarely have a reason to interact with them, unless they happen to work in a job that either sells or uses liquids in large quantities.\n|-\n| {{w|Middle name}}s\n| 15%\n| 20%\n| A second (or occasionally also third or more) {{w|given name}}, common in some traditions. In most Anglophone countries, having a middle name is common, but most people only use them in formal situations where a full name is required (as when filling out legal documents), or if they adopt the middle name to be known by (in which case, most people will not realise this). This is true to the point where most people don't know the middle names of most of their acquaintances, or even if they have one. In consequence, both as a child and as an adult, middle names will be encountered occasionally, but not regularly.\n|-\n| {{w|Food fight}}s\n| 50%\n| 20%\n| A common trope in fiction has a young people eating together (often in a cafeteria), and someone playfully begins throwing food, causing others to retaliate, until the whole room devolves into a food fight. Such a fight is inherently messy and irresponsible, but is unlikely to actually hurt anyone seriously, and so represents youthful hijinks. Such events aren't unknown in real life, but aren't necessarily pleasant (food is wasted and people might miss their meal as a result, you might end up covered in food all day, clean-up is a big job, punishments are likely to be handed out, and clothes might be permanently stained), so they aren't nearly as common as someone raised on fiction might imagine. Adults are most likely to encounter them being indulged in by the children in their life, rather than taking part themselves.\n|-\n| {{tvtropes|TwinSwitch|Twins switching places}}\n| 90%\n| 20%\n| In fiction, if a pair of identical twins are introduced, it's almost inevitable that they'll trade places at some point, each trying to pass for the other, whether as a prank, or for some more serious purpose (a version of {{w|Chekhov's gun}}), such as in the movie {{w|The Parent Trap}}. Actual identical twins are quite rare (roughly 1 in 300 live births), even identical twins might not look exactly alike, and many twins get tired of being confused for one another at a young age, and so have no interest trying to trade places as adults. Frankly, a real life percentage above 0% may be a joke. \n|-\n| {{w|Flat tire}}s\n| 10%\n| 25%\n| Anyone who drives or rides a vehicle with tires faces the possibility of a tire going flat, due to either wear or road damage. This is usually merely an inconvenience, as it requires stopping to change or patch the tire, but a person lacking the knowledge or equipment to do so might have to call for help and/or be stranded until help arrives. Young people tend to be aware of this possibility, but it may happen a bit more often than they'd expect. \n|-\n| {{w|Briefcase}}s\n| 70%\n| 25%\n| Frequently used to carry documents and other small office equipment, they've historically been treated as part of the standard kit for a white collar worker. In fiction, they are often portrayed as {{tvtropes|BriefcaseFullOfMoney|a means to carry a large amount of cash}}, {{tvtropes|BriefcaseBlaster|conceal a firearm}}, or a {{tvtropes|MacGuffin}}. The popularity of briefcases has been declining after the 1980s. In modern times, documents are likely to be kept digitally and people are far more likely to carry a laptop bag for work than a briefcase. \n|-\n| {{w|Martial arts}}\n| 95%\n| 25%\n| A child raised on action films and TV shows may assume that use of martial arts is a normal part of life for most adults. In reality, most adults aren't trained in martial arts, and those who are very rarely use them in an actual fight. Martial arts are generally encountered only in classes or competitions set up specifically for it.\n|-\n| {{w|Water damage}}\n| 0%\n| 25%\n| Water getting into the wrong places can be a serious problem, causing damage to homes and other buildings, vehicles, infrastructure, and all kinds of property. Such damage can happen without much warning, can be hard to detect at first, and can be hard to deal with. While precautions are usually taken to prevent such things from getting wet, water incursion can still happen, due to weather events, flooding, plumbing leaks, accidental spills, and even condensation. Children are likely to be entirely unaware of this, but many adults have to deal with it at some point in their lives. \n|-\n| {{w|Backpack}}s\n| 40%\n| 40%\n| Backpacks of various sizes are a versatile means to carry items. Children in the United States are generally expected and/or required to use them to carry textbooks and school supplies, making them a normal and typical part of life. While not all adults use backpacks, far more do so now than in [[Randall]]'s childhood (for instance, in place of briefcases). They remain a very practical way to carry loads, particularly when traveling, or for such activities as hiking. [[Randall]] has referred to his interest in backpacks in a number of strips. \n|-\n| My {{w|Transcript (education)|academic record}}\n| 95%\n| 30%\n| A child's life revolves around school: it's where they spend a large fraction of their waking hours, classmates make up most of their social circle, class schedules dictate when and how they spend their free time, and parental figures often punish/reward children based on their academic performance. The child may assume that school will continue to be an ever-present all-ecompassing feature of their future life, with their grades constituting a \"permanent record\" that will follow them into adulthood.\nIn reality, academic records aren't anywhere near that important. Some entry-level jobs may consider a candidate's past grades, but they're a tertiary concern after job interviews and professional references. By the time a person reaches their late 20s, academic records become irrelevant and are supplanted by the person's professional rÃ©sumÃ©.\n|-\n| {{w|Adhesive}}s\n| 15%\n| 50%\n| Adhesives such as {{w|glue}}, {{w|adhesive tape|tape}} and {{w|epoxy resin}} are used to bond items together, typically for use in arts and crafts. They also have widespread industrial applications. A common entertainment trope is being stuck to someone else or something resulting in hilarity for the audience and inconvenience for the unfortunate protagonists.  While these types of accidents do happen in real life, typically the adhesive is easy to remove at best and at worst will result in property damage.  Less often but a very real concern is it can cause burns or serious skin damage, inhalation issues or blindness and potentially death.\n|- \n| {{w|Board game}}s\n| 60%\n| 50%\n| Board games of various kinds (such as {{w|chess}}, {{w|checkers|checkers/draughts}}, {{w|Monopoly (game)|Monopoly}}, {{w|Parcheesi}}/{{w|Ludo}}, {{w|Risk (game)|Risk}}, {{w|Snakes & Ladders}}, {{w|Cluedo|Clue/Cluedo}}, {{w|Trivial Pursuit}} or [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3149/lost-valley-of-the-dinosaurs Lost Valley of the Dinosaurs]) were often a staple for family home entertainment, in the past.  The use of such games has likely declined somewhat with the evolution of other entertainment options (such as video games), but they remain a popular social activity, with the number and complexity of such games having grown substantially.\n|-\n| Tying {{w|knot}}s\n| 85%\n| 40%\n| There are a large number of knots, with a similar variety of uses. Knowing the right types of knots can be highly useful in certain situations, but how often those situations come up heavily depends on individual circumstances. Camping, fishing and rock-climbing require tying specialty knots quite frequently, but for people who don't have such hobbies, their use is less common. The high expected frequency suggests that [[Randall]] was encouraged to learn knots as a child, possible due to involvement in {{w|scouting}}, or some other outdoor activity, and the emphasis suggested that they'd come up a lot. When interest in knot-heavy activities wanes, the application of knots tends to fall off as well. \n|-\n| {{w|Cable management}}\n| 0%\n| 50%\n| Cable management is the act of tidying up the cables in and around a computer or other device, which is an annoying but often required task for most adults. Most children are never involved in this task, and don't even realize that it exists until they're old enough to both be responsible for significant electronics and care about tidiness. Moreover, the task has become drastically more common in [[Randall]]'s lifetime as electronics have proliferated, although one possible increase in cabling (networking) has been vastly mitigated by the application of {{w|Wifi}}.\n|-\n| {{w|Laser}}s\n| 90%\n| 50%\n|Lasers are common in sci-fi and spy stories. In real life, the average person will never encounter lasers as a weapon, but they do have a number of practical applications, some that nearly everyone encounters (such as bar code readers), and others that depend on occupation and hobbies (such a laser cutting and engraving). As someone who is interested in science and technology, Randall likely encounters and uses lasers much more than the average person.\n|-\n| Dangerous driving situations\n| 40%\n| 60%\n| Dangerous driving situations, while existent in lots of {{w|Car chase|children's media}}, still would not be very expected to show up in real life. However, adults who drive have to worry about dangerous driving situations almost constantly to avoid accidents.  \n|-\n| {{w|Pizza}}\n| 55%\n| 55%\n| In the US, pizza is commonly consumed as a takeout or delivery food. it's often a favorite food for children, and is often a favorite of child-oriented characters, such as {{w|Spider-Man}} and the {{w|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}}. Since it's convenient, filling, tasty and inexpensive, adults tend to enjoy it as well, and some eat it just as frequently as they might have expected as children. \n|-\n| {{w|Star Wars}}\n| 80%\n| 55%\n| The Star Wars franchise began with the release of the eponymous film in 1977, which was followed by two sequels, and ultimately spawned a media empire of films, television shows, books, video games and merchandising which continues to this day. The series has always had appeal to both children and adults. As a childhood fan, [[Randall]] evidently expected the franchise to continue to be of importance when he was an adult. While it apparently isn't quite as prominent in his adult life as he might have expected, the franchise continues to be a significant feature in popular culture, and he seemingly [[:Category:Star Wars|remains a fan]], even decades later. \n|-\n| Cool toys\n| 95%\n| 55%\n| Children love to play with cool toys, and naÃ¯vely assume they always will. Many adults still buy cool toys, but don't play with them in order to collect them in the best condition as status symbols.\n|-\n| {{w|Weather forecast}}s\n| 10%\n| 60%\n| Children generally have very little interest in weather forecasts, outside of exceptional circumstances (such as snow days, or extreme weather events). [[Randall]], as an adult, takes an avid interest in weather and the process of forecasting it, and has created [[:Category:Weather|multiple strips dealing with the topic.]]\n|-\n| {{w|Batteries}}\n|  50%\n|  60%\n| When Randall was a child batteries would have been a necessary but annoying reality, needed to keep toys and games operating. In contrast adult devices would normally operate on mains power. However the advent of cheap and powerful {{w|lithium-ion batteries}} has meant that a large variety of devices from consumer electronics to {{w|electric vehicle|motor vehicles}} are now battery powered which Randall would probably not expected.\n|-\n| {{w|Power tools}}\n| 75%\n| 66%\n| Children are often fascinated by power tools, and are generally not allowed to use them unsupervised (or at all), due to the risk of injury. Such a child might dream of the day when they can own and use all the tools they want. How often adults actually use power tools depends heavily on occupation and lifestyle. Someone working in a building or manufacturing trade might use them constantly, others might rarely or never find an occasion to use them. \n|-\n| {{w|Video game}}s\n| 60%\n| 75%\n| During [[Randall]]'s childhood, video games were a relatively new technology, and were often dismissed as juvenile and pointless. With the passage of time, they've become increasingly common as a pastime for adults. Given the increasing complexity of electronic games, it's not uncommon for adults to spend more time on them than children. \n|-\n| Figuring out what to have for dinner\n| 10%\n| 85%\n| For many children, dinner is something that just 'arrives', having been decided on and prepared by the relevant caregiver. The simple function of making a decision probably seems trivial to children, but planning meals every day (possibly multiple times a day), involves accounting for such factors as nutrition, cost, availability of ingredients, the time and effort involved (with respect to everyone's schedules) and individual taste and possible dietary restrictions (which can become complex when dealing with multiple people). Most people also want variety in their meals, so repeating a small number of dishes can quickly become boring, but managing a large number of dishes presents more challenges. This process can take up far more mental bandwidth than children are ever aware of. Additionally, the range of foodstuffs available to affluent people in Western societies has significantly increased since Randall's childhood, which may induce choice paralysis when confronted with them.\n|-\n| {{w|Heating, ventilation and air conditioning|HVAC}} issues\n| 20%\n| 80%\n| HVAC is an acronym that stands for 'heating, ventilation and air conditioning.'  If one owns a home, problems with the heater or air conditioner can quickly make your home very uncomfortable (too cold in the winter or too hot in the summer) and becomes something you have to deal with right away. This kind of home maintenance is often virtually invisible to children, but something adults have to think about far more frequently\n|-\n| {{w|Cooking}}\n| 95%\n| 85%\n| From a child's perspective, cooking often seems to be one of the primary activities that at least one of their caregivers participate in. However, as an adult, cooking becomes less prominant as other chores become larger parts of life. Additionally, since the time that Randel was a child, convenient fast food options have increased and it has become more socially normal to eat out when an adult doesn't feel like cooking; with many adults going out to eat far more frequently than they did 4 decades ago.\n|-\n| Secret {{w|password}}s\n| 60%\n| 90%\n| Traditionally, in fiction, secret passwords have been portrayed as used for purposes such as espionage and admission to secret clubs. Children, accordingly, tend to think of them as an exciting part of adult life. In modern times, most people use secret passwords on a daily basis, but for more mundane purposes such as accessing websites and voicemail. Managing multiple passwords tends to become a chore, rather than a source of intrigue. \n|-\n| Laundry\n| 75%\n| 90%\n| The process of keeping clothing clean and organized is a routine task in virtually every household. Modern washers and dryers have reduced the time involved, but it remains a constantly ongoing job. The degree to which children are involved in this task varies (often depending on how much responsibility their parents give them), but adults have to be constantly aware of the effort involved (unless they have hired help to deal with it). \n|-\n| {{w|Tax}}es\n| 100%\n| 90%\n| According to Benjamin Franklin, taxes are one of two inevitable things in life, {{w|Death and taxes (idiom)|the other being death}}. Complaints about taxes (both their level and the effort involved in calculating them) are so common that children may grow up thinking that adults constantly have to deal with taxes, and the strip suggests that's only a mild exaggeration. For the typical American, income taxes only need to be done once a year, but taxes are generally withdrawn from every paycheck, and all major financial transactions have to be considered for tax implications. Additionally, American stores typically don't include sales tax in the listed price, so taxes have to be considered every time someone makes a purchase. \n|-\n| {{w|Customer service}}\n| 40%\n| 90%\n| Customer service is something that children do not typically notice adults needing to use (frequently used while adults or parents are at work or at other times when children are not around). Customer service phone numbers are common on many websites and apps. The goal is to help those having trouble with using websites or apps. While frequently [[806: Tech Support|basic and of little use]], it still comes up fairly frequently. Randall has made other comics about customer service, including [[806: Tech Support]] and [[627: Tech Support Cheat Sheet]].\n|-\n| Shopping\n| 100%\n| 90%\n| In modern societies, most individuals go shopping (whether in person, or online) for food and other consumables on a fairly regular basis, and for larger purchases less regularly. Children are often taken shopping by their parents from an early age, so expect shopping to happen regularly as well.\nIf anything has changed, possibly some adults now use online shopping and home delivery far more than was ever possible in their own childhood. It would still count as \"shopping\" for them, probably, but their children would not be ''taken'' shopping and wouldn't necessarily notice much of the process except the arrival of the delivery. Alongside other changes to parenting, a modern child might ''not'' experience the significantly regular and frequent event of being involved in the physical shopping trip, and be surprised when they start to have to buy things in-person/online as an adult (assuming AI-powered self-re-ordering fridges/etc don't change the whole adult situation as well). But it may mean that a version of this plot applicable to a newer generation could lower both expectation and reality scores quite significantly.\n|-\n| Unexplained smells or noises\n| 5%\n| 100%\n| With relatively few exceptions, children tend to be oblivious to subtle noises or smells around them. Adults, however, tend to be aware that they can potentially be serious. A strange smell might indicate anything from a fire to a gas leak to mold to vehicle problems, while strange sounds could indicate mechanical or electrical problems (in a building or vehicle), or any number of other dangers. Of course, such things could also be unimportant, but that's difficult to know until you've found the source, which can be difficult to do. As a result, adults may spend a lot more time thinking about such things than children would ever expect. \n|-\n| Pocket radio communicators\n| 75%\n| 100%\n| When [[Randall]] was growing up, the pocket radio communicators were mostly seen in spy fiction or science fiction, and children often dreamed of a day when such devices were available to them. In the 21st century, the ubiquity of {{w|cell phone}}s and other electronic devices means that having, carrying, and using such communicators is a nearly universal experience. \n|-\n| Bills\n| 90%\n| 100%\n| Most households have to contend with electricity, water and telecommunication service bills. Children will often hear their parents complaining about having to deal with bills, and will generally find out that this task is just as common as it was presented. \n|-\n| Digging {{w|pit trap}}s (title text)\n| N/A\n| N/A\n| Inside the Star Destroyer in [[1608: Hoverboard]] we see [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fd/1608_1055x1090y_Trap_covered_with_leaves_and_flying_Ponytail_at_bottom_of_hull.png Cueball cover a pit trap with leaves], so this is something Randall actually thinks about sometimes!\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Shown is a scatter plot, with arrowed labels on the axes:]\n:Y axis label: How often it comes up in my adult life\n:X axis label: How often I expected it to come up in my adult life\n\n:[First row of items (comes up very often, from least to most expected):]\n:Unexplained smells or noises; customer service; pocket radio communicators; bills; shopping\n:[Items row by row from the second row onwards:]\n:Figuring out what to have for dinner; HVAC issues; secret passwords; laundry; cooking; taxes\n:Weather forecasts; batteries; video games; power tools\n:Cable management; dangerous driving situations; pizza; Star Wars; lasers; cool toys\n:Adhesives; board games; tying knots\n:Water damage; backpacks; my academic record\n:Flat tires; briefcases; martial arts\n:Middle names; people offering free drugs; food fights; parachutes; twins switching places; barrels\n:[Last row (comes up very rarely, from least to most expected):]\n:Which fork you're supposed to use for what; car chases; lit fuses; shoving a stick in a crocodile's mouth to wedge it open; grappling hooks; quicksand\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Scatter plots]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Weather]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Board games]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Taxes]]"
