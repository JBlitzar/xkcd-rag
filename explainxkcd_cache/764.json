They get to write letters like that because when you're not getting a real science degree you have a lot of free time. Zing!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic parodies {{w|Sesame Street}}, an American children's TV show. The Count is a character in Sesame Street who teaches counting to viewers. The Count usually laughs after counting numbers, an innocent version of the sinister laugh that is a stereotype of old Hollywood horror films. \n\nIn the book {{w|One Two Three ... Infinity}}, the writer describes African tribes that only have words for numbers up to three and their inability to distinguish or comprehend larger numbers. The {{w|Pirah√£ language}} of Brazil was originally thought to only have numerical terms for one, two, and many, although it is now thought these words are relative terms like \"few\" rather than absolute terms like \"one.\" Similarly, see {{w|Edmund Blackadder}} try to teach {{tvtropes|BumblingSidekick|Baldrick}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u99LjJ32qOo to count beans]. Also worth mentioning, some {{w|Constructed language|conlangs}} (Most notably {{w|Toki Pona}} whose two primary systems are \"1, 2, many\" and \"1, 2, 5, 20, 100\" [https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Number_systems]), only have very limited number choice, while [https://sirterrypratchett.tumblr.com/post/159070715962/everyone-knows-trolls-cant-even-count-up-to/amp the Discworld's trolls] are less limited than their contemporaries imagine and may even be linguistically related to whoever is behind the comic's Count.\n\nIn the title text Randall predicts that anthropology majors will write to complain that this view of primitive tribes is a myth no longer held true by today's anthropologists. He makes a jab at them saying they would have time to write letters to complain about things because they don't have to spend time doing real science and thus real research.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A television set with The Count from 'Sesame Street'.]\n:The Count: One! Ah ah ah... Two! Ah ah ah... ...Many! ah ah ah...\n:Primitive cultures develop Sesame Street.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Language]]"
