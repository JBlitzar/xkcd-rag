Megan exemplifies this with how {{w|plural}} forms of {{w|nouns}} are created by sticking an \"s\" at the end, and {{w|past tense}} of a {{w|verb}} is done by the suffix \"ed\". Megan then explains that this works well in {{w|languages}} which build on {{w|alphabets}}.\n\nShe continues to explain that their {{w|Indo-European languages|language family}} belongs to those that are inflected, but the {{w|Modern English|English branch}} is becoming less inflected than it used to be. Specifically this explains why English does not have so many {{w|Latin conjugations}}. A conjugation is a pattern of inflections, describing how a particular group of verbs is altered from its root form to represent different grammatical cases. Only verbs have conjugations (are ''conjugated''), nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are described by declensions (and are ''declined''). All inflected languages can be described by conjugations and declensions, although Latin is one of the most commonly cited, perhaps because Latin grammar was taught for centuries by monotonous rote learning of the conjugations and declensions.\n\nA typical Latin conjugation would be the verb '''amare''', to love.\n\n{|\n!

'ametur'\n! ''he/she/it should be loved''\n!\n! 'amentur'\n! ''they should be loved''\n|-\n|\n|}\n(The English singular uses archaic forms to highlight the number and person.)  A complete conjugation includes all tenses (Present, Imperfect, Future, Perfect, Pluperfect, and Puture Perfect), both voices (Active & Passive), and all moods (Indicative, Imperative, Subjunctive). Other parts of speech ‚Äî infinitives, participles, gerunds, and so forth ‚Äî are needed to completely define the verb, but are not usually considered to be part of the conjugation.\n\nCueball then asks ''Could that mean that English writing might be ripe to become more pictographic?'' Instead of using traditional words, Megan replies with three {{w|emojis}} \"Thumbs up\" (like), \"Applause\", and a smiley ‚Äî thus showing a pictographic version of the writing which has become more popular in the last years. Emoji has become a [[:Category:Emoji|recurring theme]] on xkcd.\n\nThe writing systems of many languages have both {{w|pictographic}} and {{w|ideographic}} origins. \"Pictographic\" means that they are pictures of some thing that will remind the reader of either the pronunciation or the meaning of the word. The letter \"A\", for example, originated from a word meaning \"ox\", but was meant to remind readers of the glottal stop (it wasn't until the Ancient Greeks, who didn't have the glottal stop as a distinct phoneme, got a hold of the Phoenician version that it was transferred to the vowel(s) it is today). \"Ideographic\" means that they are designed, through pictures, to illustrate some idea. An example would be a \"No Smoking\" sign, where a red circle with a diagonal line is an abstract representation of \"no\". In fact, the three emojis used in the third panel of this cartoon are all ideographic, not pictographic, under this definition. \"Thumbs up\" (like), \"Applause\", and the smiley, are all emojis that remind us of a concept of approval.\n\n{{w|Egyptian hieroglyphics}} contain many pictorial elements, some of which are pictographic in the sense that they are meant to represent the thing that they picture, but many are more abstract (ideographic) or are used for their {{w|phonetic}} value (as \"A\" was used in early alphabetic systems). Similarly, in the {{w|Chinese character}} writing system, many of the elements have pictographic or ideographic origins; but they are often, and even usually combined in ways that are phonetic and not related to the pictures that were the origins of the characters.\n\nEarly modern English (think Shakespeare or the {{w|King_James_Version|KJV}} Bible) used more forms for the tenses than we do today, which can help illustrate the trend away from inflected forms. In contrast, verbs in English today are often conjugated with auxiliary verbs. See below for details on [[#Modern verb conjugation in English|modern verb conjugation in English]].\n\nThe title text points out that some intentional misspelling are used in Internet slang to alter the meaning of a word: \"what\" becomes \"[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wat wat]\" to [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wat express] confusion, disgust or disbelief. The title text also uses typographical variation to emphasize the word MORE by using all capital letters. Such emphasis is difficult to show with inflected language alone.\n\nThis comic is referenced at 4500 BCE in huge chart of [[1732: Earth Temperature Timeline]]. According to that comic it was at that time inflection was invented but just to tease future students so they have to remember a [[#Modern verb conjugation in English|zillion verb endings]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan, holding a hand up, are seen walking together from afar in silhouette.]\n:Megan: Inflected languages change words to add meaning, like \"-s\" for plurals or \"-ed\" for past tense.\n:Megan: Alphabets‚Äîwhere symbols stand for sound instead of words‚Äîwork well for them, since you can show the changes through spelling.\n\n:[Zoom in on the two as Megan turns her head back towards Cueball and spreads her arms out.]\n:Megan: Our language family is inflected, but the English branch has lost most of its inflection over the millennia. It's why we don't have all those Latin conjugations.\n\n:[Cueball speaks as they walk on and Megan replies with three orange-yellow emoji: Thumbs Up Sign pointing right, Clapping Hands Sign pointing up left with two times three small lines to indicate the clapping and Smiling Face With Blushing (red) Cheeks and Smiling Eyes. Below given the closest match possible as of the release of the comic.]\n:Cueball: Could that mean English writing is ripe to become more pictographic?\n:Megan: <font color=\"orange\">üëç üëè üòä</font>\n\n==Trivia==\n===Modern verb conjugation in English===\nIn the table below is a sample of a modern verb conjugation in English.\n\nIn all of these conjugations, the only inflections on the main verb \"walk\" are \"-s\", \"-ed\", and \"-ing\". The highly irregular helper verbs, \"be\" and \"have\", have somewhat more interesting inflections. And although this table shows only the third person, the first and second person would only introduce the helper verb \"am\" (as in \"I am walking\"); similarly, the table shows only the indicative mood, but the subjunctive and imperative moods would not introduce any additional words, and the conditional mood would only introduce the helper verb \"would\" (an inflection of the irregular helper verb \"will\") without any additional inflections on the main verb \"walk\". If instead we made this table in Spanish (for example), then there would be many more inflections on the main verb (12 in the third-person indicative alone, 45 including all persons and moods, if I didn't miscount).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Verb: Walk\n!Voice->\n!colspan=\"2\"|Active\n!colspan=\"2\"|Passive\n|-\n!Tense\n!Singular (he/she/it)\n!Plural (they)\n!Singular (he/she/it)\n!Plural (they)\n|-\n|Present\n|walks\n|walk\n|is walked\n|are walked\n|-\n|Present progressive\n|is walking\n|are walking\n|is being walked\n|are being walked\n|-\n|Present perfect\n|has walked\n|have walked\n|has been walked\n|have been walked\n|-\n|Present perfect progressive\n|has been walking\n|have been walking\n|has been being walked\n|have been being walked\n|-\n|Past\n|walked\n|walked\n|was walked\n|were walked\n|-\n|Past progressive\n|was walking\n|were walking\n|was being walked\n|were being walked\n|-\n|Past perfect\n|had walked\n|had walked\n|had been walked\n|had been walked\n|-\n|Past perfect progressive\n|had been walking\n|had been walking\n|had been being walked\n|had been being walked\n|-\n|Future\n|will walk\n|will walk\n|will be walked\n|will be walked\n|-\n|Future progressive\n|will be walking\n|will be walking\n|will be being walked\n|will be being walked\n|-\n|Future perfect\n|will have walked\n|will have walked\n|will have been walked\n|will have been walked\n|-\n|Future perfect progressive\n|will have been walking\n|will have been walking\n|will have been being walked\n|will have been being walked\n|-\n|Conditional\n|would walk\n|would walk\n|would be walked\n|would be walked\n|-\n|Conditional progressive\n|would be walking\n|would be walking\n|would be being walked\n|would be being walked\n|-\n|Conditional perfect\n|would have walked\n|would have walked\n|would have been walked\n|would have been walked\n|-\n|Conditional perfect progressive\n|would have been walking\n|would have been walking\n|would have been being walked\n|would have been being walked\n|}\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]"
