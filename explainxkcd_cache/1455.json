The general version is that an out of control trolley (or train) is heading towards 5 people on the track who can't get out of the way. On an alternative branch of the track is 1 person who can't get out of the way. The trolley can be diverted by using a lever, with the consequence of saving the 5 people but killing the 1 person. \n\nThe choice is between a deliberate action that will directly kill one person, or allowing events to unfold naturally, resulting in five deaths.  The question posed is whether or not it is morally right to pull the lever. The moral question is not as simple as it may first appear. \n\nThis results of [http://www.philosophyexperiments.com/fatman/Default4.aspx this test] report that around 86% of respondents choose the utilitarian option of diverting the trolley. \n\nThere are, however, several alternative formulations of the same basic dilemma. One such scenario allows you to stop the trolley by deliberately pushing \"a very fat man\" into its path, killing the man but saving the other five people. Another scenario involves selecting a healthy young and innocent person to die, in order to save five others going through organ donation. In both of these examples the basic dilemma is the same. However, most people reject the utilitarian option in these cases. \n\nAfter discovering a variation on this problem posed in a strip of the [http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3556#comic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal] webcomic (which can be seen on the tablet he is carrying), [[Rob|Cueball]], Black Hat's roommate, presents it to [[Black Hat]]. Before Cueball can finish explaining the problem, most notably leaving out the disadvantage to flipping the lever where it would kill one person, Black Hat questions whether he would need to get up to reach the lever and how much it would interrupt his other activities. As usual, he cares nothing at all about what happens to other people. This response is linked to another theory in philosophy, that of {{w|self interest}} or {{w|egoism}} or {{w|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism}}, in which a person will choose the action with the most benefit for them personally.\n\nBlack Hat then poses an offer: he promises to divert the trolley if Cueball is one of the five endangered people, provided that Cueball pays him $1 now. Again Black Hat is twisting the situation to his own benefit, in this case monetary. In the case of self-interest, the $1 could be the price at which Black Hat values his time and effort, below which he feels there is no benefit to himself in pulling the lever. Cueball decides that there is no point posing the problem to someone like Black Hat and gives up. This further shows that it is challenging for people with different ethical frameworks to function together without a common understanding, either mutually or with one side using that understanding to motivate a mutually agreeable or horrible solution.\n\nThe title text follows this up by continuing Black Hat's offers. For $5 he will not deliberately arrange this situation and for $25 he will quit looking for further incentives. These attempts to exploit the thought exercise for personal gain further demonstrate Black Hat's cynical amorality.\n\nBlack Hat's offer makes Cueball himself the subject of the trolley problem: Cueball now has a choice of expending $1 to save 5 people (including himself) while sacrificing one person, or $5 to save all 6 people. Of course, he could dismiss the offer as a joke, if not for the fact that the person making it, which, as we know from other comics, is very much capable of such exploits.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Ever heard of the trolley problem?\n:Black hat: No. What is it?\n\n:Cueball: A trolley is barreling towards five helpless people on the tracks. You can pull a lever to direct it onto another track, but-\n\n:Black hat: Can I reach the lever without getting up?\n:Cueball: Wait, I'm not-\n:Black hat: In this scenario, how busy am I?\n\n:Cueball: I guess I forgot who I was talking to.\n:Black hat: For a dollar, I'll promise to pull the lever if one of the five people is you.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Three years later two comics were released with about one month between them where the Trolley problem was mentioned. In [[1925: Self-Driving Car Milestones]] it is in the last ''milestone'' on the list and a month later, in [[1938: Meltdown and Spectre]], it is used as a metaphor for the way some computer programs work. It would subsequently come up again in [[2635: Superintelligent AIs]], [[2702: What If 2 Gift Guide]], and [[2818: Circuit Symbols]]. \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
