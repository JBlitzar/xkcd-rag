However, if that is true, she can't understand why it continues to be in her thoughts. This might feel frustrating for Megan. Two of her friends (both [[Cueball]]-like) notice that she is seemingly stuck in this existential question and have a short-term solution for her. One friend reaches for a {{w|Super Soaker}} 50, a powerful toy squirt gun, to shoot at [[Megan]] while she is having an {{w|existential crisis}}. (Megan uses this soaker later against Cueball in [[517: Marshmallow Gun]] and [[2334: Slide Trombone]], and in comic [[625: Collections]], she has another one of her crises.)\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|operant conditioning}} technique (a form of behavioral modification) commonly used with house cats. If they start scratching the furniture, many people spray them with a squirt bottle (since they hate water) to discourage that behavior (though it seldom works).  It may also allude to the idea of hitting a break key where a program is stuck in a logical loop.\n\nMegan has since this comic had existential crises both in [[1111: Premiere]] and in [[1822: Existential Bug Reports]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan sits on a chair for two panels without moving.]\n\n:[In the third panel, Megan has still not moved but makes the following comment to no one in particular.]\n:Megan: If the question of what it all means doesn't mean anything, why do I keep coming back to it? \n\n:[Two Cueball-like friends of Megan are talking to each other. One of them is standing behind the office chair in which the other friend is sitting, behind a desk with a computer. The standing friend starts to walk toward Megan. The sitting friend pulls a large yellow and green super soaker from a drawer.]\n:Standing friend: She's getting existential again.\n:Sitting friend: It's okay, I have a super soaker.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Randall]] himself uploaded the strip's fourth panel to {{w|Wikimedia Commons}} ([http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xkcd_philosophy.png here]) for use on {{w|xkcd|''xkcd's'' Wikipedia article}}. xkcd is licenced under [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/ this] {{w|Creative Commons license}}, which is incompatible with [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ this] CC license that Wikipedia uses, because the latter allows commercial use.
