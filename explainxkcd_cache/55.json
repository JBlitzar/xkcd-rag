The previous one was [[53: Hobby]], but the next comic, [[56: The Cure]], was never posted to LiveJournal. It was among the [[:Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com|last eleven comics]] posted both on LiveJournal and on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] after the new site was launched. This comic was published on the same day across both sites, but not all of them shared the same posting day.\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall Munroe|Randall]] is attempting to apply mathematics to the concept of love to no avail. Specifically, he is attempting his \"normal approach\", which is a term used in mathematics for the method one typically uses to solve a certain type of problem. However, as love is not a well-defined mathematical entity, his normal approach is useless. Simply put: he's saying he has found no way of describing love using only the tools of mathematics.\n\nFrom the top, moving left to right, he tries the {{w|square root}} of love, the {{w|cosine}} of love, and the {{w|derivative}} of love with respect to x. He then attempts to left-multiply love by a 2x2 {{w|identity matrix}}, and finally he defines a {{w|Function (mathematics)|function}} of love as a {{w|Fourier transform}}. These are all \"normal approaches\" to solving certain math problems. The message of the comic is that for someone who uses math to solve all their problems, defining love is impossible.  It also indicates that love is not always a rational (or irrational) phenomenon.\n\n===Basic explanations of the functions===\n* The {{w|square root}}s of x are the two numbers (positive and negative) where each multiplied by itself equals x. Often only the positive answer is quoted.\n* {{w|Cosine}} is a {{w|trigonometric function}} that, when given the measure of an angle in a {{w|right triangle}} as an input, outputs the ratio of the lengths of two sides of that triangle (for cosine, it is the non-{{w|hypotenuse}} side adjacent to the angle and the hypotenuse).\n* A {{w|derivative}} of a function is the rate of change of that function at a given value of x. It is a primary focus of {{w|calculus}}. A basic example is where \"velocity\" is the rate of change of displacement at a given time, the derivative of velocity is \"acceleration\", which is the rate of change of velocity at a given time. \n* {{w|identity matrix|Identity matrices}} are {{w|matrix (mathematics)|matrices}} that consist of only zeros and ones, with zeros everywhere except along the {{w|main diagonal}}. Multiplying a matrix by the equal-sized identity matrix will result in the same output in the same way that multiplying a non-matrix by 1 does not change the original term. The title text suggests that multiplying love by the identity matrix does not return the same \"love\" value.\n* A {{w|Fourier transform}} converts a function of time into a function of frequency. Therefore the original function is now represented as a \"sum\" of simpler periodic functions, that is sinusoidal waves. This is commonly used in math and science because these sinusoidal waves are easy to work with, for instance when solving certain partial differential equations like the heat equation. It is also used to study the relative amplitudes of the various sinusoids that form a signal, the spectrum of the signal, for instance when using a spectrum analyzer on an audio signal. Evidently the Fourier Transform of love is either not readily found or does not exist, which is unusual as even functions that are quite complicated or discontinuous can be represented in the Fourier domain.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Different mathematical equations, all with a heart on left side, and all ending up with question marks.]\n:√♥ = ?\n:cos ♥ = ?\n:d/dx ♥ = ?\n:<sub>[1 0]♥ = ?</sub>\n:<sup>[0 1]</sup>\n:F{♥} = 1/√2π ∫<sup>∞</sup><sub>-∞</sub>f(t)e<sup>it♥</sup>dt = ?\n:[Caption below the equations:]\n:My normal approach is useless here.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the book ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'', this comic is slightly different. The derivative is with respect to time (''t'') instead of ''x'', and the function at the bottom is a {{w|Laplace transform}} instead of the bottom integral.\n* Also in the book, a cipher is displayed prominently below the comic:\n\n<pre>\nCY-O CMLROOCXN.
