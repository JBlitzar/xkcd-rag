The most sinister result is the subsequent purchase of more buns, followed by more hot dogs, followed by more buns, over and over again until forty total hot dogs have been eaten (in a cycle similar to that shown in [[140: Delicious]]).\n\nThe actual reason for the mismatch between hot dogs and buns, according to both [http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/11/dont-hot-dogs-hot-dog-buns-come-packs-number-start/ Karl Smallwood] and [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/560/why-do-hot-dogs-come-10-to-a-pack-while-buns-are-8-to-a-pack Cecil Adams], is that meat packers like things that come in pounds and bakers hate things that come in tens. Nonetheless, some smaller companies are starting to offer bags of ten buns, and several brands of hot dogs sell in packages of eight.\n\nHere, [[Cueball]] attempts to raise the question as he is standing with a package of {{w|hot dogs}} in one hand and a bag of {{w|Hot dog bun|buns}} in the other hand (presumably for their dinner), but a person offscreen interrupts him mid sentence and mentions {{w|condoms}} instead of buns. Cueball mulls the subject over in his mind, and when he realizes his friend is putting hot dogs in condoms, he is promptly grossed out.\n\nThe title text makes it clear that Cueball's new found association of [http://www.snopes.com/college/risque/hotdog.asp hot dogs with sexual activity], has put him totally off the idea of eating any of them this evening, and he suggests ordering {{w|pizza}}, which he then can hope will not be used for this similar ('''{{w|Not safe for work|NSFW}}''') [http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a5943/pizza-sex-tip/ comparisons]â€¦ Cueball also asks that he and his friend never discuss this conversation again, due to the situation's awkwardness and uncomfortable subject matter.\n\nThe style of the conversation with Cueball asking, someone answering and Cueball saying ''Eww'' is similar to a situation in the game comic [[1608: Hoverboard]] where a [[Media:1608_1078x1095y_Ant_Queen_in_Destroyer.png|giant ant queen]] inside the Destroyer is provoking Cueball in the same way by talking about laying eggs like this:\n:Cueball: What's up?\n:Ant queen: The usual. Poopin' out ants.\n:Cueball: Eww.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in the frame holding a bag and a package of hot dogs.]\n:Cueball: Hey, why do hot dogs come in packages of ten-\n:Offscreen: -But condoms come in strips of six? I know, right?!\n:Cueball: ...Eww.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
