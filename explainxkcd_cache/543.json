You're the best. <3\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nA {{w|Valentine's Day}} card from [[Randall]] to the xkcd readers. It is written inside a parody of the {{w|Sierpinski Triangle}}, a Sierpinski Valentine.\n \n[[File:SierpinskiTriangle.jpg|frame|A Sierpinski triangle.]]\nThe {{w|Sierpinski Triangle}} is a fractal pattern made of triangles, covering a space. The way it works is to draw a triangle and draw another (upside down) one in the middle. Choose the upper, left and right triangle and repeat the process. Another valentine in the shape of a heart is [[63: Valentine - Heart]].\n\nThe <3 in the title text is an {{w|emoticon}} for a heart and goes out to those of his readers that read the title text. Those who read it are usually more devoted to knowing that such a thing exists.\n\nAnother relevant comic to the Sierpinski Triangle is [[95: The Sierpinski Penis Game]].\n\nA \"circular version\", in a form known as an Apollonian Gasket, can be seen at [[17: What If]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Shows an adaptation of the Sierpinski triangle fractal, using hearts instead of triangles.]\n:Happy valentine's day.\n::-xkcd\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Valentines]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
