Don't Tell Me}}'' is an hour-long weekly radio news panel game show produced by {{w|Chicago Public Radio}} and {{w|National Public Radio}}. The show is hosted by {{w|playwright}} and actor {{w|Peter Sagal}}. Each episode ends with the panelists making up a potential future news story, usually with implausible \"facts\". This comic is making puns on the title of the show based on what Peter Sagal might have done that was newsworthy.\n\n{{w|Carl Kasell}}, who also served as the news anchor on {{w|Morning Edition}}, was the show's official judge and scorekeeper until May 2014 (after this comic was published), when he retired and was replaced by Bill Kurtis.\n\nThe 1st row, 3rd paper mocks classic celebrity scandal articles. This example uses {{w|Peter Sagal}} confessing his feelings towards {{w|Kermit the Frog}}\n\nThe 1st row, 4th paper may refer to the {{w|Michael_Richards#2006–2012:_Laugh_Factory_incident_and_aftermath| Laugh Factory Incident}} of 2006.\n\nIn the 3rd row, first paper, {{w|Lakshmi Singh}} is NPR's national midday newscaster.  This paper leads to the second paper on the third row, in which Sagal's wife divorces him over his affair with Singh.\n\nIn the 3rd row, 3rd paper is a reference to a protest at {{w|UC Davis}} (on the campus of University of California, Davis) protests in early 2012 in which sitting, peaceful protesters were calmly pepper-sprayed in their faces by a police officer. That spawned an [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/casually-pepper-spray-everything-cop internet meme of epic proportions].\n\nIn the 4th row, 2nd paper is a reference to the movie, ''{{w|Ghostbusters}}''.\n\nIn the 4th row, 3rd paper is a reference to {{w|Granny Weatherwax}} of Terry Pratchett's ''{{w|Discworld}}'' novels; Granny Weatherwax is a witch who carries a sign saying \"[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20aten't%20ded I ATEN'T DED]\"(sic) when having out-of-body experiences.\n\nIn the 5th row, 2nd paper is a reference to another internet meme in where someone leaves out the verb in the sentence. The implication is that the verb is something bad, but ''which'' bad thing is left as an exercise to stew in the reader's mind. See the [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-accidentally I Accidentally ___ meme] for more information.\n\nIn the 5th row, 3rd paper is a reference to stories and myths in which an entity can be summoned, awoken, or alerted to someone's presence when its name is spoken. A well-known example of this is the entity Cthulhu in the Lovecraft mythos.\n\nTwo years later another New Years comic, [[1311: 2014]], took a similar look at what could happen in 2014, just as this does for 2012. Interesting enough the title of that comic (just the year it was looking at) is more related to the title of the next comic after this one, which is also a New Year comic, and the title is also just the number of the year: [[998: 2012]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:Headlines\n:Stockpiled in case Peter Sagal, host of NPR's ''Wait Wait Don't Tell Me'', does something newsworthy in 2012.\n:[A series of above-the-fold newspapers follows.
