Don't Tell Me}}'' is an hour-long weekly radio news panel game show produced by {{w|Chicago Public Radio}} and {{w|National Public Radio}}. The show is hosted by {{w|playwright}} and actor {{w|Peter Sagal}}. Each episode ends with the panelists making up a potential future news story, usually with implausible \"facts\". This comic is making puns on the title of the show based on what Peter Sagal might have done that was newsworthy.\n\n{{w|Carl Kasell}}, who also served as the news anchor on {{w|Morning Edition}}, was the show's official judge and scorekeeper until May 2014 (after this comic was published), when he retired and was replaced by Bill Kurtis.\n\nThe 1st row, 4th paper may refer to the {{w|Michael_Richards#2006_Laugh_Factory_incident| Laugh Factory Incident}} of 2006.\n\nIn the 3rd row, first paper, {{w|Lakshmi Singh}} is NPR's national midday newscaster.  This paper leads to the second paper on the third row, in which Sagal's wife divorces him over his affair with Singh.\n\nIn the 3rd row, 3rd paper is a reference to a protest at {{w|UC Davis}} (on the campus of University of California, Davis) protests in early 2012 in which sitting, peaceful protesters were calmly pepper-sprayed in their faces by a police officer. That spawned an [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/casually-pepper-spray-everything-cop internet meme of epic proportions].\n\nIn the 4th row, 2nd paper is a reference to the movie, ''{{w|Ghostbusters}}''.\n\nIn the 4th row, 3rd paper is a reference to {{w|Granny Weatherwax}} of Terry Pratchett's ''{{w|Discworld}}'' novels; Granny Weatherwax is a witch who carries a sign saying \"[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20aten't%20ded I ATEN'T DED]\"(sic) when having out-of-body experiences.\n\nIn the 5th row, 2nd paper is a reference to another internet meme in where someone leaves out the verb in the sentence. The implication is that the verb is something bad, but ''which'' bad thing is left as an exercise to stew in the reader's mind. See the [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-accidentally I Accidentally ___ meme] for more information.\n\nIn the 5th row, 3rd paper is a reference to stories and myths in which an entity can be summoned, awoken, or alerted to someone's presence when its name is spoken. A well-known example of this is the entity Cthulhu in the Lovecraft mythos.\n\nTwo years later another New Years comic, [[1311: 2014]], took a similar look at what could happen in 2014, just as this does for 2012. Interesting enough the title of that comic (just the year it was looking at) is more related to the title of the next comic after this one, which is also a New Year comic, and the title is also just the number of the year: [[998: 2012]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:Headlines\n\n:Stockpiled in case Peter Sagal, host of NPR's ''Wait Wait Don't Tell Me'', does something newsworthy in 2012.\n\n:[Series of above-the-fold newspapers follows; Each has a headline, picture in most of them, and an explanation.]\n\n:[First row, first paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Shoot Me\n:[A fierce Peter Sagal in a balaclava brandishes a gun in a supermarket.]\n:NPR's Sagal in Whole Foods hostage standoff.\n\n:[First row, second paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Vote For Me\n:Peter Sagal quits race for GOP top spot\n:[A sullen and defeated Peter Sagal surrounded by supporters admits defeat.]\n\n:[First row, third paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Judge Me\n:Sagal opens up about his Kermit fantasy.\n:[Stock profile images of Peter Sagal and Kermit the Frog.]\n\n:[First row, fourth paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Fire Me\n:[Stock profile image of Peter Sagal.]\n:Peter Sagal let go after racist tirade.\n\n:[Second row, first paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Cancel Me\n:NPR axing news quiz.\n:[NPR spokesperson delivering announcement.]\n\n:[Second row, second paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Interrupt Me\n:Sagal stabs Carl Kasell in on-air dispute.\n:[Peter Sagal mid-attack with a knife.]\n\n:[Second row, third paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Look At Me\n:[Peter Sagal with a skin condition.]\n:Peter Sagal's Poison Ivy Ordeal\n:Peter Sagal: \"My 'Nam\"\n\n:[Second row, fourth paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Friend Me\n:Peter Sagal deletes his Facebook account.\n:[Person holding up a laptop with an \"Facebook account not found\" screen.]\n\n:[Third row, first paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Seduce Me\n:How Lakshmi Singh stole Sagal's Heart.\n:[A wistful Lakshmi Singh being left by a sullen Peter Sagal.]\n\n:[Third row, second paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Leave Me\n:[A wistful Peter Sagal being left by a furious Beth Sagal.]\n:Sagal's wife out after affair\n\n:[Third row, third paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Spray Me\n:Police Raid Sagal's Occupy NPR protest\n:[Scummy policeman in riot gear spraying Peter Sagal in the face point blank.]\n\n:[Third row, fourth paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Indict Me\n:Sagal, five others named in cash-for-tote-bags scandal \n:[Peter Sagal doing a perp walk.]\n\n:[Fourth row, first paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Clone Me\n:Peter Sagal 'Outraged' over DNA harvesting.\n:[Fiery Peter Sagal, missing a small amount of DNA, at a lectern.]\n\n:[Fourth row, second paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Bust Me\n:Peter Sagal's ghost captured\n:[Ghostbusters, careful not to cross the streams, capture the ghost of Peter Sagal.]\n\n:[Fourth row, third paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Dissect Me\n:Snoozing Sagal nearly snuffed in autopsy snafu\n:[Peter Sagal running away from from a very surprised pathologist.]\n:Peter Sagal: \"I aten't dead\"\n\n:[Fourth row, fourth  paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Objectify Me\n:Peter Sagal is more than just a piece of meat\n\n:[Fifth row, first paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Beatify Me\n:[Peter Sagal shakes his fist at a picture of the pope.]\n:Peter Sagal Rebukes Pope\n\n:[Fifth row, second paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Me\n:Peter Sagal Accidentally\n:[Peter Sagal on a blank background upside-down.]\n\n:[Fifth row, third  paper.]\n:Wait Wait Don't Speak Its Name\n:[eyes...
