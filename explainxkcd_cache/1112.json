When one player can capture their opponent's king on their next move, and the opponent has no legal move available to avoid such capture, the opponent is said to be in \"checkmate\", and by definition immediately loses.\n\nThe game, with origins around the sixth century and the modern rules being essentially set in the late 15th century, has a significant amount of history. The rules and traditions are well established. The knight is a piece that can only move in an L-shaped pattern (two squares in one direction, and one square perpendicular), but has the unique ability to jump over other pieces.\n\nThe comic highlights two mistakes players often make in chess: complete fixation on the king at the cost of their other pieces, and failure to take advantage of the knight's movement patterns. At the same time, this is a jab at how people sometimes oversimplify an argument when confronted with a topic they are not familiar with. Previously this was depicted in [[675: Revolutionary]] and [[793: Physicists]]. See also the {{w|Dunning–Kruger effect}}. The units in chess are widely agreed to be well-balanced, and [[Cueball|Cueball's]] criticism of the knight shows an obvious lack of knowledge of the knight's potential.\n\nGiven the long history of chess, a significant amount of writing and research has been dedicated to the game and its strategies. This is inadvertently mocked by Cueball who naively suggests it would be trivial to list all situations in which a piece would move backwards (called a \"retreat\" in chess). Such a list — at least a partial one — certainly does exist, as do lists of numerous other chess moves and situations.\n\n[[Knit Cap]] proceeds to demonstrate Cueball's lack of knowledge by beating him in four moves, which typically would only occur when an experienced player plays a novice. The checkmate depicted is the {{w|Scholar's mate|scholar's mate}}, being a classic early-game checkmate in chess. It is extremely easy to defend against it (blocking the queen's vision of f7, without letting the queen take any of your pieces, would do), thus proving Cueball's inexperience. Scrutiny of the board suggests a scholar's mate, something along these lines (using chess algebraic notation): 1.e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Qh5 Nf6 4. Qxf7#.\n\nCueball, instead of admitting he underestimated the game, believes the failure is in the game itself. The title text indicates that Cueball attempted to suggest revisions to the rules of chess. Given that Cueball has no experience as a chess player, it is likely many of the changes are illogical or ridiculous. In the face of hundreds of years of history, it is not surprising that the chess community is ignoring them. The last major changes to the rules of chess occurred more than 400 years ago when, among other things, the pawn was given its two-space starting move and the queen was made into the most powerful piece (previously it was the weakest). The chess community's ties to the traditions of the game and their refusal to accept Cueball's suggestions are written off by Cueball as \"{{w|emotional bias}}\" suggesting his changes are logical, but that the community is letting their emotions cloud their rational decision making abilities, while in reality, it is he who is being affected. However, Cueball may feel better if he learns that lots of {{w|Chess variants|chess variants}} do exist out there.\n\nThe comic may also be a jab at competitive online games whose fans call for \"buffs\" (power additions) and \"nerfs\" (power reductions) to characters they believe to be underpowered or overpowered, often with inadequate knowledge of those characters. On the other hand, some online games and multiplayer computer games in general are unbalanced since they lack centuries of history to balance themselves, unlike chess.\n\n[[Knit Cap]] is called ''knit hat guy'' in the [http://xkcd.com/1112/info.0.json official transcript]. There are two other cases (after this comic) where a person with hair has been shown with a knit cap. The first was [[Randall|Randall's]] wife after chemotherapy in [[1141: Two Years]] and the second time it was [[1350:_Lorenz#Knit_Cap|Knit Cap]] in [[1350: Lorenz]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Knit Cap is sitting down at a computer touching the keyboard with one hand.

The goal is checkmate, so you should always move pieces ''toward'' the other player's king.\n\n:[Closeup of Cueball holding a hand to his chin.]\n:Cueball: I guess occasionally you need to move backward, but it'd be trivial to make a list of those circumstances and-\n\n:[Knit Cap is leaning back in chair facing Cueball, panel is so slim that the lap top is not included.]\n:Knit Cap: Have you ever ''played'' chess?\n:Cueball: Not much, but—\n:Knit Cap: Wanna?\n:Cueball: Uh, ok.\n\n:[Knit Cap sitting and Cueball standing is playing chess with a board standing between them on a very small table or a four legged stool. The board extends quite far out on either side. Their moves are indicated above with four by Knit Cap and three towards Cueball.
