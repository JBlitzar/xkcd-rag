Essentially, [[Randall]] seems to be graphically stating that people who claim to hate and want to avoid drama are invariably associated with it. Since [[552: Correlation|correlation does not imply causation]], it might be a leap — at least scientifically speaking — to actually surmise that they're the cause of it. The fact that merely postulating a rule without telling if the creator of the rule is causing or avoiding drama didn't cause much drama in this wiki might be a (albeit weak) clue that the claim might actually be correct.   \n\nThe title text suggests that the person's attitude towards drama is wrong. Supposing that \"'Drama' is just 'people being upset'\", then ignoring drama is a very bad way to deal with it. By ignoring people's problems, you certainly won't be able to help them, and are at risk of causing further problems through ignorance.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Cartesian graph labeled 'How often someone declares that they hate \"drama\" and always avoid it' on the x-axis and 'Rate at which they create drama' labeled on the y-axis.
