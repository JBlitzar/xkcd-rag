It's pretty sad to hear about million-dollar research teams who can't even manage that.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic (and the title text) is based on a misunderstanding. The {{w|null hypothesis}} is the hypothesis in a statistical analysis that indicates that the effect investigated by the analysis does ''not'' occur, i.e. 'null' as in zero effect. For example, the null hypothesis for a study about cell phones and cancer risk might be \"Cell phones have no effect on cancer risk.\" The ''alternative hypothesis,'' by contrast, is the one under investigation - in this case, probably \"Cell phones affect the risk of cancer.\"\n\nAfter conducting a study, we can then make a judgment based on our data. There are statistical models for measuring the probability that a certain result occurred by random chance, even though in reality there is no correlation. If this probability is low enough (usually meaning it's below a certain threshold we set when we design the experiment, such as 5% or 1%), we ''reject'' the null hypothesis, in this case saying that cell phones ''do'' increase cancer risk. Otherwise, we ''fail to reject'' the null hypothesis, as we have insufficient evidence to conclusively state that cell phones increase cancer risk. This is how almost all scientific experiments, from high school biology classes to CERN, draw their conclusions.\n\nThe null hypothesis is thus a specific statement relative to the current study. In the comic, Cueball apparently misunderstands this. Recalling a study that disproved the null hypothesis relative to that study, Cueball believes that \"''the'' null hypothesis\" has been disproven, and wonders why the concept is still taught in school, especially given that, as the title text says, his eighth grade class \"conclusively rejected it just using a classroom experiment\". \n\n==Transcript==\n:[A student works at a desk, and Cueball is talking to Megan.]\n:Cueball: I can't believe schools are still teaching kids about the null hypothesis.\n:Cueball: I remember reading a big study that conclusively disproved it ''years'' ago.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
