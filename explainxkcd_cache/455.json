Black Hat is not a person to be trifled with, but from his reaction, he apparently believes that Two Black Hats represents a considerable danger to him. Black Hat knows how dangerous he is to those with one fewer black hat than him, so he continues the logic and realizes that one who has one ''more'' black hat must be proportionally dangerous to him.\n\nIf a black hat is assumed to be akin to a badge of rank, then Two Black Hats certainly is superior to him in the capacity and willingness to do evil. Alternatively, and even more worrying, Two Black Hats could be someone who has the desire and the ability to acquire black hats (possibly killing the previous owners in the process if having two black hats really means that the individual is more malevolent than Black Hat), which he then wears like a badge of honor. With all this in mind, Black Hat edges away, keeping Two Black Hats in sight at all times. This movement and the accompanying line could also be interpreted as Black Hat being physically pushed away, like two negative or two positive poles of a magnet, although this does not explain why it only starts after a beat panel.\n\nAnother interpretation is that the left figure (perhaps nominally a [[Cueball]] character) has had the audacity or thoughtlessness to obtain a black hat, for whatever reason. Black Hat learns of this and responds by ''similarly'' adding to his normal apparel, just to make a non-verbal point that could be a passive-aggressive sign of displeasure or merely from his usual wry sense of amusement.\n\nThis comic is also a metatextual joke about xkcd itself. Because of the comic's simplistic art style and characterization, Black Hat has only two defining physical traits: his hat and his hair, which we see when he takes off his hat, and one defining personality trait, his malevolence. Randall then implies that the two traits must be correlated, so that a black hat signifies malevolence, and accordingly two hats must signify even more malevolence -- an idea that wouldn't make any sense in real life, where a person with two hats would just be making an odd fashion choice.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text is simply \"...\" This may represent the slow-motion pause during which Black Hat's nefarious life flashes before his eyes, as he considers his impending doom. It may also emphasize how the usually witty Black Hat is, for once, speechless. Or the title text is similar to that in [[412: Startled]], where Black Hat also becomes the little one (and with much focus on the black hat, as in this comic). As mentioned there, such a short title text could be due to the fact that it's a somewhat surreal comic, and any further commentary might have detrimentally brought it down to Earth. See also [[82: Frame]], with the same title text, but no relation to black hats, and [[1190: Time]], which had that title-text for a while but no longer does and also has no relation to black hats.\n\nTwo Black Hats makes a reappearance in [[826: Guest Week: Zach Weiner (SMBC)]], down by the restrooms.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is walking.]\n\n:[Black Hat stops in front of another man with two Black Hats, the uppermost hat tilted about 45 degrees back.]\n\n:[After two panels, the original Black Hat steps backward, quivering slightly.]\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]"
