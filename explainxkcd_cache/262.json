Black Hat claims to be from the Internet and is thus creating LOLcat memes by literally gluing captions to Cueball's cats.\n\nThe title text suggests that Black Hat is using glue only because he ran out of staples; fortunately for the cats in the picture, glue is much less painful than a staple.{{cn}} The title text suggests that Black Hat was stapling captions to cats earlier. This either means that Black Hat has injured some of Cueball's cats, just not the ones on screen (which would imply that Cueball has very many cats, since Black Hat would have brought a fair number of staples to begin with) or that Black Hat injured other people's cats before going to Cueball's house in order to caption the cats there. The title is also a reference to the \"I'm in ur base killing ur d00dz\" [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/in-ur-base catchphrase] from real-time-strategy games.\n\nStapling things to other things has also been referenced in [[291: Dignified]] and [[478: The Staple Madness]]. Being \"from the Internet\" was spoken of in the title text of [[256: Online Communities]]. This comic is seemingly referenced in [[526: Converting to Metric]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is holding a cat and a piece of paper. Cueball has raised his arms. There are three cats with captions stuck to them. One cat may be trying to remove the caption from itself, or toying with it playfully, as it rolls around on its back and makes noises.]\n:Black Hat: Oh hi; I'm here from the Internet.\n:Cueball: What are you doing!?\n:Black Hat: Gluing captions to your cats.\n:Cat: <small>''RRRR''</small>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Cats]]"
