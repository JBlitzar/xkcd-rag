Most people have a few hundred (or thousand) \"friends\" on Facebook, most of whom do not have enough influence to cause bad events on a national or global level.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text refers to people venting. The humorous assumption here is that one will feel better after doing so. While some amount of venting might help to relieve stress caused by bad events, alienating people you know by blaming them for bad events usually causes more stress in the long run.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands.]\n:Cueball (thinking): I feel sad.\n:Cueball (thinking): Bad things are happening.\n\n:[Cueball still stands.]\n:Cueball (thinking): They must be someone's fault.\n:Cueball (thinking): But whose?\n\n:[Cueball makes several thinking poses before a light bulb appears over his head.]\n\n:[Close-up of Cueball's head.]\n:Cueball (thinking): ''My friends on Facebook.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]"
