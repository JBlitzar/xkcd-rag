The eww refers to the fact that the brown-eyed girl turns into a brown-thighed girl, and such colored thighs could be eminently possible via an act of poor defecation on oneself, hence the disgust reaction from Megan.\n\nIn the title text, it seems that Cueball continues with a reference to the first line of {{w|The Battle Hymn of the Republic}}, adding to the humorous effect, since typically thighs cannot see. But mainly it is a sexual joke playing on the double meaning of \"{{w|Ejaculation|coming}}\".\n\nIn [[1814: Color Pattern]], [[Randall]] makes his own version of \"That's Amore,\" this time letting Megan sing it to Cueball.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is singing into a microphone he is holding while Megan sit in her office chair typing on her computer. Musical notes fly around Cueball.]\n:Cueball: It's the thigh of the tiger\n\n:[Cueball continues to sing, titling his head upwards.]\n:Cueball: When the moon hits your thigh like a big pizza pie, that's amore.\n\n:[Cueball sings on now holding the microphone in both hands.]\n:Cueball: She's my brown-thighed girl.\n:Megan: Don't you have a job or something?\n:Megan: Also, Eww.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Sex]] <!--title text -->"
