Although the summer solstice is the longest day of the year for that hemisphere, the dates of the earliest sunrise and latest sunset differ by a few days. This is because of two different effects. First, Earth's axial tilt means that at some points in the year, the Earth is slightly ahead in its total rotation, whereas at other parts it is behind. Second, Earth orbits the Sun in an ellipse, and its orbital speed varies slightly during the year. These two effects combine to give the {{w|Equation of time}}, which relates variable solar time to steady clock time. The two have competing effects near the summer solstice, with the axial tilt making the days later and the orbit making days earlier. The axial tilt is the faster changing of the two at the summer solstice, so it wins out, meaning that sunsets are still getting later for a few days after the solstice, despite the days getting shorter. White Hat, a layman not aware of this correction, assumed that the latest sunset would occur on the summer solstice.\n\nSimilarly, the earliest sunrise already happened before the solstice. This is given since the day (time the Sun is over the horizon) was longest on the solstice. Still, the Sun will set later for the next six days, meaning that during those six days, the Sun will rise later than previous days by an even greater margin to make the days get shorter after the solstice.\n\nThe caption says that [[Randall]] is working on a giant machine capable of adjusting the Earth's orbit. Once finished, the first thing he will use it for is to fix this discrepancy, so the longest day will also have the latest sunset and earliest sunrise. This could be accomplished by either making Earth's orbit circular and removing the axial tilt (which would eliminate the solstices), or trying to balance the {{w|orbital eccentricity}} with the axial tilt, making the solstices match the days of closest or furthest distance from the Sun (perihelion or aphelion). This \"fix\" would avoid confusing people like White Hat.\n\nThe title text discusses his next plans for increasing the number of {{w|solar eclipses}} from 0-1 each year to one each month. Solar eclipses occur when the {{w|Moon}} is directly between the Sun and Earth. Because of the tilt of the Moon's orbit to the {{w|ecliptic}} (the plane of the Earth's orbit, as ''sort of'' depicted in [[1878: Earth Orbital Diagram]]), most of the time when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth they're not in direct alignment, so the Moon's shadow misses the Earth and we don't get an eclipse. Randall's engine will shift the Moon's orbit so it's not tilted so far and we get eclipses every month. But if it were exactly aligned with the ecliptic, eclipses would always be near the equator, so he'll leave a little wobbling so other areas will get eclipses too.  Randall thinks solar eclipses are extremely cool, as noted in [[1880: Eclipse Review]], and would prefer that some of the eclipses be visible from where he lives. He just had one six years ago ([[:Category:Total Solar Eclipse 2017|2017]]), and just got another ([[1928: Seven Years|2024]]), but after that there will not be any eclipses over mainland USA for many years.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, Megan and White Hat are standing.
