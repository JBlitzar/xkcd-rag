Do you want to get a drink after the game?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is a joke parodying wedding ceremonies and {{w|American Football}} plays intended to misdirect or fool the opponents about what is really happening.\n\nA standard misdirection play involves the offense misdirecting the defense into thinking that the play being executed is actually a different play: for example, a {{w|American_football_positions|passing play}} could actually be a running play, or that a ball being run left is actually being run right, or that a {{w|field goal}} or {{w|Punt_(gridiron_football)|punt}} end up being attempted to get a {{w|Down_(gridiron_football)|down}}.\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] is about to get married to Amy, a girl looking like [[Megan]], but the bride interrupts the ritual by saying that she doesn't want to get married. The bride then reveals herself to be a Cueball-like man and after questioning reveals that the relationship and the wedding was an elaborate con to get the advantage on the football field. \"Amy\" turns out to be a player for the opposing team and he had a football on his person. He then proceeds to run the ball in for a touchdown. This clearly constitutes the ''greatest high school football misdirection play of all time''. {{cn}}\n\n[[Randall]] takes the deception in a misdirection play to the next, virtually impossible level; it is unlikely that a relationship could develop to the point of marriage within the time-frame of a football game, with \"the groom\" not noticing that Amy was in fact a football player, or that he was standing on the football field.\n\nThe title text indicates that, in spite of the deception, \"the groom\" still has feelings and is not ready to give up the relationship (or at least he would like to share a beer with the opposing team like after a friendly game). Alternatively, as it is unclear who is speaking, \"the bride\" may have also developed feelings for \"the groom\" and is now awkwardly asking for a date after deceiving \"the groom.\"\n\n===Misdirection Plays===\nOccasionally, especially at the high school level, extreme misdirection plays are attempted where teams try to misdirect the opposing team into thinking that a play is not even being run. Good examples of that can be found on YouTube, such as this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkA3nxuMJoM \"wrong ball\" trick], or that [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIdI8khMkw \"five more yards\" trick]. Despite conforming to the rules of the game, these are considered to be dirty tricks and usually only work in little league football.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A bride in full wedding dress, that looks like Megan, and Cueball with a bow-tie as the groom stand next to each other. Each has a hand outstretched toward the other.]\n:Officiator (off panel): Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?\n:Bride ('Amy'): ...No.\n\n:[Cueball steps back in surprise. The bride removes a wig to reveal that she is in fact a Cueball-like man.]\n:Groom: ''What? Amy!?''\n:Man: I'm not Amy. None of this was real. You're back in senior year. It's the big game.\n\n:[Cueball puts his hands to his head in confusion. The man holds up an American football, still holding the wig in his other hand.]\n:Cueball: What ''is'' this!?\n:Man: ''The greatest high school football misdirection play of all time.''\n\n:[Cueball puts his hands to his mouth as the man in the wedding dress begins to run backwards, away from him holding up the ball.]\n\n:[Cueball remains frozen in horror as the man turns and dashes toward the goalpost in the distance.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Wedding]]\n[[Category:American football]]"
