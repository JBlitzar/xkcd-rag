The world can be described as sad, as well as it can be described as wonderful, even if this seems a bit contradictory, just because it is so big and there are so many different things happening in it all at once. [[Cueball]] comments about this while hanging from a balloon, which brings to mind the expanded perspective over the landscape attained by early experimenters in overland flight.\n\nThe title text is the same as the comic title, and both of these invite the reader to ''Click and drag'' the inside of the last panel, with their mouse, and by dragging, explore what is hidden outside that panel. The image displayed at first turns out to be part of a huge landscape, filled with big or small things, humorous details, people here and there, cave mazes, things floating in the air, jokes and references, unexpected things, relaxing views, etc.\n\nThe fact that we only see a small part of the landscape at once refers to the idea that we cannot in real life comprehend the whole world altogether, but only what is around us and/or in the range of our understanding at the time. The click-and-drag process, in which it is impossible to go as fast as we would want to, also draws a parallel with the fact that exploration is always done gradually, step by step, and trying something (i.e. here dragging in a certain direction) always has a cost. This click-and-drag exploration reproduces the thrill of discovering new horizons, getting lost sometimes, finding unexpected things, seeing beauty, humor, desolation or happiness here and there... which can easily captivate an xkcd reader for a long time (and as such qualifies as [[356: Nerd Sniping|nerd sniping]]).\n\nIn comic [[1416: Pixels]] you zoom, by scrolling, until every pixel in this image turns into new pictures, and this can be continued again and again. Once you have zoomed in, you are able to ''click and drag'' the picture just like in this comic.\n\nAnd in [[1608: Hoverboard]] exactly the same idea is used again, but instead of dragging the image you fly/float around in the image with Cueball on a {{w|hoverboard}}. This gives a very different way to explore as he cannot go through walls or the earth etc. You also have to discover that there is a big world outside the initial play area; and where this comic tried to help people realize they should do something, both with the title and title text, Hoverboard directly tries to dissuade people from going outside with a warning message. Another major difference is that hoverboard is actually a game where you can collect coins (spread throughout the picture) and return them to the starting point to gain a score.\n\nThe book ''[[Thing Explainer]]'' that was the reason for the Hoverboard game, also has a direct reference to this comic, as Cueball is seen floating with his balloon outside the cockpit in the explanation for ''Stuff you touch to fly a sky boat''. [[1975: Right Click]], the April Fools' day comic of 2018, has a title similar to this one, in that it gives away how the user should begin to interact with the comic.\n{{spoiler|The best way to enjoy this comic is to {{xkcd|1110|play the game}} and explore the comic's world the way you're supposed to, get lost in the caves or in the sky, be startled by unexpected things or happy when finding some people after lengthy click-and-dragging through a repetitive landscape. If you didn't do that already, reading anything below will spoil you from truly enjoying the comic.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[This transcript only covers the first four panels as they are shown here above (i.e. before you click and drag).]\n\n:[Cueball is narrating the story, all the text is written in boxes above and below him without speech lines connecting to him.]\n:[Cueball is floating by holding onto a balloon with one hand.]\n:From the stories\n:I expected the world to be sad\n:And it was\n\n:[Cueball has grabbed hold of the balloon with both hands.]\n:And I expected it to be wonderful.\n\n:[The wind picks up and blows Cueball to the right.]\n:It was.\n\n:[Full width panel where the scene opens up. You see Cueball is about a tree's-height from the ground. To the right there is a tall tree with no leaves on it and a broken limb. Below him are some rocks and grass. This is the initial view of the world, that can be clicked and dragged. It is part of tile named 1 North 1 East.]\n:I just didn't expect it to be so ''big''.\n\n:'''[The rest of the comic is transcribed in the [[#Explanation of details and references|Explanation of details and references]] section below.]'''\n\n==Trivia==\n*The click-and-drag portion of this comic is divided up into 2592 sections of 2048x2048 pixels.\n*There are 225 separate 2048x2048 PNG files (plus the PNG container with the first panels). The other 2337 sections are simply filled black (in the south) or white (in the north) with HTML.\n*The populated area is 81 frames wide (33 West - 48 East) and 32 frames tall (13 North - 19 South)\n*According to [[Randall]] in #xkcd on the night this was released, a full size image of this comic (leaving out the blanks) would be 60 gigapixels, and a true single rectangular image would be close to a terapixel. The online version is 1 gigapixel without the blanks and 10 gigapixel as rectangular image (2048x2048x225 = 943,718,400 and 2048x2048x2592 = 10,871,635,968).\n*Based on the height of figures as well as the \"two mile\" figure given on the left-hand side, the scale should be approximately 32 pixels per 5 feet, making the entire map 25920 feet wide (4.9 miles or 7.9 kilometers) by 10240 feet tall (1.9 miles or 3.1 kilometers). If it were an overhead area, it would be about 9.5 square miles (6093 acres or 24.7 square km), roughly the size of Block Island, Rhode Island, USA. Just the POPULATED area (225 tiles with something drawn on them) would be 529 acres, or 0.826 square miles (2.14 sq km) â€” about the size of Princeton University.\n*If the 2048x2048 PNGs were to be printed out as a single poster at 300 dpi, the poster would be 15.36 yards (14.05 meters) long and 6.07 yards (5.55 meters) tall. Most of the detail would be invisible, as these PNGs are optimized for ~72 dpi screens.\n*There is one (very dark) green pixel in {{1110|9|s|7|e}} at 1643,1165. The remainder is all grayscale.\n*At the end of the right side it shows Cueball pondering where he'll float next.\n\n==Viewers==\nThere are cheating possibilities, as people have implemented ways to explore that world more easily. You can download the full view, the easiest way to browse it is through a zooming user interface:\n*http://victorz.ca/xkcd_map/ (recommended) (It contains all the features of the following viewer, plus: content highlighted, minimap, less memory and bandwidth, and goes to infinity.)\n*http://xkcd-map.rent-a-geek.de/ (alternative if above doesn't work) (This one has zoom controls, scroll-zoom, click-and-drag, hash permalinks, and full-screen.)\n\nThis is a smaller picure of the whole image:\n[[File:1110 full tiny.png|none|frame|Whole image at 0.5% zoom. The part visible at the beginning is marked red.]]\n\n==Explanation of details and references==\n{{incomplete|Need to add the missing description/explanations/transcripts for the tiles below. Also, some thumbnails for [[#References by category]] are missing.}}\n\nThe 225 existing tiles are sorted by columns from West to East and from North to South in each column.
