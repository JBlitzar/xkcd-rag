It is among other romantic clich√©s like \"candle-lit dinners\" and may, in fact, simply indicate that the person enjoys romantic gestures and activities in general. It is likely that many people who list this in their profiles have never, in fact, taken a walk on a beach or may not live near enough to a beach for it to be a viable suggestion for a date.\n\nIn this comic, [[Randall]] lists \"long walks on the beach\" as an interest on a dating profile. However, while a romantic walk might last for half an hour or an hour before, presumably, moving on towards another activity, Randall suggests he likes walks that last several hours or even overnight, suggesting potential mates bring a tent to camp out in. \n\nThe title text suggests that those who say they like long walks on the beach are being disingenuous, or not forthcoming. He just wants someone who wants what he does; to walk an indefinite, indeterminate distance well beyond the comfort and expectations of everyone else.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A computer monitor displays the profile of a man named Randall on an online dating site. His profile contains a picture of a spiky-haired man and some text, which is rendered as dialogue in the panels.]\n:Randall: Hi, my name is Randall. I like candlelight dinners and long walks on the beach.\n:Randall: When I say long walks on the beach, I mean LONG walks on the beach. I've met people through these services who CLAIM to like long walks on the beach. But we'll be out there barely an hour before they start in with \"I'm tired\" and \"Don't you think it's time we head back?\" BRING A TENT.\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the first xkcd comic featuring [[Randall Munroe]].\n* This was also used in the \"about the author\" bio of Randall's book Thing Explainer, however, there the picture was of a [[Cueball]] and not a [[Hairy]] as shown here.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Randall Munroe]]"
