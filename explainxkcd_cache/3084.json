In the comic, this is depicted with three drawings, with an arrow representing an unstoppable force moving toward an object that is immovable. The next two images depict how they interact - or rather, not interact, with the force passing right through the object as if it weren't there. In a caption below the comic, [[Randall]] states that he cannot understand why people find this scenario to be tricky\n\nThe comic plays on the word \"force\", which has different definitions depending on context. To a physicist like Randall it describes a fundamental influence between particles of matter. Not all forces interact with all types of matter, nor ''can'' they be stopped (only depleted, by interaction and dispersion over their effective distance); as a result, although \"unstoppable forces\" seem like an impossible thing, they are in fact quite common (again, provided one is using the physics definition), something Randall exploits in line with [[123: Centrifugal Force|prior informative comics]] of this ilk. In casual language however, a \"force\" is an entity with a large amount of (usually kinetic) energy, hence the question might better be phrased as \"what happens if one attempts to apply kinetic energy to an object whose velocity cannot be changed?\".\n\nA lot of times, the \"unstoppable force / immovable object\" expression is just that, an expression, to indicate that two parties who have contradictory goals and are unwilling or unable to compromise. Other times it's an exaggeration for large and powerful forces that are not literally unstoppable but still cause massive damage when they run into each other.\n\nIn the title text, Randall clarifies what he means in that the force-carrying particles cannot interact with the matter by definition. If such objects did exist, being intangible to each other is the only possible answer that would be compatible with how we understand physics to work, as force-carrying particles can only interact with some particles. (An further explanation of this situation is described in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA video] by {{w|Minute Physics}}.) In quantum physics, all forces (electromagnetic, strong-nuclear, gravity, weak-nuclear) are carried by force-carrying particles (photons, gluons, W & Z bosons, Higgs Boson), but this is not usually something that is relevant to consider, when macroscopic objects interact.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In one panel there are three drawings representing the same scenario at three different times. The first drawing shows a right-pointing arrow at the left, and a rounded trapezium-like object set slightly to the right of center. They are each labeled with a line going from a label above down to the respective shape:]\n:Unstoppable Force\n:Immovable Object\n\n:[In the second drawing the arrow is shown in the process of moving through the trapezoid, the part of the arrow within the trapezoid is drawn in gray lines.]\n\n:[In the third drawing the arrow has moved a similar distance, now being to the right of the trapezoid.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:] \n:I don't see why people find this scenario to be tricky.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Physics]]"
