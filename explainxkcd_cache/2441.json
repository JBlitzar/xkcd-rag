The guidelines tell how fully vaccinated people should act ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210324142553/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html at time of posting]). The evaluation assumes that the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the universes where the movies take place by the time at which they take place. This is part of a [[:Category:COVID-19|continuing pattern of comics]]. In these comics Randall applies COVID-19 safety standards to pre- or post-COVID situations.\n\nAt the moment, Cueball is viewing the final confrontation between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader (formerly Anakin Skywalker), and Emperor Sheev Palpatine. This confrontation takes place on the second Death Star in ''{{w|Return of the Jedi}}''. Darth Vader wears a breathing apparatus in a mask that fully covers his face. Vader wears this because he sustained massive respiratory damage several movies earlier. During the confrontation, the Emperor is killed. Then Luke removes Vader's mask to see his face. (It is revealed in a previous film that Vader is Luke's father.) COVID-19 would be impossible for the Star Wars movies, because the Star Wars movies take place \"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\", well before COVID-19 existed.{{Citation needed}}\n\nCueball notes that if only Luke had been vaccinated, he would still be a possible risk to Vader. The various vaccines seem to do well to protect recipients from the harsher outcomes of the virus. The vaccines may not completely prevent them from mild infection and potentially then passing it onwards. Luke is young and healthy. Luke is probably less susceptible, if Luke were to be exposed to the virus at any point. Vader's health issues mean that Vader would be in much greater danger from such a respiratory disease without Vader's own personal inoculation. The Emperor is elderly, but probably not at as great of a risk as Vader is. However, the Emperor, too is susceptible if the Emperor were infected.\n\nCueball judges that Darth Vader's mask and breathing apparatus would protect Vader from the virus, a topic that was previously considered in [[2367: Masks]]. The protection is at least to a limited extent. This is not an unreasonable assumption. Vader's suit has allowed Vader to [[wikia:w:c:starwars:Darth Vader's armor#Discomfort, limitations and enhancements|survive the vacuum of space for short periods of time]]. Cueball concludes that all the characters in this fight need to be vaccinated in order to prevent the spread of the virus. This will be true until the Emperor dies. After the Emperor dies, only Vader needs to be vaccinated.\n\nThe title text refers to two separate CDC recommendations. If you are visiting with people from a single household when vaccinated, all at low risk of serious complications from COVID-19, you do not have to take precautions. The precaution that you do not have to take include physical distancing or masks. If you are visiting with people from multiple households, then it is recommended that you take precautions against the spread of the disease regardless. Cueball is unsure whether or not Darth Vader and the Emperor live in close enough proximity to count as a single household. Whether Vader and the Emperor live in a single household would change how Cueball decides who should and should not be vaccinated. It is unknown, based on the Original Trilogy of Star Wars movies alone, how much time Vader and the Emperor spend in proximity. The \"weird black egg thing\" refers to [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vader%27s_meditation_chamber Darth Vader's meditation chamber], first seen in ''{{w|The Empire Strikes Back}}'', which allows Vader to spend some time outside of his suit.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at a desk typing on a laptop. There is a large thought bubble of his thoughts above his head, and his typing on the laptop makes sounds.]\n:Cueball's thoughts: \n::For the throne room scene, I think it's all three until the Emperor dies, then Vader only. \n::It can't be Luke only, since he's visiting Vader, who is clearly at elevated respiratory risk. \n::Plus, he removes Vader's mask!\n:Keyboard: Type type.\n\n:[Caption below the panel]:\n:My Hobby: Editing IMDb to note the minimum set of people who need to be vaccinated in each scene for it to pass muster under current CDC guidance. \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:COVID-19]]\n[[Category:COVID-19 vaccine]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]"
