It's always been the cutest of our Mars rovers.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThere's a common punchline in which the plot lines of two thematically-different works of fiction (usually movies) are compared in greatly-abbreviated form, and the speaker sarcastically concludes that the two movies are \"basically the same\". For sake of example, Disney's ''{{w|Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin}}'' and {{w|James Cameron}}'s ''{{w|Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic}}'' [http://imgur.com/gallery/kasCMYd both feature a story] in which a lower-class boy and an upper-class girl fall for each other, among other cherry-picked yet interesting parallels. But due to the different emotional tones of the films, most people would not consider them to be at all similar (one is a family-friendly \"happy ever after\" tale and the other is a period romance that turns into a disaster thriller).\n\nThis comic spoofs the idea. Instead of comparing plot lines of two movies, [[Ponytail]] and [[Cueball]] compare the respective movies' development histories. ''{{w|The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian}}'' was originally a serialized story written by {{w|Andy Weir (writer)|Andy Weir}} on his blog which was later compiled into an ebook for people to easily download, then published into a physical book, and has now had a {{w|The Martian (film)|movie}} created based on it. The movie was officially released in the US on the same day this comic was released (October 2, 2015).\n\n''{{w|Fifty Shades of Grey}}'' began as a {{w|fan fiction}} of a well known brand (the {{w|Twilight (novel series)|Twilight book series}}). It was originally written on the internet by {{w|E. L. James}}. It was then transformed into a successful book series which was later turned into a {{w|Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|movie}} released in February 2015. The book was already referenced back in 2012 in [[1128: Fifty Shades]]. Since ''Fifty Shades'' is a romance story about a sadomasochistic relationship, and ''The Martian'' is a very technical story about surviving completely alone on a hostile planet, the two books could not be any more different, hence the joke due to the juxtaposition. \n\nCueball continues the joke by joining the two titles using red for Mars, to make a new book title, that should cover both books: ''Fifty Shades of Red.'' Ponytail says to Cueball that such a book would be irresistible for him. She does this by daring him to say that he wouldn't read it, believing he could not say so without lying. It is possible that the brand that ''The Martian'' derives from is {{w|NASA}} itself. ''The Martian'' has been compared to the film {{w|Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13}} by Randall in [[1536: The Martian]]. ''Apollo 13'' does indeed glorify the roles of the NASA engineers, and ''The Martian'' does a similar thing. That Randall would go see this movie as soon as it was released was already made perfectly clear back in June when he released the comic [[1536: The Martian]] showing how excited he is about the book. He then really looked forward to the movie.\n\nRandall indicates in the title text that he has just seen the movie (certainly possible, if he caught a midnight screening; perhaps he drew this comic in advance and wrote the title text after) and finds the Sojourner rover adorable. Of course, he could also have seen it in the trailers. The [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/BB-8 BB-8] mentioned in the title text is the {{w|astromech droid}} from the movie {{w|Star Wars: The Force Awakens}} and is available as a toy (see also BB-8 on the [http://www.starwars.com/databank/bb-8 official Star Wars] home page). {{w|Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner}} was the Mars ''Pathfinder'' robotic rover. Mark Watney, the main character of the book, had the rover and let it wander around like a space puppy.\n\nRandall indicated that he thinks the Sojourner is much cuter than BB-8, and that he would like to have one as a pet. He then states that the Sojourner has always been the cutest among all the [[:Category:Mars rovers|Mars rovers]]. The cuteness of Mars Rovers is also mentioned in [[2433: Mars Rovers]]. There have been five so far, the other four being {{w|Spirit (rover)|Spirit}}, {{w|Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity}}, {{w|Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity}}, and {{w|Perseverance (rover)|Perseverance}}, three of which have already been used in xkcd comics: [[695: Spirit]], [[1091: Curiosity]], and [[1504: Opportunity]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is talking to Cueball.]\n\n:Ponytail: So it's a work of fiction about a well-known brand. written on the Internet by an enthusiast, republished as a bestselling book, and then made into a big movie.\n:Cueball: Yup.\n\n:[Ponytail holds her hand to her chin. Beat panel.]\n\n:[Ponytail is talking to Cueball again.]\n:Ponytail: Yeah, ''The Martian'' and ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' are basically the same book.\n:Cueball: \"''Fifty Shades of Red?''\"\n:Ponytail: Man, ''tell'' me you wouldn't read that.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]  <!--50 shades and Martian -->\n[[Category:Mars rovers]] <!--Title text-->\n[[Category:Star Wars]] <!--Title text-->\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Twilight]]  <!--The well-known brand that 50 Shades of Grey is based upon-->"
