Also, gyroscopes caused 9/11.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] is playing with a {{w|gyroscope}}. Even though he has studied them and intellectually understands their behaviour, they still seem somewhat mysterious. At the end of the comic, the gyroscope is revealed to have the power of levitation and to apparently be a sentient lifeform (it talks to him).\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] is mocking the {{w|Moon landing conspiracy theories}} and refers to the {{w|lunar precession}} in process. Gyroscopes and the lunar orbit both exhibit precession, a physical concept that non-scientists can find hard to grasp. Thus, it is a perfect subject for a lunar conspiracy theory. He goes on to claim that gyroscopes (which form part of the navigation system of every commercial airplane) were directly responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a desk with a gyroscope in his hands.
