It is notorious for having some of the most ridiculous, hateful, mean-spirited, nonsensical comments of any mainstream website (a reputation touched upon earlier in [[202: YouTube]]).\n\n[[Danish]] tells [[Black Hat]] that her computer virus that she is writing reads a YouTube user's comments back to them before it is submitted. Upon hearing their own ridiculous comments read aloud to them, they will realize the stupidity of it and not submit the comment. YouTube later made this a real feature, although it has since been removed again. Randall posted a [https://blog.xkcd.com/2008/10/08/youtube-audio-preview blag] about this when YouTube has this as real feature.\n\nThe title text is in reference to a post left on the Yahoo! Answers website in 2006 by a submitter known as \"kavya,\" who asks [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-is-babby-formed \"how is babby formed / how girl get pragnent.\"] The post picked up internet popularity and spawned several flash animations. This was again mentioned in [[522: Google Trends]] and in [[550: Density]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat approaches Danish typing at a computer.]\n:Black Hat: What are you writing?\n:Danish: Virus.\n:Black Hat: What's it do?\n\n:Danish: When someone tries to post a YouTube comment, it first reads it aloud back to them.\n\n:Soon, everywhere:\n:[Cueball is commenting on YouTube with a laptop.]\n:''type type type''\n\n:[Youtube comment is read back.]\n\n:Cueball: ...I'm a moron.\n\n:[Cueball leaves desk and partially closes his laptop.]\n\n:[Cueball is seen sitting on steps, depressed.]\n\n:[Cueball puts his head in his hands.]\n:Cueball: I... I didn't know.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Danish]]\n[[Category:YouTube]]"
