They are typically found on carts and office chairs to make them easy to move, and may be placed on heavy appliances to facilitate movement.\n\nRandall has proposed a variant of the skateboard with only one caster on the bottom, the titular \"monocaster\", and devoted most of the comic to a {{w|Perceptual mapping|perceptual map}} showing the variety of wheeled vehicles. Market strategists and investors use such diagrams as a simple way of representing important differences between products or companies, but where a consumer might be more concerned with features like speed, cost, ease of use, or carrying capacity, this map focuses on the number of wheels (horizontal axis) and the diameter of those wheels (vertical axis).\n\nEach axis uses a logarithmic scale, which is convenient for making the map look more evenly filled but also visually exaggerates the size of the \"key gap\" that the monocaster is filling, which can be described as \"vehicle with a single wheel smaller than 25 cm\". The nearest competitors appear to be a two-wheel skateboard sometimes called a {{w|caster board}} (wheel diameter under 8 cm) and a single-wheel self-balancing board resembling a {{w|Onewheel}} (diameter around 25 cm). The Onewheel is sometimes described as a {{w|monowheel}} (though these are traditionally larger like the \"1920s monowheel\" on the upper left). Randall appears to have combined these two names to create the monocaster. This gives up several of the competitors' features - the caster board's two wheels provide enough stability to propel the vehicle manually, while the Onewheel's single wheel is wide (assisting with sideways balance) and powered by a self-balancing mechanism.\n\nThe result resembles a {{w|Balance board#Sphere-and-ring|\"Sphere-and-ring\" balance board}}, or other types, though these provide limited locomotion potential. The joke depends on the caster's obvious impracticality in this role: the hole in the market was open ''for a reason''. The obvious drawback to any single-wheeled vehicle is that it's difficult to balance: the rider has to avoid falling forward or backward, as well as to either side. This is a major reason why one-wheeled vehicles are uncommon to begin with, but those vehicles which do exist compensate by using relatively large wheels, driven either by human power or a motor, which creates rotational inertia and allows the rider to balance simply by leaning forward. \n\nA single, small, undriven wheel eliminates these balancing forces, meaning that the user would essentially need to balance on a single point. Also, most casters swivel, meaning that the balance point would move around under the rider's feet and make it even more difficult to balance. In addition, there's no apparent means of propulsion, which means the only way to move forward would be to either roll exclusively downhill, or use one foot to push off the ground. Either strategy would make retaining balance almost impossible. \n\nMultiple-wheeled vehicles greatly reduce the issue of balance simply by having multiple points of contact with the ground. The size of the wheels varies greatly; small, rigid wheels are generally suitable only for flat, smooth, rigid surfaces at relatively slow speeds, while vehicles expected to handle high speeds and varying road (and off-road) conditions will necessarily have larger wheels. \n\nThe \"monocaster\" design offers no advantages and would be nearly unrideable, making it obvious why such a vehicle has never been seriously proposed. \n\nThe title text extends the joke by listing the disadvantages mentioned above, but not providing a rebuttal. Instead it only attempts an emotional appeal by saying that the competitors are being mean and by commenting that Randall believed they were friends.\n\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! scope=\"col\" | Vehicle\n! scope=“col” | Number of wheels\n! scope=“col” | Wheel Diameter\n! scope=\"col\" | Explanation\n|-\n| 1920s Monowheel || 1 || 3 meters ||  A monowheel is a vehicle in which the rider sits inside a single, large, hollow wheel. Versions have existed which were hand- or pedal-cranked, but the \"1920s\" version portrayed here is apparently motor-driven. These vehicles have generally been seen as novelties, as their stability and practicality issues limit their usefulness for actual transport. \n|-\n| Unicycle || 1 || 45 centimeters ||  Probably the best known single-wheeled form of transport, a unicycle consists of a single wheel, usually driven directly by pedals, with a seat mounted on top. Due to their difficulty, they are most commonly used as novelties and for comic performances, more than as practical transport. \n|-\n| OneWheel || 1 || 20 centimeters ||  A one-wheeled electric skateboard in which the user stands on both sides of a large, central wheel. The design self-balances by increasing the velocity as the user leans forward. This allows balancing and speed control to operate in a single motion. \n|-\n| Bicycle || 2 || 45 centimeters ||  A two-wheeled, pedal-driven vehicle. The relatively simple, inexpensive and efficient design of these vehicles makes them practical for transport in a variety of situations. As a result, they've long been among the most popular and widely-produced vehicles in the world.\n|-\n| Scooter || 2 || 8 centimeters (*) || A two-wheeled vehicle driven either by pushing with a foot or by an electric motor or fuel-powered engine. Scooters are ridden both for recreation and as a form of transportation in cities.\n|-\n| {{w|Roller shoe}} || 2 || 1 centimeter (*) || Shoes with small wheels built into the back end of the soles, putting them underneath the wearer's heels (which is what the brand-name  \"{{w|Heelys}}\" is derived from). They allow the user access to wheeled movement by pushing off the ground and balancing on the slightly protuding wheels. They are not as fast or comfortable as a dedicated wheeled vehicle, their rolling action is limited to sufficiently flat surfaces and they are not as easy as regular shoes to simply walk in. However, such shoes allow for some degree of both walking ''and'' rolling without having to carry a separate wheeled vehicle, or necessarily having the baseline difficulty of other 'fuller' versions of wearable skates.\n|-\n| Tricycle || 3 || 20 centimeters || Appears to be a {{w|Big Wheel (tricycle)|\"Big Wheel\" type}} child's toy, which actually have smaller 'trailing wheels', rather than either {{w|Tricycle#Upright|upright}} or {{w|Tricycle#Recumbent|recumbent}} style cycles for adults which ''usually'' match the wheel-sizes of their bicycle equivalents.\n|-\n| Scooter (three-wheeled) || 3 || 3 centimeters (*) ||  Very similar to two-wheeled scooters (see above), but using two wheels in the front instead of three. This increases stability but makes the scooter less maneuverable. The modern 'tail-wheel' variant as shown (usually with lean-and-steer front wheels, rather than handlebar twisting) has superseded the traditional tricycle layout (closely paired rear wheels, single steerable front wheel) that was the more usual three-wheel version of children's scooters in the decades before the millenium. The steering geometries and ride behaviours of each type experience significantly different advantages and flaws, both also handling differently from the typical two-wheel version.\n|-\n| Monster Truck || 4 || 2.5 meters || Monster trucks are vehicles equipped with (usually four, but sometimes more) outsize wheels. They are almost always driven as part of events where specifically trained drivers use them to perform dangerous stunts and crush smaller vehicles. Because of their size, the danger to other vehicles, often very poor mileage, and design choices that can be in violation of local laws and regulations regarding motorized vehicles, monster trucks are generally illegal to drive on public roads and have to be transported in dedicated trailers, making them poor choices for transport where one has to leave private property.\n|-\n| Car || 4 || 50 centimeters || Cars are motorized vehicles designed to move one or more people and an amount of goods around fast. While almost all cars have four wheels (discounting reserve wheels), there are a few that have more than four (certain limousines) or fewer (such as the {{w|Reliant Robin}} or {{w|Morgan 3-Wheeler}}). Cars are more expensive than most options on the chart, but they also excel in speed, comfort, and flexibility.\n|-\n| ATV || 4 || 20 centimeters (*) || ATVs or \"all-terrain vehicles\" are unenclosed, handlebar-steered vehicles designed for off-road riding. They have four, large, low-pressure tires and a robust suspension system to accommodate rough terrain. They generally aren't designed to carry passengers, and have limited cargo capacity, which limits their usefulness for regular transport. They're generally used either for recreation or for transport in areas without well-maintained roads. \n|-\n| Skateboard || 4 || 2 centimeters (*) || Skateboards consist of a single board with four, small rigid wheels attached. They are generally propelled by pushing off the ground with one foot. They're commonly used for recreation and trick-riding, but can be used for short-distance transport where well-maintained and flat roads are available. \n|-\n| Three-Wheel Skates|| 6 || 4 centimeters (*) || Three-wheeled skates are a type of inline skate (shoes with a line of wheels affixed underneath the shoe) that differ from the more commonly used four wheeled inline skates by having three larger wheels. They are inexpensive and easy to maintain, but they require significant skill to use effectively and the user is reliant on smooth surfaces to skate around on. Another downside is that the wheels cannot be removed from the shoes, requiring the user to either carry an extra pair or have an extra pair at their destination.\n|-\n| Roller Skates|| 8 || 2 centimeters (*) || Roller skates are shoes with small wheels underneath them in a rectangular pattern. This makes roller skates much more stable than inline skates, allowing users to stand on them with more ease. Like inline skates they are cheap and low maintenance, but in order to move any significant distance without support they require a skilled user, smooth surfaces and the user needs backup shoes when taking them off (though there exist strap-on roller skates).\n|-\n| Semi-Trailer Truck (Articulated Lorry) || 10-18 || 1 meter || A semi-trailer truck is a motorized vehicle designed to pull trailers that can be easily decoupled from the truck itself. This allows the truck to switch trailers and move a different cargo without having to unload the trailer. The name in brackets that was used here (articulated lorry) is a name most commonly used in British English (or \"artic\", for short), with articulation meaning that the truck can swivel at the point where the truck connects to the trailer. This allows for the truck to make much tighter turns than if it were one long vehicle, which is another advantage of this configuration, with typically more stability than with a {{w|Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar}} attachment. Trucks are designed to haul cargo for long distances, with the cargo in question being either too heavy or too large to carry with a smaller hopper, tanker, hard-/soft-sided container or flatbed placed entirely upon a single truck chassis. They are driven either by drivers employed by a transport company, or by self-employed individuals who haul cargo for a living. A specialized license is required to drive one, and because of their size (even without a trailer), trucks have more limitations on where they can drive and park than normal cars. Like cars, trucks are a source of leisure, but because of the higher cost to purchase, maintain and drive them, they are more often enjoyed for their aesthetics rather than actually driving them for leisure. There are events like races for trucks, and trucks can be given elaborate paint jobs to have them stand out.\nThe number of wheels is for both the {{w|Tractor unit#Axles|truck}} and a {{w|Semi-trailer#Types|trailer}}, which can each differ vastly between vehicle configurations.  The truck in the comic has five ''obvious'' axle-sets (thus at least ten actual wheels): a single pair of front wheels, two pairs of trailer-bearing rear wheels and two pairs of wheels on the trailer itself. The drawing of the truck actually spans the axis range of three wheels (unlikely to be true, and the minimum for a tractor-trailer would normally be six) all the way up to 16, so it's not entirely clear which number (≥10) Randall intends this one to portray. Most of the other illustrations are roughly centered over the relevant number of wheels, but applying this to the truck implies six wheels, which is clearly wrong as illustrated.\n|}\n\n\n(*) It seems that Randall has made some mistakes in regards to the wheel sizes, especially in the centimeter range of the diagram. Most of the vehicles have bigger wheels and the number would suggest hat he meant inches instead of centimeters. Alternatively, he may have mistakenly recorded the wheels' radius instead of its diameter, as intended.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A chart picturing many wheeled vehicles with a caption below the chart window.
