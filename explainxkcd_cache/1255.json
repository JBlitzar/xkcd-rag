However, this is a false narrative known as the {{w|Myth of the Flat Earth}}. Educated people in Columbus's time knew the world was round, and knew the approximate radius of the Earth. Columbus claimed that the distance to sail west from Canary Islands to Japan to be about 3,700 km, drastically lower than others believed, but {{w|Christopher Columbus#Geographical considerations|he was wrong about this}}. If another continent and the \"{{w|West Indies}}\" had not been fortuitously in the right place, Columbus and his crew probably would have died at sea.\n\nAs White Hat begins his explanation, Megan objects, though not explaining why. White Hat continues, so Megan interrupts, saying that Columbus went in a straight line as the world curved away, ending up in {{w|Valinor}} and the {{w|Undying Lands}}. Megan's story is an allusion to ''{{w|The Silmarillion}}'', by {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien}}, set in the same world as ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings}}'' and ''{{w|The Hobbit}}''. The claim that Columbus sailed on a tangent to the surface alludes to how the elves' ships leave the curved sea surface and sail in a straight line to reach Valinor on the same route that they sailed when the world was still flat. The mentions of a silmaril and the morning star are a reference to {{w|Eärendil|Eärendil the Mariner}}, the only mortal sailor to reach the Undying Lands, with one of the {{w|Silmaril}}s (though Eärendil's journey occurred at the end of the First Age and the world was only changed into a sphere near the end of the Second Age). Megan humorously conflates these myths, suggesting that they are all equally false. Columbus in fact wasn't the first to claim the world was round; the ancient Greeks had discovered it long before. It was, however, disputed by some Christian scholars {{w|Spherical_Earth#Late_Antiquity|in late antiquity}} due to disagreements over its congruence with biblical canon. In Megan's telling, Columbus ends up as the morning star, which is actually the planet {{w|Venus}} (the same fate as Eärendil's in Tolkien's mythology).\n\nThe joke is that when White Hat tells her to stop making up the story, Megan pointedly replies \"You first\", indicating that she originally complained about White Hat's retelling of the Columbus story because his account didn't really happen, and so he was also \"making things up\". Megan's fantasy tale was then delivered to make a point.\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Smallpox#History|transfer of smallpox}} to the Americas by Europeans, which caused the deaths of untold millions of Native Americans. The introduction of smallpox to the Undying Lands would indeed make their name ironic.  However, the Undying Lands are named after immortal {{w|Valar}}, {{w|Maiar}}, and {{w|elf (Middle-Earth)|Elves}} living there, not because they confer immortality.  A more proper name would be the Lands of the Undying, and Valar, Maiar, and Elves are not susceptible to diseases in Tolkien's mythos in any case.\n\nSimilar discussions between White Hat and Megan can be found in [[1605: DNA]] and [[1731: Wrong]], in the latter Megan even finishes with a similar *sigh* as she started with here.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat talks to two children sitting in front of him on the floor to the right. A boy with hair like Hairy with his arms round his knees and behind him Jill with two hair buns, sitting cross-legged on her knees. Megan interrupts him from off-panel right.]\n:White Hat: Everyone said the world was flat, but Columbus knew it was round.\n:Megan (off-panel): *Sigh* no, no, no.\n\n:[Megan walks in holding a hand palm up. White Hat partly lifts his arm closest to her. The children between them turn their heads towards her. The boy leans back on one hand.]\n:Megan: So he took his ships and sailed west—\n:Megan: —in a line tangent to the surface. The sea fell away, and he landed in ''Valinor.''\n\n:[White Hat has taken his arm down, Megan holds her arms out to each side. The children still look at her, now also Jill leans back on one arm.]\n:Megan: A Silmaril on his brow, he wanders the heavens as the morning star, still believing he reached India.\n:White Hat: Stop making stuff up.\n:Megan: You first.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Jill]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]] <!-- Columbus -->\n[[Category:LOTR]]"
