Chesterton wrote in [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Alarms_and_Discursions/The_Red_Town an essay]: ''It is stupid to say that \"most people\" are stupid. It is like saying \"most people are tall,\" when it is obvious that \"tall\" can only mean taller than most people. It is absurd to denounce the majority of mankind as below the average of mankind.''\n\nIt is a common thing for people on the Internet (on forums and comments sections of various websites) to make vague generalizations about the \"stupidity of all people\" or \"losing faith in humanity,\" for instance when the topic is actually the stupidity or irrational/extreme behavior of one individual or group of individuals. The comment can come in any type of Internet forum, regardless of the subject.\n\nHowever, the overall {{w|world population}} (\"people\") is not more stupid than the average - by definition. There is also no other human population to compare to <!-- intentional double \"to\" --> to draw the conclusion this population is stupid. So it is a ''stupid'' comment that [[White Hat]] makes. The award being given to him by [[Cueball]] is thus a very sarcastic one.\n\nIt is possible that for a non-normal distribution of intelligence a median individual could be less intelligent than the mean. However, the statement as it is usually formulated (including here), \"People are stupid,\" refers to humanity as a whole. White Hat's anecdotal and subjective experience has led him to make a statistically impossible statement.\n\nWhite Hat's {{W|Illusory superiority|self-perceived superiority}} may be an example of the {{w|Lake Wobegon#The Lake Wobegon effect|Lake Wobegon effect}}, so named because {{w|Lake Wobegon}} (a fictional city) is \"where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average\".\n\nThe last panel may be a reference to the ''First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence'' which is a fictional award in the story of ''{{w|The Simpsons}}'' episode ''{{w|Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?}}'' where it is presented to {{w|Homer Simpson}}.\n\nIn the title text the other phrase about having ''lost their faith in humanity'' also gets a comment on the way from Cueball. There are people who use this phrase every time someone disagrees with them or say something they think is stupid. He jokes that he will let humanity (everyone other than the guy who makes the comment) know that he has lost faith in them - and very sarcastically remarks that humanity will probably be crushed (i.e. the rest of the world does not care if that guy has lost faith in them).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat and Cueball are standing next to each other.]\n:White Hat: Well, you know, people are stupid.\n:Cueball: *Sigh*\n\n:[They have moved a little further apart.]\n:Cueball: No, people aren't stupid. On average, people are of average intelligence. When you say \"people are stupid,\" you mean stupid compared to ''your'' expectations.\n\n:[Close up of Cueball.]\n:Cueball: What you're really saying is \"other people aren't as smart as '''me.'''\"\n:Cueball: And maybe you're right! In which case\n\n:[White Hat is presented with a trophy by Cueball.]\n:Cueball: I'd like to bestow upon you the\n:[In the panel there is a close up of the trophy plaque (the text is in a frame):]\n:First Annual Award for Excellence in Being Very Smart\n:Cueball: May you continue to grace our internet with your wisdom\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]"
