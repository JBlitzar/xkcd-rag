I hear it's quite pleasant and hardly Hitler-y at all.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic came out 2 weeks after the beta version of the at that time not yet released {{w|Windows 7}} got leaked on the internet, and 2 days after a trojan-infected version got leaked as well. [[Megan]] is observing [[Cueball]] use a laptop on which he has installed the Windows 7 beta. However, the alleged Windows 7 beta is showing nothing but a picture of {{w|Adolf Hitler}} and Cueball is unable to do anything. This could hint at the version containing malware. Cueball then presses {{w|Control-Alt-Delete}} (the well-known Windows Secure Attention Sequence which opens Task Manager or displays a list of options which includes 'Shut Down' and 'Restart') as suggested by Megan, but {{tvtropes|AdolfHitlarious|only manages to make the picture's eyes flash}}.\n\nThe fourth panel shows Megan commenting that this Windows 7 beta is better than {{w|Windows Vista}}, to which Cueball agrees. The joke is that Megan deems a mostly non-functional and vaguely sinister OS, which is likely malware, better than Windows Vista, which was generally perceived as one of the worst Windows OSes.\n\nThe title text is a disclaimer stating that [[Randall]] has not tried the beta at the time this comic was written, but what he has heard about it he regards as at least mildly positive. However, he also {{tvtropes|DamnedByFaintPraise|damns it by faint praise}}, referring to it as hardly \"Hitler-y\" at all, a statement that could raise warning flags, as one would not generally expect an operating system to be able to be described as \"Hitler-y\" to any degree at all.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is standing behind Cueball sitting at a desk using his laptop.]\n:Megan: What are you doing?\n:Cueball: Trying the Windows 7 beta.\n:Megan: Why is it showing a picture of Hitler?\n:[The laptop's screen is shown with Adolf Hitler's face on it, drawn in regular ''xkcd'' style with no facial features other than his hairstyle and mustache.]\n:Cueball: I don't know. I can't get it to do anything else.\n:Megan: There's no UI?\n:Cueball: No, just Hitler.\n:[Return to the original scene, except Megan is now scratching her head in confusion.]\n:Megan: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete?\n:Cueball: It just makes Hitler's eyes flash.\n:Megan: Huh.\n:[Scene remains basically the same, except Megan is no longer scratching her head and Cueball is no longer typing on the laptop.]\n:Megan: Well, it's better than Vista.\n:Cueball: True.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Cueball's computer problems]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring politicians]]"
