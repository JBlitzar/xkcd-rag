Flooring made of hardwood (oak, maple, etc.) panels, perhaps deprecated by earlier homeowners for comfort or style reasons, can be prized by later homeowners as tastes or fashions change. Hardwood floors are currently considered desirable in homes for durability, aesthetic appeal and other reasons, and may have been the original choice for the building, but aspirations constantly change and intermediate decoration may have overlaid carpetting or {{w|linoleum}}/{{w|Sheet vinyl flooring|vinyl}} at a time that this was considered more fashionable or practical.\n\nIn this comic [[Blondie]] has apparently explained {{w|Stratum|geological strata}} to [[Cueball]], who refers to finding a “hardwood floor” under these layers. The joke is that the characters are talking about the {{w|Earth's crust}}, rather than about a house.  The “hardwood floor” is actually a {{w|Fossil fuel|fossiliferous}} {{w|Coal|coal seam}} from the {{w|Carboniferous}} period, 300-360 million years ago, that originated as woody plants and other material. The “layers” are overlying geological strata that are likely hundreds or thousands of meters thick, making it impractical, if not impossible, to tear them up, and making it unlikely that there is any aesthetic reason to expose the “hardwood” layer.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that typical {{w|Carboniferous#Plants|Carboniferous plants}} would all be classified as {{w|Softwood|softwoods}} or even not woody at all; flowering plants ({{w|Flowering plants|angiosperms}}), the principal source of today's {{w|hardwoods}}, would not appear on Earth in any significant numbers for another 220 million years. However, whatever it would be classified as in the beginning, it is now “hardwood” in the literal sense of wood that is hard, as it is now all coal and other rock.\n\nThe idea of using geology in relation to houses is also used the [[:Category:Home Inspections|Home Inspections]] series and in [[3070: Orogeny]], all released relatively close to each other.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is looking down and pointing with a finger towards the floor in front of Blondie who is facing him. Behind her is a picture on the wall showing seven sedimentary layers above each other, assuming the top of the picture is air. Each layer has a different texture than the ones it borders but two are as white as the air at the top, including the bottom-most layer.]\n:Cueball: So you're saying that if we tear up these layers, there's hardwood flooring under here?\n:Blondie: ...I mean, sort of...\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Home remodelers learn about the Carboniferous\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Blondie]]\n[[Category:Geology]]"
