(See here regarding [[1723: Meteorite Identification]]).\n\nIn the first panel of the comic, [[Cueball]] finds a {{w|meteorite}} on the ground, likely from the {{w|Perseids}} meteor shower. He then tries to throw it back into space, which is obviously impossible. However, the comic marks this action as wrong (with an X) not because it’s impossible, but for a different reason. The PSA in the next panel (marked as correct with a check mark) suggests that instead of throwing it, Cueball should contact an observatory and deliver the meteorite to them. There, astronomers like [[Ponytail]] can care for it, possibly releasing it back into space during the next launch. \n\nThis idea mixes up the concept of meteoroids with baby animals that have been separated from their parents and need rehabilitation—like baby birds that have fallen from their nests (though usually from trees rather than the sky). The advice for finding a wild animal, especially a baby one, is generally to leave it alone because its parents are likely nearby and taking care of it. If the animal is sick, injured, or orphaned, it's best to contact a wildlife rehabilitator who can properly care for it and return it to the wild. However, this advice does not apply to meteors.{{Citation needed}}\n\nIf you find a recently fallen meteorite or a {{w|Meteor air burst|fragment}} of one, avoid touching it, as it may be extremely cold. Though the meteor’s surface is heated by the atmosphere during its descent, the interior remains as cold as space, and the surface will rapidly cool if it hasn't already. The coldness depends on the meteorite’s size, fragmentation, and how long it has been on the ground—unless it was {{w|Impact crater#Impact craters on Earth|large enough}} to generate additional heat from the {{w|Lithobraking|impact}}. Experts prefer you not handle meteorites directly, as this can contaminate the specimen, making it less valuable for scientific study. In rare cases, such as with {{tvtropes|GreenRocks|more dangerous examples}}, the meteorite could even contaminate ''you''!\n\n[[1475: Technically|Technically]], [[Randall]] uses the term \"meteor\" incorrectly. A \"meteor\" refers to the streak of light seen when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere. If a piece survives and lands on the ground, it's called a \"meteorite\" (although some refer to it as [[1405: Meteor|magma]]). This might be intentional to fit the \"lost baby bird\" analogy, as, like baby birds (except for those from {{w|Bird nest#Type|ground-nesting}} species), a true meteor should never be found on the ground.\n\nThe title text humorously suggests that handling the meteor for too long might result in forming a {{w|contact binary (small Solar System body)|contact binary}}, which is when two space rocks stick together. While this term is also used for binary star systems, it’s unlikely that a person and a rock would form one.{{Citation needed}} In rehabilitating young animals, preventing {{w|Imprinting_(psychology)|imprinting}}—where the animal forms a psychological attachment to its caregiver—is important because the animal needs to be able to survive in the wild without human help.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A two panel comic with the panels next to each other.]\n \n:[In the left side of the first panel, Cueball spots a meteorite on the ground. It lies a bit buried in the earth between tufts of grass. On the right side, he's shown throwing the rock into the air, with small lines indicating the flight of the meteorite. There's an \"X\" above him. Above this there is the following text:]\n:This meteor shower weekend, remember: If you find a meteor on the ground, don't try to return it to the sky yourself.\n\n:[In the left side of the second panel, Cueball is holding the meteorite in one hand and talking on his cellphone in his other hand, there's a check mark above him. In the middle of the panel Cueball is holding the meteorite out in both hands handing it to Ponytail who is also holding both hand out to receive it. To the right in the panel a rocket is blasting upwards with fire coming out beneath it and a plume of smoke showing its ascending path. Above this there is the following text:]\n:Instead, contact an observatory where astronomical rehabbers will care for it, and hopefully release it back into the wild with the next space launch.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Public service announcement]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]"
