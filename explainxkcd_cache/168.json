In this comic, [[Cueball]] uses swear words in the place of benign terms, inverting the typical usage of euphemisms. To \"drop the kids off at the pool\" is a euphemism meaning to \"go take a shit.\" In this case, however, Cueball actually has to drop kids off at the pool but instead uses \"go take a shit.\" Cueball is {{tvtropes|UnusualEuphemism|using the euphemism in reverse}}, hence the title. \n\nIn the title text, the figure is waiting for a situation in which he has to see a man concerning a horse, as this relates to another euphemism meaning to urinate. It can be assumed that, when telling someone about seeing the man about the horse, he would say \"...then I had to go take a piss.\"\n\nThis is not to be confused with the opposite of a euphemism called a {{w|dysphemism}}, despite this comic being the image used for {{tvtropes|UnusualDysphemism|Unusual Dysphemism}} on TV Tropes.\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby: Reverse Euphemisms\n:[Two people talking.]\n:Cueball: Oh, hey, school just let out and it's YMCA night, so I've gotta go take a shit.\n:Friend: What?\n:Cueball: I mean I actually have to drop the kids off at the pool.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
