Me. This moment.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe line \"it has come to this\" is usually seen on the verge of the climactic confrontation between the {{w|villain}} and their arch rival, or when one character has to unleash their utmost ability, etc. Despite its dramatic tone, however, the statement is a content-free tautology, true in all possible scenarios in which time progresses in a forward direction. Accordingly, [[Cueball]] is saying it when [[Megan]] tells him that they have run out of cat food, a relatively trivial problem that could be solved with a quick trip to the grocery store.\n\nThe title text is a follow-up on the comic dialogue. When Megan replies in confusion, \"Come to what?\" Cueball then uses another instantly-dramatic phrase that keeps his words ambiguous, only leaving her in the dark. \n\nOther comics which advocate using catch-all phrases as standard responses for any comment:\n*[[174: That's What SHE Said]]\n*[[178: Not Really Into Pokemon]]\n*[[559: No Pun Intended]]\n*[[1215: Insight]]\n*[[1627: Woosh]]\n*[[1656: It Begins]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan holds up an open and empty bag with the white silhouette of a cat's face on it. Cueball looks down at the bag.]\n:Megan: We ran out of cat food.\n:Cueball: ''So''\n:Cueball: ''It has come to this.''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Protip: If you're not sure what to say, try \"So it has come to this\" &ndash; it creates instant dramatic tension and is a valid observation in literally any situation.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe phrase \"So it has come to this\" is also said in: [[225: Open Source]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Protip]]\n[[Category:Cats]]"
