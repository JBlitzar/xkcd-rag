The overarching joke revolves around the fact that Linux, especially home PC-based GNU/Linux, was (at the time of this comic's publication in 2008) much more often used as a \"hobby\" OS, as compared against a \"productivity\" OS such as {{w|Windows}} or {{w|macOS}}.  Large numbers of people use Windows or Mac by default, because it came with their computer hardware when they bought it, and it already had the software suite they wanted to use installed along with it.  Linux, on the other hand, rarely comes pre-installed on PC hardware and generally must be deliberately chosen and acquired.  While it can be set up to achieve efficient and productive workflow in virtually any area on PCs, because it often must be consciously selected, installed, and configured by users, it tends to either attract or, in a few cases, create individuals who take disproportionate pleasure in, and derive self-identification from, hacking the operating system itself.  Thus, many people who are {{w|Linux}} {{w|Hacker (hobbyist)|enthusiasts}} began by not really knowing anything about it other than that it's {{w|Gratis|free of cost}}, but the process of actually building Linux on their machines gradually led them to take an increasing interest in it, which the comic humorously likens to substance addiction.\n\nXorg (officially {{w|X.Org Server|X.Org}}) is an implementation of the X Window System, a program responsible for the graphical display used on Linux.  If it has configuration problems, which was quite common with some video card drivers back in 2008 (especially {{w|fglrx#Linux|those for ATI Radeon cards}}), it is often difficult and/or painful to fix (see [[963: X11]]).  {{w|man page|Man pages}} are manual pages for Unix-based operating systems and software, usually accessible online but also bundled with the software itself.  Considered helpful and clear by the sorts of advanced computer users who typically run Linux, the text-only documentation can seem inaccessible for less-technical users.  Here, the joke starts to build in that Cueball's cousin, a computer novice who just wanted something to work out of the box, is now having to learn how to understand Linux documentation in order to fix her ongoing Xorg problem (likely an inability to start a graphical environment, something a novice user would depend on).\n\nIn the third panel, we see that the cousin has had new problems.  Though she likely has been able to fix Xorg, she is now having problems with Ubuntu's auto-configuration tools.  She suggests that she is considering switching to a more advanced Linux distro in order to sidestep the failing autoconfig issues.  A Linux \"distro\" (distribution) is a suite of tools and applications that provides a specific user experience on top of the core Linux operating system.  Each distro has a different look and feel and different feature sets and design philosophies.  {{w|Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu}} is a very popular \"beginner\" version of Linux, designed to \"just work\" and be familiar and usable to people fresh out of Windows.  {{w|Debian}} is a popular but somewhat more \"advanced,\" traditionally \"{{w|Unix-like}}\", distro, with a huge and diverse base of supported software that generally requires more Linux know-how to configure and use.  In fact, Ubuntu is based on Debian, and under the hood they have similar features, so that it would not be considered much of a leap for a competent Ubuntu user to switch.  {{w|Gentoo Linux|Gentoo}}, on the other hand, is a very advanced distro allowing for extreme customization and optimization, but requiring extensive install and setup time.  It is generally considered to be complex and beginner-unfriendly (to the point that its difficulty has become somewhat memetic in the Linux world), a trade-off for providing a powerful and versatile set of tools for advanced system hacking.  It appears that during the past four weeks, Cueball's cousin has started to consider that solving her problem would require complex tweaking.\n\nIn the fourth panel, it appears that the cousin has indeed switched to Gentoo, because a hallmark of that distribution is that the kernel (the basic core of the operating system) must be compiled from source code upon installation.  Source code is a computer program expressed in human-readable text; however, source code cannot be run directly by a computer, and instead needs to be compiled into low level machine instructions the computer can understand.  This means that with Gentoo, instead of downloading an already functional Linux system to install and run, users download the source code for the system, customize it to their own needs, then compile the code into a executable version of the OS, all before they can begin to use the system.  Reasons that the cousin may want to do this include needing the kernel to be compiled in a non-standard way that is not supported by more mainstream distros, or incorporating third-party code or even her own modifications into the kernel.  Compiling a kernel with the aforementioned modifications is a tricky affair, since any mistake or oversight can render the kernel, and thus operating system, non-functional, requiring the custom kernel to be anew.  This panel implies that this has indeed happened, with the cousin compiling the kernel over and over again for days without sleep.  To many such advanced users, their installation of Linux is like a hobby car: a project to be constantly tweaked and adjusted to fit one's exact needs, that spends as much time sitting around with its hood open as it is actually used for its ostensible purpose.  By week 12, it is likely that Cueball's cousin has totally forgotten about her original plans for the computer and has become obsessed with Linux in a way that Randall compares with drug addiction for comic effect.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth panel, Randall riffs on the old anti-drug message \"Parents, talk to your kids about drugs before someone else does,\" with the meaning being if a responsible adult does not educate their kids about the dangers of drugs (or Linux), then someone else (likely a peer) might convince them that drugs (or Linux) is a good idea.  There is an additional call to the theory of {{w|gateway drugs}}, where mild drugs like alcohol or cannabis will lead to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin.  In the comic, Cueball's cousin starts out with Ubuntu, a \"gateway\" version of Linux, which leads to Gentoo, a harder, more niche version, with the end result being her vanishing for weeks inside her house, compiling her kernel, like a junkie hopelessly hooked on drugs.\n\nThe title text continues the joke about Linux's poor support for many {{w|Wi-Fi}} cards common in 2008, a device that is not only well supported on Windows, but was typically seen as making networking easy for less technical users.\n\nWhile the comic sarcastically pokes fun at the difficulties in using Linux (circa 2008), it also indirectly shows some of its advantages.  The first one is that it is a freely available alternative to Windows; the second is that it provides users the tools to make fixing problems possible, whereas with Windows, the only problems that are fixed are the ones Microsoft chooses to fix; and the third is that it can increase one's knowledge of one's own computer, as the cousin, who barely seems to know how computers work past very basic end-user functionality, has become extremely advanced after several weeks.  The comic is also somewhat anachronistic, as over time, hardware support in Linux has become much more robust; it is currently unlikely that Cueball's cousin would experience broken graphics or wind up in kernel compile hell to enable basic functions such as Wi-Fi.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Linux: A True Story:\n:[Cueball talks on a cell phone.]\n:Week One:\n:Cousin: Hey, it's your cousin. I got a new computer but don't want Windows. Can you help me install \"Linux\"?\n:Cueball: Sure.\n\n:[Cueball's cousin sits in an office chair with her laptop on her lap. She is on the phone.]\n:Week Two:\n:Cousin: It says my XORG is broken. What's an \"XORG\"? Where can I look that up?\n:Cueball: Hmm, lemme show you man pages.\n\n:[Cueball's cousin crouches on the floor with the laptop on her lap. She is still on the phone.]\n:Week Six:\n:Cousin: Due to auto-config issues, I'm leaving Ubuntu for Debian.\n:Cueball: Uh.\n:Cousin: Or Gentoo.\n:Cueball: Uh oh.\n\n:[Cueball's cousin lies on her stomach with the laptop on the floor. On the floor are several pieces of paper and a book. Cueball stands to her left.]\n:Week Twelve:\n:Cueball: You haven't answered your phone in days.\n:Cousin: Can't sleep.
