This comic also serves to [[:Category: Book promotion|promote his new book]] as it states that this flow chart is taken from the ''[[What If? 2]]'' book, and the shorter link to his promotion page is written in the comic: [https://xkcd.com/whatif2  xkcd.com/whatif2]. The what if? blog as well as both books gives answers to odd or strange science questions.\n\nIn general, there are very narrow ranges of temperature, pressure, and chemical makeup humans can survive in. Human physicists necessarily spend all their time in these conditions and think of them as ordinary. The physics of these ordinary conditions has already been thoroughly studied, which makes them now familiar and boring. Instead physicists get excited to study more extreme conditions, most of which would be quickly lethal to humans — anything from the event horizons of black holes to the vacuum of space, to volumes where charged particles traveling near the speed of light are forced to collide, and many, many things in between. Thus, extreme conditions are very dangerous for most organisms. Even for especially resilient organisms, such as tardigrades, there is a point past which they will [https://what-if.xkcd.com/141/ stop being biology and start being physics], in which case their resilience will not save them. Thus if a physicist is excited about something, it likely exists in circumstances where your own existence — as well as other life — would meet an end. One (partial) exception is particle beams; {{w|Anatoli Bugorski|people can stick their heads in particle beams and survive — but not unscathed}}. Also, physicists used to be excited about (particles produced by) cosmic rays before they had powerful accelerators.\n\nClicking anywhere in the comic takes the user to the link.
