White}} (perhaps better known as the author of ''{{w|Charlotte's Web}}'' and ''{{w|Stuart Little}}''), is commonly referred to as \"''Strunk & White''\". In this comic, the current editors of ''Strunk & White'' are clarifying a matter of style pertaining to the style guide, an instance of {{w|meta humor}}, a recurring theme in ''xkcd''.\n\nErotic fan fiction is a genre of writing in which fans make up erotic stories involving characters from non-erotic stories. \"{{w|Slash fiction}}\" is a subgenre that pairs characters of the same sex: These pairings are denoted by using the \"/\" to separate the paired characters, hence the name \"slash fiction\". This convention is generally thought to originate with the {{w|Kirk/Spock}} pairing in {{w|Star Trek: The Original Series|''Star Trek''}} fan fiction, wherein \"K/S\" was used for such romantic or erotic works of fan fiction, while \"K&S\" was used for non-romantic works. This comic imagines a similar distinction being necessary for \"''Strunk & White''\" vs. \"Strunk/White\".\n\nThe title text comments that authors of Strunk/White fan fiction will most likely have read ''The Elements of Style'', which makes them better writers.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairbun, with glasses, sits behind a desk typing on a computer. A line goes from the keyboard indicating that the text above is the one she types. Behind her stand Cueball with a book in his hand, and a man with male-pattern baldness holding up a smoking pipe.]\n\n:Dear Internet,\n::We, the current editors of \n:Strunk & White's ''The Elements of''\n:''Style'', must—with great reluctance—\n:clarify a point of orthography:\n\n::\"Strunk & White\" should be \n:used for the style manual and \n:\"Strunk/White\" for the erotic \n:fan fiction pairing.\n\n==Trivia==\nE.B. White is mentioned again in the later comics, [[2162: Literary Opinions]] and [[1087: Cirith Ungol]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
