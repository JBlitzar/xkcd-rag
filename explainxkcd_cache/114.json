This has become a common target of mockery for its tendency to claim that 'no one understands me,' when in fact such feelings are common amongst teenagers, which is probably why he now feels that they are too easy a target for him.\n\nInstead, Black Hat has chosen to attack {{w|computational linguistics}}, an interdisciplinary field that combines theoretical linguistics, artificial intelligence, statistics, and other areas of study, to attempt to create a rule-based model of language. This has given rise to a number of competing theories, some of which may appear to contradict each other. He may be associating the two groups, suggesting that computational linguists are constantly bemoaning that their 'field is so ill-defined,' and that this has similarities to the emos' refrain above, or he may just be taking a swipe at them by suggesting that they think themselves above normal scientific methods.\n\nLinguistics itself is still a hotly debated subject, as is seen by the various conflicting theories on the origin of languages like the forms of {{w|Proto-Indo-European}} language.\n\nThe title text is a reference to some of the people who contributed to language theory:\n*{{w|Noam Chomsky}} is an influential American psychologist and linguist who, based on cross-cultural studies, proposed a still-disputed theory that the human brain is unique from that of other species in that it includes a fundamental Language Acquisition Device (LAD) that is pre-programmed with basic rules of grammar and syntax: thus, language is innate to humans.\n*{{w|Generative linguistics}} is a term within linguistics that is used in several ways, some of which are contradictory. This may be why it is chosen as a target by [[Black Hat]].\n*{{w|Ryan North}} is the author of the webcomic ''{{w|Dinosaur Comics}}'', and has a degree in computational linguistics.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is standing next to a large badge that says FUCK Computational Linguistics.]\n:Black Hat: And the dumbest thing about emo kids is that... I... You know, I'm sick of easy targets. Anyone can make fun of emo kids. You know who's had it too easy? Computational Linguists. \"Ooh, look at me! My field is so ill-defined, I can subscribe to any of dozens of contradictory models and still be taken seriously!\"\n\n==Trivia==\nRyan North later teased [[Randall]] in the title text of [http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2420 this comic].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Artificial Intelligence]]"
