'MAYBE A LITTLE!' 'OK, FIVE MORE MINUTES.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Megan]] and [[Cueball]] get the idea to build a rotating bed from a TV show like {{w|MTV Cribs|Cribs}}, which documents the decadent homes of the wealthy. The comic starts {{w|in medias res}}, leaving readers confused or concerned until the silly cause of the situation is revealed.\n\nRotating beds are typically used for sexual activity and variety, but Cueball and Megan have made theirs rotate far too fast, like a {{w|Roundabout (play)|merry-go-round}}, to be useful for this purpose.\n\nThe last panel is a flashback to earlier that day, when they see a rotating bed on television. Megan comments that a rotating bed does not seem difficult to build.\n\nThe title text implies that the high speed of rotation is not accidental as we may have assumed from the comic, but intentional, due to Megan and Cueball's erroneous belief that the rotation itself is supposed to turn them on, not the sexual activity they would engage in on the moving bed. A turning bed is also a pun with \"turned-on.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball clinging onto bed sheets while being dragged away by centrifugal force.]\n:Cueball: AAAAAAAA\n\n:[Megan similarly clinging on.]\n:Megan: AAAAAAAA\n\n:[Overhead shot of both spinning around a plain white circle in a room with other accoutrements.]\n:Both: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n:[Cueball is sitting on a couch watching TV and Megan is standing behind the couch, with a frame overlapping the top of the panel containing a heading.]\n:Heading: Earlier that day...\n:Cueball: Haha, check it out&ndash;This guy's mansion has an actual rotating bed.\n:Megan: You know, I bet it wouldn't be too hard to build one of those...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
