The previous one was [[48: Found]], and the next one was [[50: Penny Arcade]]. It was among the [[:Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com|last eleven comics]] posted both on LiveJournal and on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] after the new site was launched. This comic was published on the same day across both sites, but not all of them shared the same posting day.\n\n==Explanation==\nCueball is making an honest profession of his feelings. This is often held up as a valuable thing in cementing a relationship. In the first three panels, he makes the kind of cliched poetic, romantic statements that would typically be expected. In the last panel, however, he undercuts all of this by crassly revealing that he also really wants to have sex with his paramour's sister. This theme would later be used in [[279: Pickup Lines]], [[317: That Lovin' Feelin']], and panel 20 of [[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel]].\n\nIn the title text, Cueball attempts to excuse his statement by reasoning that the sister is incredibly attractive.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing talking in the same position in all four panels. In the second panel, Cueball seems to have hair.]\n:Cueball: I want to be brave enough to tell you how I feel.\n\n:Cueball: I want to say \"I love you\" <u>before</u> I hang up the phone for once.\n\n:Cueball: I want to drive all night with you, listening to mix tapes, not caring where we end up.\n\n:Cueball: Oh, and I also really want to get with your sister.\n:Cueball: I mean, DAMN.\n\n==Trivia==\n* This comic was [[:Category:Saturday comics|released on a Saturday]]. It was released only 19 minutes before midnight at 11:41 PM.\n* This used to be one of the [[Footer comics|footer comics]] featured in the bottom segment of [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 46]]\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Footer comics]] <!-- in initial footer -->\n[[Category:Your sister]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
