One-liners are short, punchy phrases, typically witty or funny, and are routinely used in films by the antagonist to taunt the protagonist (or vice versa). The perfect one-liner leaves the recipient at a loss for a comeback, and should make sense immediately. If the phrase doesn't make sense or has to be explained, the effect is lost.\n\nThe phrases shown adhere to the witty and punchy stereotype of a classical one-liner, but quickly become more niche and only understandable for an informed subgroup. \n\n;You're going down the memory hole now, asshole.\n:The {{w|Memory hole}} is a mechanism for redacting documents, photographs, etc., and a reference to {{w|George Orwell}}'s novel ''{{w|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}''. In this instance it implies that the character on the floor is about to be 'erased' from existence.\n\n;Hey! You forgot to carry the two. \n:[[Cueball]], lying on the ground in a fight, while his opponent has the high ground, still appears to be at an advantage since he has a gun and his opponent only has a knife, is pointing out an arithmetic error in his opponent's calculations. This may simply be Cueball adding insult to injury \"I'm about to shoot you, but first I'm going to point out that you suck at math\". Alternatively, it could be a ruse to distract the knife wielding opponent, or a case of well-timed [[356|nerd-sniping]]. It could also be that Cueball is buying time to cock or reload his gun. Alternatively Cueball is implying the missing carry caused the shown situation, and Cueball is monologuing (albeit a very short monologue), which may also serve to explain to the audience how his victory was achieved. Such an explanation would likely be necessary, as it is difficult to imagine any situation where this would be the case. A fourth way to explain the situation is that Cueball is stating with this phrase, that his opponent overlooked something small but critical, leading to a non anticipated (wrong) outcome. In this case his opponent would have overlooked that Cueball is carrying a gun, yielding to an unexpected and unfortunate outcome of his knife attack.\n\n;Looks like the Fed just lowered the interest rate.\n:[[Ponytail]] is standing on a desk with documents on it, probably in a banking or business related environment, dominating [[Cueball]] in a sword fight. The {{w|Federal Reserve System}}, usually referred to as The Fed, is the central banking system in the United States. The interest rates are usually lowered during a recession or a crisis, to revive the economy by providing businesses with cheap money. The dropped rates correlate with his chances to win and reflect his troubled situation.\n\n;Guess you should've scrolled ''all'' the way to the bottom before clicking \"Agree.\" \n:A common feature encountered when registering for user accounts or installing software is a very lengthy {{w|Terms of service}} document, describing the things you agree to abide by. The vast majority of people simply click Agree without reading the document, essentially agreeing to anything and everything that the author decided to include, which sometimes leads to things like [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/17/gamestation-grabs-souls-o_n_541549.html giving your immortal soul to a company]. In the context of this panel, perhaps the user agreed to be executed at random. \n\n;Bangarang, motherfucker. \n:This phrase is very similar to the line \"Yippee-Ki-Yay motherfucker\" used by {{w|John McClane}} in the ''{{w|Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard}}'' series. {{wiktionary|bangarang|Bangarang}} is, among other things, the Jamaican word for \"uproar.\" It was popularized (without the addition of 'motherfucker') as the cheer of the {{w|Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|lost boys}} in the film ''{{w|Hook (film)|Hook}}'', via the popular dubstep Skrillex song {{w|Bangarang|”Bangarang”}}.\n\n;Upgrade to the latest version of Adobe Flash player to view THIS content, bitch.\n:This title text is another suggested one-liner phrase, referring to an update reminder that would frequently pop up when one attempted to view visual media content on a webpage. After delivering the line, the character triggers a detonator (Double colons are sometimes used in text to denote an action), presumably setting off an explosive of some kind. \n:The phrase states that you need the latest {{w|Adobe Flash}} player to view this (presumably for older flash players too spectacular) explosion. \n:Also wordplay is involved since a \"flash\" is one visual representation of a explosion.\n:Of course, in real life, one doesn't need a \"flash player\" to view an explosion,{{Citation needed}} especially due to its [https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html official end-of-life] at the end of 2020 rendering the software completely defunct.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Probability of phrases becoming action movie one liners:\n:[Panels are arranged from More Likely on the left to Less likely on the right.]\n\n:[A woman points a gun down at Cueball who is on the floor, his gun just out of reach.]\n:Woman: ''You're'' going down the memory hole now, asshole.\n\n:[Man on ground points gun up at blade-armed man standing next to a board with science on it.]\n:Man with gun: ''Hey!'' You forgot to carry the two.\n\n:[Ponytail on desk points sword at man standing on floor.]\n:Ponytail: Looks like the Fed just lowered the interest rate.\n\n:[Cueball with gun looks down at Megan slumped on floor.]\n:Cueball: Guess you should've scrolled ''all'' the way to the bottom before clicking \"Agree.\"\n\n:[Megan holds pistol to the back of the head of Ponytail holding a rifle.]\n:Megan with pistol: Bangarang, motherfucker.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
