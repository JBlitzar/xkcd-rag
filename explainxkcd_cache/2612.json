This comic shows a lightsaber fight starting between two [[Cueball]]-like Jedi, one already presenting their blade in challenge and the second activating theirs in response. When the first strike is made between the two lightsabers, they meld together with a bloop sound, like the beams are made of a liquid. The two light beams then remain stuck to each other.  In in-universe \"technical documents\", lightsabers are said to be made from magnetically-confined plasma, so perhaps the magnetic fields which were projected from each hilt have merged instead of repelling (or presenting as mutually impervious) as is usually expected.\n\n(This scene actually looks a lot like what happens between Harry Potter and Voldemort's wands in the end of the fourth book, the {{w|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|''Goblet of Fire''}}. In that scene, two spells hit each other and connect the two wands, the wand holders then unable to release or disconnect the wands.)\n\nFirst the left Jedi, then the right, shakes the hilt, trying to break the bond. When this does not succeed, the right Jedi then deactivates his lightsaber in an attempt to end the connection. This causes the retraction of the entire double-sized light beam into the handles (as seen in the movies), causing both of the Jedi to be drawn together until their heads bonk, forcefully enough to render them both unconscious. The connected lightsaber handles lie next to them on the ground.\n\nThe title text implies that such events are how {{w|Jedi}} romances start, comparing it to the famous \"spaghetti scene\" from the 1955 Disney animated movie ''{{w|Lady and the Tramp}}'' where the two titular characters unintentionally kiss after sharing a strand of spaghetti.  In the Old Republic, Jedi were forbidden from entering into romantic relationships (and discouraged from forming attachments in general), but in the pre-Disney ''Star Wars Legends'' continuity of the {{w|Star Wars in other media|Expanded Universe}}, {{w|Luke Skywalker}} and {{w|Mara Jade}} first met while fighting in the aftermath of the fall of the Empire, and then developed a romantic relationship.\n\nStar Wars is a [[:Category:Star Wars|recurring theme]] on xkcd, and lightsabers have been prominently featured before in, for instance, [[1397: Luke]] and [[1433: Lightsaber]], where the problem with the physics of a light beam as a sword is shown. But in general light does not interact with light as {{w|photons}} are {{w|bosons}} and can thus pass through each other. Interference, yes, but two pure light beams cannot collide and bounce back as when two lightsabers collide. Also as the comic Lightsaber mentioned above shows, there is no compatible real-world way of confining a beam of light, making it stop after about a meter (or anywhere).{{Dubious}}<sup> - see {{w|Optical cavity}}</sup>\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cueball like Jedi are engaging each other in a duel using lightsabers over 12 panels of equal size, with sound effects as the only sound. In the first panel the left Jedi has his lightsaber extended holding it in both hand pointing towards the other, who at this time is just turning his lightsaber on.]\n:''Tssssss''\n:Click\n\n:[Almost same position of the Jedi, but the right Jedi's lightsaber has now extended, making a sound. He is holding it up near his head in both hands] \n:''Tsss''\n\n:[Then they run towards each other and swing their lightsabers towards each other, two small arcs indicating the swing of the lightsabers.]\n\n:[The two beams hit each other and connects at the middle in a big bloop of light, with drops of \"light\" jumping off both above and below the connected lightsabers. Both Jedi still holds on to their handles with both hands. A loud sound comes out of the connection:]\n:''Bloop''\n\n:[The Jedi stands still holding their handles. The beam is now forming a bow between the two handles.]\n\n:[The left Jedi violently shakes his handle causing a wave to travel down the beam towards the right Jedi.]\n:Shake shake\n\n:[The right Jedi shakes his handle and well and another wave travels the opposite direction towards the left Jedi.]\n:Shake shake\n\n:[Back to the bow of light between them, but the beam is visibly still shaking, but no wave is traveling any longer.]\n\n:[Same setting but the shaking has stopped. The right Jedi turns his lightsaber off on his handle with a sound:]\n:Click\n\n:[The beam of light is retracted quickly into the handle of the Jedi turning his lightsaber off. So quickly that the two Jedi, still holding on to their handles are pulled up in the air and towards each other as the sound of the beam turning off is heard. Lines indicate their movement and shadows on the ground beneath them indicate they are in the air.]\n:''Zhhhiiiip''\n\n:[When the beam is completely retracted the two handles collide and so do the heads of the two Jedi with a loud sound. They still hold on to their handles with both hands. They still hang in the air with shadows on the ground beneath them.]\n:''Bonk''\n\n:[In the final panel the two Jedi lie unconscious on the ground with their heads towards each other and with their arms stretched out towards each other. The connected handles lie between them.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]\n[[Category:Disney]]\n[[Category:Movies]]"
