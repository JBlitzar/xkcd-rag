The word empirical denotes information gained by means of direct observation or experiments. In this comic, Cueball completes the \"Will you marry me?\" experiment, by actually getting married (as opposed to deciding on the spot or taking time to think) and the results are \"yes\".\n\nThe word \"will\" has two meanings: auxiliary verb of the future and disposition to do something. In the first sense [[Cueball]] cannot answer this question since he cannot know the future. Of course the question ''Will you marry me?'' uses the verb ''will'' in the second sense.\n\nThis comic is likely a reference to [[Randall]]'s marriage around this time.\n\nThe title text states that Cueball is surprised by the results, suggesting that Cueball actually was not confident of his ability to marry, meaning that perhaps the marriage is not in good standing.\n\nThis is similar to [[1088: Five Years]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two people are standing together, Megan and Cueball.]\n:Megan: Will you marry me?\n\n:[Cueball throws his hands in the air excitedly.]\n:Cueball: Let's find out!\n\n:[The couple are now standing in front of an altar. A flower arch stretches over the couple and a person is standing behind the altar. Megan is wearing a knee length white dress and a veil. Cueball is wearing a bow tie. They are holding hands.]\n\n:[The couple stand together, still dressed from the wedding and still holding hands.]\n:Cueball: Apparently, yes!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Wedding]]"
