It came almost three years after the second [[1799: Bad Map Projection: Time Zones]] (#79) (3 years after the first). It was followed a year and a half later by [[2489: Bad Map Projection: The Greenland Special]] (#299).\n\nThe comic shows a {{w|map projection}} in which every continent and large island has just been replaced with a differently scaled and rotated version of the continent of {{w|South America}}, even though there is only one South America in the real world.{{cn}}\n\nBy [[:File:BadMapProjectionComparison.png|overlaying]] this map with the selection of map projections presented in [[977: Map Projections]], it seems that the \"underlying\" projection used here is the {{w|Winkel tripel projection}}, also used in [[2242: Ground vs Air]].\n\nThe comic is similar to joke map designs in which continents like Africa and South America have been swapped, or where someone will jokingly replace Greenland with South America. \n\nThe caption of the comic is a reference to the {{w|Cap'n Crunch}} cereal type that became a meme, [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oops-all-berries-box-parodies ''Oops! All Berries''], which has also been referenced in [[2719]]. \n\nInterestingly on the original South America, the archipelago or main island (hard to tell) of {{w|Tierra del Fuego}} is replaced with a small South America. In contrast, all other South Americas, including the one replacing the Tierra del Fuego, include it in their shape.\n\nThe title text claims that the map projection does a good job preserving distance and azimuth, the joke being that the distance and azimuth being preserved for the non-South America continents are those of South America and not the original continent. Note that for the map as drawn in the comic, while this is true for most of the larger landmasses, many of the smaller South Americas are distorted more significantly (such as the South Americas that replace New Zealand).\n\nFrom roughly left to right and top to bottom, the South Americas replace:\n\n*North America\n*3 SAs for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (possibly Victoria Island, Ellesmere Island, and Baffin Island)\n*Greenland <!-- Denmark? Danish Realm? -->\n*Iceland\n*Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, UK)\n*Great Britain, UK\n*Eurasia\n*Newfoundland, Canada\n*2 SAs for Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan\n*Africa\n*Taiwan\n*Cuba\n*Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti)\n*Puerto Rico, US\n*Jamaica\n*Sri Lanka\n*5 SAs for Luzon, Bicol Peninsula (southeastern Luzon), one ambiguous landmass (possibly Negros Island), Samar, and Mindanao; Philippines\n*Sumatra, Indonesia\n*Borneo (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei)\n*Sulawesi, Indonesia\n*2 SAs for New Guinea: one for Bird's Head Peninsula in the northwest of the island, and one for the rest of the island\n*Java, Indonesia\n*Madagascar\n*Australia\n*Tasmania, Australia\n*2 SAs for South Island and North Island, New Zealand\n*Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina and Chile\n\nThese are the 26 {{w|List of islands by area|largest non-Antarctic landmasses,}} plus 2 peninsulas of those landmasses, and 8 more islands.\n\nSee also related comics with map changes in comics [[1500: Upside-Down Map]] and [[1653: United States Map]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A map of the world, but every landmass has been replaced with South America, rotated and resized to roughly match the real landmasses they represent. South America is correct, except that the islands at the southern tip of the continent also have been switched to a small South America.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Bad Map Projection #358: Oops, all South Americas!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Bad Map Projections]]"
