Trick question--in North America, they're all names for the same species, Puma concolor! Isn't learning fun? Anyway, sleep tight!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall]] is giving reason number 58 why he should not have children. We see fictitious \"father [[Cueball]]\" talking about the Wikipedia entry for \"{{w|List of fatal cougar attacks in North America}}\". As stated, many of the victims were young children near their home.\n\nIf you tell a child about something dangerous, but without giving them necessary context to feel protected from it, you are likely to cause nightmares, sleeplessness, or other fear-related issues. In most, if not all, cases this would be considered bad parenting,{{Citation needed}} hence a person who enjoys doing so should perhaps not have children.\n\nThe title text demonstrates that not only is Cueball sharing factual information, he is intentionally adding hypothetical detail (e.g. \"yellow eyes glinting in your window\") to make the danger seem even worse. The child is unlikely to agree that learning this is fun. Incidentally, a panther is not an actual species but rather a term for either leopards or jaguars with melanistic conditions. Mountain lions themselves are rarely called panthers.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a computer; a child is standing behind.]\n:Cueball: Whoa, ever seen Wikipedia's list of people who were attacked and killed by cougars?\n:Cueball: Crazy how many of them were kids who were just playing outside their houses.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Reason #58 I should never have children: My love of learning and sharing knowledge about the world.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
