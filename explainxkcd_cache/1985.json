Hey, when we say 12pm, does that mean the hour from 12pm to 1pm, or the hour centered on 12pm? Or is it a snapshot at 12:00 exactly? Because our 24-hour forecast has midnight at both ends, and I'm worried we have an off-by-one error.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nAlthough we’re constantly exposed to them, many (most?) people don’t understand the details of how to properly interpret weather forecasts. But even beyond the normal questions, there can be much more complex issues hiding beyond those (though most people will not care for those). This comic takes this to the ridiculous extreme of the weather reporters coming from some other profession where you look into those questions. It shows questions asked by three different people with different backgrounds: {{w|mathematics}}, {{w|linguistics}}, and (in the title text) {{w|software development}}. While some of those questions have actual answers (which you'd expect someone working in that job to know, such as the definition of \"scattered showers\" and how it's determined, what a \"chance of rain\" means, and so on), each professional finally ends up with questions that are almost disturbing in how they cannot be answered. (So management ends up calling security to remove those announcers.)\n\nIt should be pointed out that hiring someone without any meteorological training to read the weather does not make them an actual meteorologist, no more than say hiring a bricklayer as a doctor would actually make them a real doctor.\n\n===Questions from the pure math meteorologist===\n\nThe first meteorologist, [[Cueball]], has a background in pure math. His forecast states that each of the next five hours has a 20% chance of rain. As a mathematician he sees how limited that information is. There is no information about whether or how those {{w|Probability|probabilities}} are {{w|Correlation|correlated}}. This becomes obvious if you ask the question \"How likely is it to rain this afternoon\" (a question even some non-mathematicians might be interested in). [[Cueball]] states that he does not know (as no one only getting the information about 20% rain in each hour can know). And then lists some scenarios that all fit the description, but have totally different results for \"How likely is it to rain this afternoon?\"\n\nThe first thing a mathematician would ask (and [[Cueball]] does here) is asking if those 5 events are {{w|Independence (probability theory)|independent}}. Events are independent if the outcome of one of them is unrelated to the outcome out of the others, i.e. knowing whether it rained at 3&nbsp;pm has no effect on whether it rains at 4&nbsp;pm, in which case the probability of any rain over the 5 hours is 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;0.2)<sup>5</sup> = 67.2%. (Rain is very seldom independent, as usually having rain in one hour increases the chance to rain in another hour, as systems of rainy weather usually persist for many hours). Another common extreme in probability theory is a set of {{w|Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive}} events. In this example that would be the scenario that the chance of rain is 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;20% = 100%, but it will only rain in exactly one hour and not rain at all for the other four. (Also possible but quite unlikely). This is what the mathematician was referring to by, \"Is rain guaranteed and we're just unsure of the timing?\"\n\nIn the second panel he continues to discuss what scattered showers means. Like most of the other weather terms in this comic, the term \"scattered showers\" is one whose technical definition is largely unknown but appears simple enough that most people would assume they understand what it means. \"Scattered\" refers to when the rain covers roughly 30–50% of the area at a given moment. To somebody who doesn't know this, like the first meteorologist, there's still the very valid question of how likely it is to rain in a specific spot (is it 30–50% of the total probability, or is it more than that because showers move and sweep out a larger area?), and how this is affected by the previous chance of rain. Not to mention, the percentage that defines \"scattered showers\" implicitly assumes a surface area that is accounted into the percent. Cueball rightly asks clarification on how large the location used to determine \"scattered showers\" is.\n\nWhile the all but the last question of the first part of the second panel can be answered by looking up their definitions, the last one is \"What if you have two locations you are worried about?\" This is an extremely complex question. Because there is no chance at all to answer this question from the answers of the previous questions or even from most other data a forecast might usually produce. To answer this you'd need the raw data from the ensemble forecast in order to specifically look at the correlation between weather at those two locations. Simply looking at the averaged result won't help.\n\nFinally in that panel Cueball begins to explain that he has asked the management about these things, but that they have stopped replying to his e-mails. At this point he spots the security guy coming over, and the screen goes black in to a technical difficulty screen that excuses this behavior to the viewers. It is implied that the security guy came over to force Cueball to leave the set, because he has been fired for confusing the viewers.\n\nQuestioning these things on air is likely confusing to the viewers, although they are all valid questions. But this may lose viewers and the news network is afraid of this. The technical difficulty panel further cements this, apologizing for hiring a person with a pure math background. Often seen as one that do not understand how to talk to regular people.\n\n===Questions from the linguist meteorologist===\n\nWhen they get back on air, the new meteorologist [[Blondie]] steps in. The management enquires (on air) to make sure she is not also a mathematician. She denies this but adds that she does have a linguistics degree, which the management thinks is fine, and thus believes they have prevented the same problem. However, Blondie quickly proves them wrong, as she goes into a linguistic tangent about the true meaning of the word \"it\" as referring to the weather. After one panel of this the management calls for security again.\n\nWhile, at the most basic level, human speech is broken into subject, object, and verb; for some reason in English we are capable of producing and comprehending speech without objects or verbs, but there is a certain \"resistance\" to speech without a subject. If you were in the passenger seat of a car and spotted some deer nearby, you could simply say \"Deer.\" rather than \"There is a deer over there\", deer being the subject of the sentence. However, if you noticed that it had begun to rain, you could not simply say \"Raining.\" on its own. Feel how that sentence just seems weird? Hence we have developed the tendency to use the filler word \"it\"; despite the fact that when we say \"It's raining.\", the \"it\" is not a reference to the clouds producing the rain, but the general state of the rainfall around us. (McWhorter, John. Understanding Linguistics: The Science of Language. https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/understanding-linguistics-the-science-of-language.html)\n\nThe first question is again quite harmless, and both possible answers (\"it\" being a {{w|dummy pronoun}} or referring to the weather) are valid answers, but the second question is much more disturbing.\nIn \"It's hot out, and getting bigger\" the first part of the sentence might be a dummy pronoun or it might reference the weather. But the second part breaks it: With a dummy pronoun \"getting bigger\" would be the impersonal action, which is not what is meant. It is referencing something (the hotness, that is getting bigger). But if the it references this entity in the second part, by grammatical rules it would also have to reference that in the first part. But \"The hotness is hot out\" makes no sense at all. (An alternative explanation is that the sentence is referring to the fact that if a dark (so as to absorb light energy from sunlight and convert it to thermal energy) object is placed outside in sunlight, it will heat up and undergo thermal expansion.)\nThis is again a common occurrence with informal speech: From a grammatical point of view, it is pure non-sense. But it still has meaning people understand. So if you want a proper descriptive grammar, it needs to cope with those cases. But then most such informal sentences would be special cases. (Case in point: What is the grammatical function of the \"out\" in that sentence?)\n\n===Questions from the software developer meteorologist===\n\nIn the title text, the news station has made the same error once more by hiring a software developer. The developer states concerns about the feasibility of the time system used to correlate to the weather patterns. Labels like \"12pm\" or \"1pm\" appear simple and clear, but because developers frequently have to deal with what these labels mean ''exactly'', the new meteorologist begins to wonder what time period is actually meant on a per-hour forecast. Does 12pm refer to the hour from 12 to 1pm, from 11:30am to 12:30pm, or only to the weather precisely at noon?\n\nThe software developer also worries about an {{w|off-by-one error}}, which is a common error in software development which occurs when boundary conditions include one element too few or too many. For example, when counting by 24 once every set period, it is common to forget whether the count should stop at 23 or at 24, especially if the number 0 (midnight) is included. In the 24-hour forecast, this means that there would be 25 hours represented every day, and these extra hours would add up and put the forecast one more hour off with each progressive day.\n\nThis worry is probably absurd because the inaccuracies would quickly build up and be noticed, and even if they weren't, the time would eventually be further into the future than the forecast models could supply. At least these concerns are less inane than the previous meterologists', but they are all things the developer should have asked ''before'' they went on the air.\n\n===Answering the meteorologists’ questions===\n\nManagement would certainly answer the mathematician's questions! The questions themselves have been asked of meteorologists before. The National Weather Service (NWS), a unit of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has published relevant answers for [https://www.weather.gov/ffc/pop probability of precipitation], as well as [https://www.weather.gov/bgm/forecast_terms timing and the meanings of particular forecast words]. The naming is also addressed [https://www.weather.gov/media/ajk/brochures/ConvectivevsStratiform.pdf here].\n\nRegarding probability of precipitation, NOAA forecasts give the probability that it will rain at all at any given point in an area. To rephrase it, it is the probability of rain occurring '''at all''' within a forecast area multiplied by the percentage of area affected by the rain. The \"forecast area\" is a clearly defined area of land and can be seen in the map of any official NWS forecast. [https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=34.0732&lon=-118.3963 Here is an example].\n\nRegarding the timing of the forecast, an hourly forecast gives the probability for each particular hour, stretching from the time listed to right before the next hour listed. So, the forecast for noon describes the time period from noon to 1pm. The forecasts for individual hours can be correlated; for this reason, the NOAA generates forecasts that stretch over longer time periods, giving a useful estimate for that time range. Thus, the chance of rain for \"Today\" specifically means: what is the chance of it raining at any given location during any time between 6am and 6pm?\n\nRegarding phrases like \"scattered showers\", this specifically means a 25-54% probability of precipitation from convective cloud sources. Other phrases, and when they are used, are detailed in [https://www.weather.gov/media/ajk/brochures/ConvectivevsStratiform.pdf the chart at the end of this PDF].\n\nSo, to conclude:\n\n* \"How likely is it to rain this afternoon?\" We don't know; you need to show the hourly forecast, not the 12 noon to 4pm forecast.\n* \"Is each hour independent? Correlated?\" Hourly values are given for that hour only. They can be correlated, hence why they can't be used to calculate the answer to \"How likely is it to rain this afternoon?\"\n* \"Is rain guaranteed and we're just unsure of the timing?\" You cannot tell from the data given. It's possible (though unlikely), that this is the case.\n* \"It says 'scattered showers.' Is this the chance of rain '''somewhere''' in your area?\" Yes, it is, and it means the rain will come from convective cloud sources with a probability of precipitation somewhere between 25 and 54%.\n* \"How big is your area?\" It's detailed in the forecast the mathematician would be reading from.\n* \"What if you have two locations you're worried about?\" Then all chances are off. While the other open questions like \"How likely is it to rain this afternoon?\" might have an answer management could supply, for this they do not really have any chance at all.\n* \"Hey, when we say 12pm, does that mean the hour from 12pm to 1pm, or the hour centered on 12pm? Or is it a snapshot at 12:00 exactly?\" It means the hour from noon to 12:59pm.\n* We have been effectively [[356|nerd-sniped]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is presenting a weather forecast while seated with his folded hands resting on a table.
