The idea is that, with nobody listening, he doesn't lose anything; if somebody ''is'' listening, however, he gains by freaking them out, which might cause them to reveal themselves and/or cease their activites. In this case, another Cueball-like surveillance man does get quite the shock.\n\nAs mentioned in the title text, this is similar to {{w|Pascal's Wager}}. {{w|Blaise Pascal}} was a French philosopher and mathematician who discussed the issue of the possibility that God actually does exist or not. According to Pascal, a rational person should live as though (a Christian) God exists, because he would lose negligible things if this turns out not to be true, but would gain immensely if it is true, by going to heaven in the afterlife. As Pascal himself recognized, this is not a proof of any god's existence, Christian or otherwise, but rather an inexorable choice made by every human being. Cueball makes a similar choice here, though hardly for such a moral reason.\n\nA similar joke was made in the {{What If|55|Random Sneeze Call}} article/chapter of [[What If?]], where [[Cueball]] picks up a phone after sneezing, only to hear someone say \"I know what you did.\" The difference, however, would be that in this comic, [[Randall]] ''will not'' be heard if he is wrong. If he calls a random phone number, he ''will'' be heard, even if he is wrong.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Game Theory Matrix of Cueball's Choice\n|-\n| || Nobody's spying on Cueball || Somebody's spying on Cueball\n|-\n| Cueball does nothing || Null outcome || Cueball is being spied on\n|-\n| Cueball claims to know<br>that they're listening || Only an omniscient observer<br>would be privy to the absurdity<br>of Cueball's actions || Cueball freaks out the spies\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Game Theory Matrix of Pascal's Wager\n|-\n| || God does not exist || God exists <!-- || ''Different'' god/gods exist -->\n|-\n| Atheism || Null outcome || Hell <!-- || Undefined, possible indifference -->\n|-\n| Faith || Wasted effort || Heaven <!-- || Undefined, possible punishment -->\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the two panels of the comic:]\n:Now and then, I announce \"I know you're listening\" to empty rooms.\n\n:[Cueball is sitting in an armchair, reading. He murmurs something unreadable.]\n\n:[A second Cueball-like surveillance man with headphones seems to have gotten up from his office chair so fast that is has fallen over and lies behind him. He is now standing in front of a large computer terminal with two screens. He can hear Cueball's mumble as it is shown as coming from one of the screens. The surveillance man is leaning back away from the terminal while holding a hand to his headphones.]\n\n:[Caption below the panels:]\n:If I'm wrong, no one knows. And if I'm right, maybe I just freaked the hell out of some secret organization.\n\n==Trivia==\n*This comic has a clear resemblance to the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby]] series. This would also make it clear that the Cueball in this comic is actually [[Randall]].\n*10 years later, Randall made a similar comic: [[2203: Prescience]].\n*See also [[628: Psychic]] for similar guess work to make you look cool.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
