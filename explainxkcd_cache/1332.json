But if you talk to hundreds of people every day and they all start expecting that same consideration, it could potentially add up to MINUTES wasted. And for WHAT?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn the comic, [[White Hat]] uses a fallacious argument to [[Cueball]] to justify being inconsiderate to people. He argues that if he expends minor effort being considerate to one person, he will be expected to be considerate to everyone he meets, which - he wishes to argue - is an undesirable situation. Thus, he justifies being inconsiderate as a form of avoiding the \"slippery slope\".\n\n\"{{w|Slippery slope}}\" argumentation is an informal fallacy that takes the form of \"if A happens, then B will follow as a minor but expected consequence. B will lead on to C, C leads onto D, and so on. Each consequence gets progressively worse until an undesirable situation is reached.\" A slippery slope argument proposes that A should not be allowed, because if it is, then the resulting chain of consequences will inevitably lead to the undesirable situation.\n\nThis idea is extended in the title text, where he continues extrapolating the train of thought to conclude that minutes of time would be \"wasted\". Rather than condemning the slippery slope fallacy per se, [[Randall]]'s point here seems to be more that White Hat's priorities are callous to the point of sociopathy. All people desire to be treated with consideration and respect,{{actual citation needed}} and taking a few seconds to acknowledge another's feelings is (for most well-meaning people) a small price to pay for improving that person's day, or at least not making it any worse than it needs to be. As such, these seconds would not be \"wasted\" at all, but would be actively making the world a friendlier place. White Hat's hyperfixation on not wasting time appears ludicrous given how much good feeling he could contribute to the world for so little of his own time. (White Hat also appears to be discounting the possibility that being considerate towards others will encourage reciprocity, which could result in SAVING him time since they will be more willing to help him out should he ever find himself in need.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat talking to Cueball.]\n:White Hat: Yeah, but if I'm considerate toward one person about one thing, what's next?\n:White Hat: Being nice to ''other'' people about ''other'' things?\n:White Hat: Where does it ''end?''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
