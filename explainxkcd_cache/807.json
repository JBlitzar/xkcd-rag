It just leads to the idea that either your love is pure, perfect, and eternal, and you are storybook-compatible in every way with no problems, or you're LYING when you say 'I love you'.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic criticizes our culture's tendency to romanticize young love (such as that portrayed in {{w|Romeo and Juliet}} and {{w|Titanic_(1997_film)|Titanic}}). Although young lovers do often have intense feelings for their beloved, for many of them, like [[Megan]] here, it is an infatuation based on little substance (such as a similar taste in music) and the mercurial gales of teenagersâ€™ minds rather than the real compatibility necessary for a long-term relationship. \n\nThe title text broadens this criticism to all forms of romance. Randall appears to be stating that it is possible to love someone even if your relationship with that person doesn't conform to the impossibly high standards of \"true love\" that {{tvtropes|OneTrueLove|our culture so highly exalts}}. In fact, healthy relationships are typically not perfect and [http://cmhc.utexas.edu/healthyrelationships.html require work, change, and compromise] rather than continual, effortless bliss.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan sits on a rock and Cueball sits on the grass.]\n:Megan: Seriously? ''I like that song too!''\n:Megan: I bet no two people in the history of the world have ever been so ''connected''!\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:I'm not sure why we romanticize \"young love.\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
