[[Cueball]] initially seems to have undergone something similar, as he describes a slide from his playground in a manner typical of such an experience. Instead, however, he finds that his initial perception was correct - the slide appeared large because it was actually extremely tall, not because his childhood self exaggerated its height. (As a child, it's roughly nine times his height; as an adult, it's only about triple.)\n\nThe title text references {{w|Aslan}}, a lion from ''{{w|The Chronicles of Narnia}}''. In ''{{w|Prince Caspian}}'', the fourth chronological book in the series, {{w|Lucy Pevensie}} tells him that he has grown since she last saw him. Aslan tells her that this is because she has grown; as she grew up, he grew in size to match her. Aslan is often regarded as a Christ figure, but since ''Narnia'' is a children's series, many readers don't realize this until long after they've read the books â€“ another instance of how perspective changes with age, and of the comic's title, \"subjectivity.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A tall slide, seen from the ground.]\n:When I was a kid, my school playground had a really tall slide that always made me nervous.\n\n:[A tall slide, seen from the side.]\n:We moved away, but the slide stuck in my memory, becoming a skyscraping monster.\n\n:[A car and a sign pointing to school zone.]\n:Years later, I was passing through my old town and remembered the playground.\n:I drove to the school to see the slide that my inner six-year-old thought was so towering.\n\n:[A huge slide, Cueball beside it.]\n:AND IT <u>WAS</u> HUGE!\n:I <u>KNEW</u> IT!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Chronicles of Narnia]]"
