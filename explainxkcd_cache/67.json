Nerd males are also typically represented as treating ''all'' women (including female nerds) with reverence and awkward fawning due to their supposed inexperience and lack of female company in comparison to other males. In the comic, the nerd girl uses this as an excuse for her social ineptitude.\n\nThe T-shirt the girl is wearing contains the text \"Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons,\" which is an [https://www.google.com/search?q=Do+not+meddle+in+the+affairs+of+Dragons,+for+you+are+crunchy+and+taste+good+with+ketchup&tbm=shop actual text] used for T-shirts, continuing with \"for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup!\" This text is a modified version of a quote from {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's}} {{w|The Fellowship of the Ring}}: \"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Girl with shoulder length brown hair and glasses, wearing a shirt which says \"Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons\".]\n:Girl: At least, thanks to your constant fawning, we have an '''excuse''' for our social ineptness. What's '''yours'''?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
