(See the [[#Trivia|trivia section]] regarding an on-line list of duos).\n\nIn this table, [[Randall]] describes a fictional {{w|Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe}} where the same names are used in different combinations — instead of Calvin, it is now Thelma (from the movie ''{{w|Thelma & Louise}}'') who is paired up with Hobbes, and Calvin is instead paired off with the King, from ''{{w|Anna and the King}}''. In all cases the one mentioned first on the list is also mentioned first in our universe, so it is always of the form Calvin and the King, never Calvin and Anna. There are 24 duos, and all 48 partners are mentioned (they go through four [[#Cycles|cycles]]). (In the title text of [[1644: Stargazing]] from the week before this comic, there is an indirect reference to parallel universes/{{w|multiverse}}).\n\nThe humor of this comic comes from the ridiculousness of the pairings, and the reader's imagination of the stories that are created with the pairs. See the whole [[#List of real duos|list of real duos]] as well as the [[#List of alternative duos|list of alternative duos]] below, with more detailed explanations.\n\nIn the title text, alternative movie ''Romeo and Butt-Head'' is mentioned, the fifth entry on the list. This is a combination of the famous {{w|Shakespeare}} play ''{{w|Romeo and Juliet}}'' and ''{{w|Beavis and Butt-Head}}''. ''{{w|Romeo and Juliet}}'' has been filmed many times; most recently in ''{{w|Romeo + Juliet}}'' from 1996 with {{w|Leonardo DiCaprio}} and {{w|Claire Danes}} in the leading roles. {{w|Butt-Head}} is the less stupid one (of the very stupid duo) from the animated TV series ''{{w|Beavis and Butt-Head}}'' (and a {{w|Beavis and Butt-Head Do America|film}}). As Romeo and Juliet is one of the best known love stories and Butt-Head is one of the most disgusting teens ever depicted on the big screen (only overtaken by {{w|Beavis}}), the combination could create disturbing pictures in people's heads (especially in the heads of anyone who may identify themselves with Juliet).\n\nIn the alternative universe, when this movie was released, it got the best possible review of two thumbs up from the critics ''Siskel and Oates''. {{w|Gene Siskel}} was paired with {{w|Roger Ebert}}, when they reviewed movies as the famous duo {{w|Siskel and Ebert}}. They were widely known for the \"thumbs up/thumbs down\" review summaries, with their best combined review being ''Two Thumbs Up'', one from each of them. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, they actually gave ''{{w|Beavis & Butthead Do America}}'' ''Two Thumbs Up''.\n\nIn the alternative universe Siskel and his partner gives the film a (surprising) two thumbs up, but Ebert has been replaced with Oates. This is a reference to John Oates of {{w|Hall & Oates}}, a famous American musical duo from Philadelphia.\n\nThere also exists a comedy duo named {{w|Garfunkel and Oates}}, formed by Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci, who chose the \"Garfunkel and Oates\" name by combining the second names from both ''Hall & Oates'' and ''{{w|Simon and Garfunkel}}'' (the latter duo is mentioned in the main comic). Although this exact combo would not be possible in the xkcd version, as the \"real universe\" combo takes the second names from two duos rather than the first name from one and the second name from another (as in this comic), there may definitely be a deliberate reference to this group as well which has taken the parallel universe idea into our universe.\n \n===List of real duos===\n*See the list of [[#List of alternative duos|alternative duos]] below.\n*In this list the ''partner index'' indicates whom the second from the duo is linked with in the comic\n**So in the case with Thelma (index 1) and Louise (partner index 3), this means that Louise is paired up with Batman (index 3).\n**Thelma is paired up with the Hobbes who has partner index 1.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|+ Famous duos in this universe\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | pairing\n! scope=\"col\" | Partner\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Explanation\n! scope=\"col\" | Name index\n! scope=\"col\" | Partner index\n|-\n| Thelma\n| and\n| Louise\n| ''{{w|Thelma & Louise}}'' is a famous road trip film from 1991.\n| 1\n| 3\n|-\n| When Harry\n| Met\n| Sally\n| ''{{w|When Harry Met Sally...}}'' is a romantic comedy film from 1989.\n| 2\n| 16\n|-\n| Batman\n| and\n| Robin\n| {{w|Batman}} and {{w|Robin (comic)|Robin}} are comic book characters (first appearance for Batman was in 1939, Robin the year after). There have been several {{w|Batman_in_film#Films|films}} including one called ''{{w|Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin}}'' from 1997.

They are known for their famous {{w|Who's on First}} sketch.\n| 12\n| 17\n|-\n| Dr. Jekyll\n| and\n| Mr. Hyde\n| Not really a duo, {{w|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde}} are the two sides of a well known character from the book ''{{w|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde}}'' written by the Scottish author {{w|Robert Louis Stevenson}} in 1886. It has been adapted into several {{w|Adaptations_of_Strange_Case_of_Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde#Film|films}}.\n| 13\n| 15\n|-\n| {{w|Samson}}\n| and\n| {{w|Delilah}}\n| Not really a duo, Samson and Delilah are Biblical characters from the {{w|Book of Judges}} (chapters 13-16). Samson was given supernatural strength by God in order to combat his enemies. However, Samson had two vulnerabilities: his attraction to untrustworthy women, and his hair, without which he was just a normal man. These vulnerabilities ultimately proved fatal for him when Delilah had him reveal the secret of his hair, which she subsequently cut off. Then she handed him over to be captured by the Philistines, who gouged his eyes out and brought him to imprisonment in Gaza. He died while in capture but on his own terms. Delilah had not explained why he was no longer strong, so his hair had been allowed to grow out again. When he got it all back, he used his power to destroy a temple he was led into, taking many enemies with him in death.\n| 14\n| 11\n|-\n| {{w|Butch Cassidy}}\n| and\n| the {{w|Sundance Kid}}\n| They are historical criminals who died in 1908. They were notorious American train and bank robbers with the {{w|Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch}} gang in 1899-1901. They were made famous by the film ''{{w|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid}}'' from 1969.\n| 15\n| 23\n|-\n| Bill\n| and\n| Ted’s Excellent Adventure<br>and Bogus Journey\n| {{w|Bill & Ted (franchise)|Bill & Ted}} are characters from the two films ''{{w|Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure}}'' (1989) and ''{{w|Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey}}'' (1991). The two titles are spread out on the two new pairings for Bill and Ted, in recognition that this duo is mainly known for these two films, although there also is a {{w|Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|spin-off animated series}} from 1990-1991.\n| 16\n| 6\n|-\n| {{w|David}}\n| and\n| {{w|Goliath}}\n| Not really a duo, David and Goliath were biblical adversaries best known from \"small\" David's defeat of giant Goliath in the story {{w|David#David_and_Goliath|David and Goliath}}. David later became the second king of Israel, according to the {{w|Books of Samuel}}, and according to the {{w|New Testament}}, an ancestor of {{w|Jesus}}.\n| 17\n| 8\n|-\n| {{w|Sherlock Holmes}}\n| and\n| {{w|Dr. Watson}}\n| Characters from {{w|Arthur Conan Doyle}}'s famous books (from 1887-1927) which have been made into numerous {{w|Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes#Film|films}}. In 2009 and 2011, a new {{w|Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|series of movies}} has been released with {{w|Robert Downey Jr.}} and {{w|Jude Law}} as the two characters. There have also been several TV series.\n| 18\n| 19\n|-\n| Jay\n| and\n| Silent Bob\n| {{w|Jay and Silent Bob}} is a strange duo from {{w|View Askew Productions|View Askew's}} film universe, first seen in the film {{w|Clerks}} from 1994. A film called {{w|Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back}} was later released in 2001. The director of these movies, {{w|Kevin Smith}} plays Silent Bob, who of course rarely speaks, but when he finally does it often becomes a long defining monologue. Jay (played by {{w|Jason Mewes}}) talks all the time!\n| 19\n| 18\n|-\n| {{w|Anna Leonowens|Anna}}\n| and\n| the {{w|Mongkut|King}}\n| Recently made famous by the 1999 film ''{{w|Anna and the King}}'', based on the 1944 novel ''{{w|Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|Anna and the King of Siam}}'' by {{w|Margaret Landon}}. The Langdon novel was based on two memoirs written by Anna Leonowens in 1870 and 1872, from her experience as royal governess for King Mongkut's children and language secretary for the King from 1862-1867.\n| 20\n| 21\n|-\n| {{w|Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes)|Calvin}}\n| and\n| {{w|Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)|Hobbes}}\n| ''{{w|Calvin and Hobbes}}'' is a comic series by {{w|Bill Watterson}} that ran from 1985-1995. Calvin is a six-year-old boy and Hobbes is Calvin's stuffed tiger and best friend, who becomes a living anthropomorphic tiger in Calvin's private fantasy world. They have been [[:Category:Calvin and Hobbes|featured regularly]] in xkcd, most prominently in the \"duo\" comic: [[409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic)]].\n| 21\n| 1\n|-\n| Timon\n| and\n| Pumbaa\n| {{w|Timon and Pumbaa}} are characters from ''{{w|The Lion King}}'' film (1994) and they also have their own {{w|The Lion King 1½|film from 2004}} and a {{w|Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|TV series}} that ran from 1995-1999. There have been [[:Category:The Lion King|many references]] to ''The Lion King'' in xkcd, for instance the comment in the final panel of [[1504: Opportunity]], is from the original movie.\n| 22\n| 14\n|-\n| {{w|Mary Kate Olsen|Mary Kate}}\n| and\n| {{w|Ashley Olsen}}\n| Known as the {{w|Mary-Kate_and_Ashley_Olsen|Olsen twins}}, these {{w|Twin#Dizygotic_.28fraternal.29_twins|fraternal twin}} actresses born in 1986 have been on TV since they were infants (on ''{{w|Full House}}'' from 1987) and began starring together in TV, film, and video projects, which enabled them to join the ranks of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age. They have previously been the pun of the joke in [[362: Blade Runner]].\n| 23\n| 13\n|-\n| {{w|Mario}}\n| and\n| {{w|Luigi}}\n| In the {{w|Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series of video games}}, which started with the 1983 game ''{{w|Mario Bros.}}'', Mario and his brother Luigi are the main characters. ''Mario'' games have been referenced in several xkcd comics, such as [[151: Mario]] and the comics in the {{w|''Mario Kart''}} [[:Category:Mario Kart|category]].\n| 24\n| 9\n|}\n\n===List of alternative duos===\n*See the list of [[#List of real duos|real duos]] above.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Famous Duos in a nearby parallel universe\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Duo name\n! scope=\"col\" | Explanation\n|-\n| Thelma&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hobbes\n| In this essay [http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/207623.html Political Philosophies in Thelma and Louise] the sentence ''Thelma and Hobbes's Total Sovereign Authority'' can be found. In this case it is a reference to {{w|Thomas Hobbes}} as the essay is an analysis of Thelma and Louise's actions and the decision they make in comparison to the political philosophies of Thomas Hobbes and {{w|Jean Jacques Rousseau}}. Hobbes was an English philosopher, best known today for his work on political philosophy. He also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought, which could be said to be relevant for the movie.\n|-\n| When Harry met Bullwinkle\n| {{w|Billy Crystal}} who played Harry in When Harry Met Sally... also has an uncredited cameo part as a mattress salesman in the movie {{w|The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle}} (see the list of uncredited actors on [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131704/combined IMDb]). In this real action movie,  Rocky and Bullwinkle ends up in the real world, where it thus becomes likely that Billy who played Harry ends up meeting Bullwinkle \"in real life\".\n|-\n| Batman and Louise\n| This duo's name comes rather close to the real duo {{w|Clark Kent}} and {{w|Lois Lane}} especially since the film {{w|Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice}} was set for release three weeks after the release of this comic in February 2016.\n|-\n| Antony and Robin\n| There is a book called ''[http://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Antony-Cleopatra-English-Literature/dp/0713155884 Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\"] written by a Robin Lee.\n|-\n| Romeo and Butthead\n| It would be quite a different story if either Butt-head should replace Juliet or if Romeo should replace Beavis... (Note Butt-Head is spelled with a hyphen, but has been misspelled in the comic.)\n|-\n| Bonnie and Ted's excellent adventure\n| There was not much excellent about the adventure for Bonnie as {{w|Ted Hinton}} was a Dallas County, Texas, deputy sheriff, the youngest of the posse that ambushed and killed Bonnie and Clyde in 1934. That they could have had an excellent adventure in an alternative universe becomes clear from this segment from his history on Wikipedia: \"Ted Hinton was also once acquainted with young Bonnie Parker while she was working in Marco's Cafe in Dallas. Because of her good looks, many of the male customers would flirt with her. Hinton was always gentlemanly and treated Bonnie with respect. Hinton admitted in a later biography that he had a crush on Bonnie, which made it difficult for him as one of the men on the team sent to kill her and her lover, Clyde.\"\n\nThe idea of Bill and Ted seeking out Bonnie and Clyde as part of their time-traveling history project is not too out-there, as they already pick up outlaw Billie the Kid in our universe.\n|-\n| Pinky and Clyde\n| As can be seen in the table above this refers to Pinky the mouse from Pinky and the Brain and Clyde from Bonnie and Clyde. But {{w|Ghosts (Pac-Man)#Pinky|Pinky}} and {{w|Ghosts (Pac-Man)#Clyde|Clyde}} are also the names of the pink and orange {{w|Pacman}} ghosts in this universe. They are, however, not a duo as there are {{w|Ghosts (Pac-Man)|four ghosts}} ({{w|Ghosts (Pac-Man)#Blinky|Blinky}} and {{w|Ghosts (Pac-Man)#Inky|Inky}} being the two others).\n|-\n| Simon and Goliath\n| Goliath begins with G as Garfunkel. Simon was the shorter of the duo thus fitting as David vs. Goliath.\n|-\n| Beauty and Luigi\n| No direct relation to either Mario or the Beast.  However, each story has had a less-popular adaptation that takes place in the sewers of New York City: the 1993 {{w|Super Mario Bros. (film)|''Super Mario Bros.'' film}} and the 1987-1990 {{w|Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|\"Beauty and the Beast\" TV series}}. Of course, Mario and Luigi are beast hunters rather than beasts.{{citation needed}}\n|-\n| Beavis and the Beast\n| Beavis starts with the same three letters as Beauty, just like Beast does.\n|-\n| Rocky and Delilah\n| There is a book called ''[http://www.bensonink.com/delilahsdaughters.html Delilah's Daughters]'', by Angela Benson, where Delilah Monroe's (note the closeness to Munroe) late husband is called Rocky. (See also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsIvBLuiiRs Rocky and Delilah] on YouTube...)\n|-\n| Abbot and Cleopatra\n| Abbot starts with an A as does Anthony. Cleopatra starts with a C as does Costello.\n|-\n| Dr. Jekyll and Ashley Olsen\n| In the Robert Louis Stevenson story, Dr. Jekyll has a sinister alter-ego in Mr. Hyde just like twins are (almost) the same persons. Though the Olsen twins are not {{w|Twin#IdenticalTwins|identical twins}}, as children the two shared the role of Michelle Tanner on the U.S. sitcom ''Full House''. Jekyll and Hyde are two people in one body, while Mary Kate and Ashley were, in a way, one person in two bodies. There are only three switches in this cycle. Butch Cassidy takes Mr. Hyde and the other Olson twin takes The Sundance Kid. This means that both twins are paired with a man instead of as in real life with a woman. The idea of Dr. Jekyll's secret evil alter-ego being a teenage girl is very silly.\n|-\n| Samson and Pumbaa\n| Samson has several letters in common with Timon but Samson is a huge man where Timon is a very small animal compared to the other main characters in The Lion King film.\n|-\n| Butch Cassidy and Mr. Hyde\n| As per the above explanation for Dr. Jekyll and Ashley Olsen, this outlaw and murderer duo might be considered the Olsen sisters.\n|-\n| Bill and Sally's Bogus Journey\n| In this [http://www.rogerwhitney.com/casestudy/ case study] regarding retirement we ''meet Bill and Sally'' (as Sally met Harry). It could be said to be a ''bogus journey'' as it is just a case study.\n|-\n| David and Costello\n| As Costello was the smaller of Abbot and Costello this does not match up with David vs. a Goliath as it did with Goliath vs small Simon.\n|-\n| Sherlock Holmes and Silent Bob\n| This is the only case of a direct switch between two duos. Dr. Watson usually listen to the musings of Sherlock Holmes and Silent Bob is, as his name indicates, mainly silent. Jay talks all the time.\n|-\n| Jay and Dr. Watson\n| See explanation above for their respective real universe partners (the only case of a direct switch between two duos).\n|-\n| Anna and the Brain\n| The Brain desires to take over the world; the King is ruler of his domain.\n|-\n| Calvin and the King\n| Although it is Calvin's fantasy that decides what happens, it is Hobbes that behaves like the King in their relationship at least when it comes to displaying physical strength to determine who decides.\n|-\n| Timon and Garfunkel\n| Timon is put together with Garfunkel, which makes it a close match to Simon and Garfunkel.\n|-\n| Mary-Kate and the Sundance Kid\n| See above explanation for Dr. Jekyll and Ashley Olsen.\n|-\n| Mario and Juliet\n| Mario would have no issue with balconies. His name has some similarities with Romeo. Also, like Romeo, he is an Italian stereotype.\n|}\n\n===Cycles===\n*There are four cycles.\n*The cycles listed below are sorted like explained this example from the longest cycle:\n**It starts with \"Thelma\" (from Thelma and Louse), who is paired with \"Hobbes\". Hobbes is then shown diagonally down in the next entry below, Calvin and Hobbes, thus leading from \"Hobbes\" to \"Calvin\", who is similarly paired with \"the King\" leading to Anna and so on, until \"Batman\" is paired with \"Louise\", completing the cycle.\n* First cycle: length 15\n    Thelma & Louise\n    Calvin & Hobbes\n    Anna   & the King\n    Pinky  & the Brain\n    Bonnie & Clyde\n    Bill   & Ted\n    Harry  & Sally\n    Rocky  & Bullwinkle\n    Samson & Delilah\n    Timon  & Pumbaa\n    Simon  & Garfunkel\n    David  & Goliath\n    Abbot  & Costello\n    Antony & Cleopatra\n    Batman & Robin\n\n* Second cycle: length 4\n    Romeo  & Juliet\n    Beavis & Butthead\n    Beauty & the Beast\n    Mario  & Luigi\n\n* Third cycle: length 3\n    Dr. Jekyll    & Mr. Hyde\n    Mary-Kate     & Ashley Olsen\n    Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid\n\n* Fourth cycle: length 2\n    Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson\n    Jay             & Silent Bob\n\n* Assigning an index starting with 1 (= Thelma & Louise) to 24 (= Mario & Luigi), they can be written as:\n\n    (1, 21, 20, 7, 6, 16, 2, 11, 14, 22, 8, 17, 12, 4, 3)\n    (5, 10, 9, 24)\n    (13, 23, 15)\n    (18, 19)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:Famous Duos in a nearby parallel universe\n\n:[A list with 24 duos with a gray “and\" between the two names (in one case it is a “met\") and three times there is a gray word before (once) or after (twice) the names.
