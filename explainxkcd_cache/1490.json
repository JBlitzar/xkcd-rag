In this comic, [[Megan]] is preparing a sample of what appears to be some mineral for {{w|elemental analysis}}. It seems to be some kind of {{w|silicate}} containing a small amount of {{w|iron}} (a common example of this would be {{w|red sandstone}}), and she is running a test to see if it contains {{w|beryllium}} (a rarer element whose best-known natural form is as a component of {{w|emerald}}).  Such analyses typically involve many instruments and steps to prepare the sample.  However, Beret Guy seems to be able to identify all the elements the substance is composed of just by eyeballing it, making him perhaps the perfect elemental analysis instrument.\n\nTo confirm this, Megan asks Beret Guy what he sees when he looks at her face, expecting that a normal person would describe the arrangement of colors and features that they see. Since Beret Guy sees the atoms Megan is composed of (mostly {{w|Composition_of_the_human_body|oxygen, carbon and hydrogen}}) he only notices the unusual atoms. In this case he sees the metal atoms her {{w|Dental_restoration#Materials_used|dental fillings}} are composed of. This shows his \"atomic vision\" extends beyond the surface of the substances. Megan finds this bizarre and asks Beret Guy what is wrong with him. He states that he has always suspected he contains too much {{w|zinc}}, which he believes makes people think he is weird, thus missing Megan's point: what is weird is not Beret Guy's elemental content, but his ability to apparently see everything as atoms sorted by element. He even describes himself as having \"too ''many zincs''\" rather than \"too ''much zinc''\", i.e. he's thinking of it in terms of discrete atoms.\n\nHigh zinc intake ({{w|Zinc toxicity|zinc toxicity}}) can cause nausea, vomiting, pain, cramps and diarrhea. It also reduces copper absorption, which affects the immune system. However, it does not grant superhuman sensory abilities.{{Citation needed}} That is solely a function of [https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tin tin].\n\nThe comic continues the theme of Beret Guy's naive misunderstandings of scientific terminology turning to be literally true.  In a previous [[1486: Vacuum|comic]] his misinterpretation of the notion of energy in the vacuum resulted in him gaining significant superpowers.\n\nIn the title text, the concept is taken even further: Beret Guy found his dad indistinguishable from a dog.  This is likely because all mammals are essentially made of the same basic elements.  Absent a distinguishing element from either his dad or the dog, they would appear to be the same.  He could, however, apparently distinguish his mother because she contained {{w|plutonium}}.  This is a very unusual occurrence; a human body should not contain more than a few atoms of plutonium, based on its natural synthesis, and those should be roughly the same in all bodies. Some possible explanations are:\n#She had an {{w|Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG}}-powered pacemaker (a few hundred were made in the 1970s).\n#She lived near Los Alamos during the second world war and was a member of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20241211130823/https://warisboring.com/the-scientists-who-pee-plutonium/ UPPU club (translated as “You pee Pu!”)].  Alternatively, she could have been exposed to another source such as {{w|radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant}}.\n#She was one of {{w|The Stepford Wives}} robots.\n#She was the victim of some unidentified, unethical medical experimentation. Such as {{w|Albert Stevens}}.\n#[https://web.archive.org/web/20060218071859/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Plutonium#Biographical_notes Archimedes Plutonium] was right all along, and she has some connection with him.\n#She actually eats plutonium. Why would we expect anything else from Beret Guy's mother?\nIt is also possible that Beret Guy's mother containing plutonium is probably intended as a whimsical explanation of his powers. The presence of plutonium in his mother may be the source of his own differences: radioactive exposure (in this case, potentially in utero) is a {{tvtropes|ILoveNuclearPower|common source of superpowers}} in comic books and other fiction (though unfortunately, this does not work in real life{{Citation needed}}). It's possible the plutonium is even in her womb, therefore basically guarenteeing his exposure to it.\n\nIt's not clear whether his mother's plutonium is related to his \"too many zincs\".  One explanation for Beret Guy having too much zinc could be that his mother's plutonium changed into zinc through the process of {{w|radioactive decay}}.\n\nIt is worth noting that the verbs \"recognized\" and \"had\" in the title text are written in past tense. This presents the possibility that Beret Guy's mother passed away due to {{w|radiation sickness}} from exposure to the radiation originating from the plutonium in her middle. This possibility is further evidenced when Beret Guy adds \"I never did ask her why...\", indicating that he may no longer have the opportunity to do so. This is further corroborated by [[502: Dark Flow]], where Beret Guy also appears to miss his mother.\n\nThe English physicist {{w|Henry Moseley}} discovered the law relating the {{w|atomic number}} of elements with their {{w|characteristic x-ray|characteristic x-rays}} when bombarded by free electrons, providing physical evidence for the {{w|periodic table}}, the {{w|Bohr Model}} of the atom and the concept of {{w|atomic number}}. In doing so he developed a method of identifying elements in a substance by bombarding them in a vacuum with electrons and using {{w|x-ray diffraction}} methods to measure the resulting X-rays. A famous French chemist brought him a complicated mixture of {{w|Rare Earth element|Rare Earth elements}}, many of which had only recently been discovered, to test his method. Within a short time, Mosley amazed the chemist by identifying all the elements by number using his method and referring to his chart to name them. This comic may therefore be subtly alluding to this method by suggesting that Beret Guy's eyes can fire electrons at anything he looks at and \"read\" the resulting X-ray radiation, giving him the ability to identify the composite elements in a similar manner.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands at a table and is preparing a sample for some kind of analysis in a device, when Beret Guy walks in.]\n:Beret Guy: What're you doing?\n:Megan: Testing a sample for beryllium.\n:Beret Guy: That? Yeah, there's a bunch of berylliums.\n:Megan: How do you know?\n\n:[Megan turns to Beret Guy who takes the sample and looks at it.]\n:Beret Guy: Look at it! See? Tons of oxygens and silicons, a few irons but definitely some berylliums too! Can't you see them?\n\n:[They continue to talk.]\n:Megan: No, I can’t see a list of the atoms in a thing by looking.\n:Beret Guy: How do you tell what things are?\n\n:[Zoom in on Megan.]\n:Megan: This is ridiculous. Look at me. What do you see?\n:Beret Guy (off-panel): You have tons of metal in your face. Lots of fillings, I guess?\n\n:[Megan stares at Beret Guy who takes a looks at his own arm.]\n:Megan: What's '''''wrong''''' with you?\n:Beret Guy: Too many zincs? I’ve always worried I had too much zinc and everyone thought I was weird.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150223192206/http://www.xkcd.com/ original version of the comic], there was a typo in the title text. It said \"form\" instead of \"from\".\n:When I was little I had trouble telling my dad apart form the dog. I always recognized my mom because she had a bunch of extra plutoniums in her middle. I never did ask her why...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Atom01]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
