This is a matter he has discussed in the comic [[:Category:Cancer|multiple times before]], with Randall being depicted as Cueball and his wife as Megan. At this comic's release, it had been 10 years since her diagnosis and treatments.\n\nThis comic is a continuation of [[1141: Two Years]] and [[1928: Seven Years]], which are shown in the first 16 panels, slightly grayed out.\n\nThe first of the new panels shows Randall and his wife at a \"Rabbit Rescue\", interacting with buns ([[:Category:Buns|a recurring theme]] of xkcd).  The purpose of such events is to get rescued (often surrendered or seized) rabbits or other animals used to interacting with each other and with unfamiliar humans under controlled circumstances, to help them be more suitable as pets and hopefully entice visitors to adopt them.  Randall facetiously asks his wife if she thinks the rabbits have socialized enough, even though he and his wife are there for the sake of their own enjoyment (and she indicates that she would like to spend more time patting a bunny on its head).\n\nIn the next panel, Randall is pushing his wife in a handcart, which is presumably stolen. (As evidenced by the off-panel person asking if anybody has seen the handcart.)\n\nThe third new panel shows Randall and his wife exploring a mountain. They appear to have found something interesting, due to Megan pointing her finger towards something off-panel. It appears to be a reference to a similar climbing scene from [[1190: Time]].\n\nThe fourth panel shows Randall and his wife sitting on the edge of a pier, looking at the night sky. This is a typical romantic nighttime activity. The panel is distinguished because there was considerably more effort put into the drawing of this panel than of the other panels, by virtue of it being nighttime. \n\nThe final new panels show Randall and his wife sitting on a hill, talking about how they couldn't believe that she would make it to 10 years cancer-free, which according to [[881: Probability]] wasn't all that certain (77% probability -- [[2379: Probability Comparisons|the probability of picking an M&M out of a bag at random and getting one that isn't blue]]). Randall's wife voices a concern that she had seemingly been carrying for a while, that she was a burden to Randall, and explains that she couldn't understand why he would marry her, except as a show of grace. Randall firmly rejects this notion, stating that it was no mere gesture, but that it was important to him that they enjoy \"whatever time we could have\".\n\nFinally, and as with the first comic in the series, the comic takes a light-hearted turn: because the table does not include values for probability of survival more than ten years after treatment, Randall's wife jokingly concludes that she is now immortal, perhaps thanks to a cursed artifact.  Many anniversaries are traditionally marked by giving gifts, such as the {{w|silver jubilee}} after twenty-five years of marriage (or of a monarch's reign, or an employee's seniority within a company, or anything else).  The tenth anniversary is traditionally associated with a tin gift (tin being a much more precious metal [https://www.bartleby.com/95/22.html in 1922] than it is today), but maybe Randall bought it at [[2376: Curbside|a cursed shop]].\n\nThe title-text expands on this final joke, as it suggests that there is an official name for this giving of cursed artifacts once the ten-year mark has passed. Also, it seems as though Randall has finally found [[1141: Two Years| a less-gross name]] for this anniversary than \"biopsy-versary\".\n\nCursed artifacts that cannot die were also mentioned in [[2332: Cursed Chair]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''From [[1141: Two Years]]'''\n:[Randall (drawn as Cueball) and Randall's fiancée (drawn as Megan) sit on a bed, Randall's fiancée is talking on the phone.

The guide is gesturing deeper into the cave while Randall and his wife are climbing down.]\n\n:[Randall's wife stands on a rock above an alligator in a swamp, photographing the alligator.  Randall is on a balcony behind safety railings.]\n:Randall: When they estimated your survival odds, I think they made some optimistic assumptions about your hobbies.\n\n:[Randall's wife sits on an examination bed, listening to a doctor holding a clipboard.]\n:Doctor: This is probably nothing. \n:Doctor: But given your history, we should do a full scan. \n:Doctor: We'll call with the results in a few days.  Try not to worry about it until then!\n\n:[Randall and his wife stand above a deep pond full of fish and other objects.  Randall's wife is piloting a wired underwater camera with lights.]\n\n:[Randall and his wife are standing next to each other.  Randall's wife has shoulder-length hair covering most of her face.]\n:Randall's wife: Hard to believe—six years ago, I was bald.

Randall and his wife sits, leaning back on their hands looking up, at the end of a pier going into a lake. The end is broader and they sit to each side of the middle of the pier. It is night and behind the lake there is a forest of pine trees. Above the three is a clear starlit night sky with hundreds of stars and the band of the Milky Way clearly visible. The trees and some of the stars are reflected in the water of the lake, distorted by the movements of the water.]\n\n:[Randall is sitting on a grassy field, a bit higher than his wife who lies on her back looking up.]\n:Randall: You did it.\n:Randall: Ten years.\n:Randall's wife: It doesn't seem real.\n\n:[Zoom in on Randall's wife, who is not longer lying down.]\n:Randall's wife: When they showed me my 10-year survival chart, I really didn't believe I would make it here.\n:Randall's wife: I don't understand why you married me when it looked so bad.\n:Randall's wife: But it was very sweet.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel Randall is standing in front of his wife, who is sitting on the ground, arm leaning on her bent knees.]\n:Randall: You make it sound like an act of grace, and not something I desperately wanted to do and was worried I wouldn't get to.\n:Randall: You're the coolest person I've ever met. I just wanted whatever time we could have.\n\n:[Same setting but seen from a distance and in silhouette. Randall's wife has lifted her fist towards the sky, and it seems like Randall has turned away from her looking up.]\n:Randall's wife: Well, good news, my hideous and inexplicable existence continues unabated!
