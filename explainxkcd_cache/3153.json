Considering that the majority of passenger-carrying balloons use hot air, the specificity of the term “air balloon” could be taken to imply that there is another variant that uses something hot other than air. (\"Hot air\" should rather be considered as a compound term, in contrast to, for example, hydrogen or helium-filled balloons.) {{w|Water balloons}} are typically relatively small, sealed (unlike hot air balloons, which are open at the base), full of cold water, and intended to be thrown in a water balloon fight, a common way to have fun and cool down during hot weather. This comic combines the hot air balloon and the water balloon to create a “vehicle” consisting of a basket attached to a large balloon of heated water.\n\nSuch a balloon would float in cooler water, but not in air, unless its contents were heated so strongly that the balloon was filled with steam (i.e. water in gaseous form). A balloon filled with superheated steam could work, in principle, and, in fact could theoretically produce more air lift than a hot air balloon, as steam is less dense than air at the same temperature and pressure, but there are many practical reasons why such a balloon would be difficult to build and operate, and multiple safety concerns involve when working with steam.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\nThe title text clarifies that the hot water balloon is not just useless, but actually dangerous, as it has a large container full of hot, pressurized water, naturally leading to accidents. However, the {{w|National Transportation Safety Board}} (NTSB) doesn’t consider the stationary hot water balloon to be a form of {{w|transportation}}, since it doesn't move, and thus they claim any hot water balloon accidents should not fall under their purview. Considering that it is probably a business, hot water accidents would be usually reported to {{w|Occupational Safety and Health Administration}} (OSHA) instead, under criteria for [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/pdfs/2016-106.pdf Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments]. This title text is similar to that of [[3131|3131: Cesium]] which also expressed a goal of causing an agency to investigate outside their usual purview.\n\nThis comic could have been inspired by the {{w|Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta}}, which was being held in New Mexico during the time of posting.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A large water balloon is sitting on the ground, with cords connected to a basket nearby with Cueball and Megan inside. The water balloon's color patterns are like a hot air balloon's. Ponytail is poking the balloon with a finger, and a squirrel is on the ground looking at the basket.]\n:[There are squiggly heat lines ({{w|The_Lexicon_of_Comicana#Examples|indotherms}}) emanating from the balloon, as well as movement lines ({{w|The_Lexicon_of_Comicana#Examples|agitrons}}) above the balloon. Above them it says:]\n:bloop bloop\n\n:[Caption below panel:]\n:Hot water balloon rides turn out to be significantly less romantic than the air kind.\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
