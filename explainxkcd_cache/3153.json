Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n{{w|Hot air balloons}} are an [[2940|inconvenient and dangerous]] form of novelty transport in which riders float into the sky in a basket suspended from a large balloon filled with hot air. Considering that the majority of passenger-carrying balloons use hot air, the specificity of the term “air balloon” implies that there is another variant that uses something other than air, as with helium-filled balloons (which float) and water balloons (which don't). {{w|Water balloons}} are typically relatively small, sealed (unlike hot air balloons, which are open at the base), full of cold water, and intended to be thrown in a water balloon fight, a common way to have fun and cool down during hot weather. This comic combines the hot air balloon and the water balloon to create a “vehicle” consisting of a basket attached to a large balloon of heated water.\n\nSuch a balloon would float in cooler water, but not in air, unless its contents were heated so strongly that the balloon was filled with steam (i.e. water in gaseous form). A steam-filled balloon would produce more lift than an air-filled balloon of the same size and temperature, since the molecular weight of water is less than the average molecular weight of air, but would have new problems. Its high temperature would be dangerous to work with, and it would be necessary to construct the balloon of materials that would tolerate long-term immersion in steam. If any of the steam cooled below the boiling point of water, it would immediately condense, collapsing that part of the balloon; the buoyancy of the steam would be lost as the same weight of liquid water displaced less of the air outside the envelope. The nearly-boiling water would be an additional hazard to nearby people. To reduce the constant loss of heat from the balloon, with resulting condensation, it would be necessary to insulate the balloon, which would increase its weight, and therefore reduce its carrying capacity.\n\nThe title text clarifies that the hot water balloon is not just useless, but actually dangerous, as it has a large container full of hot, pressurized water, naturally leading to accidents. However, the {{w|National Transportation Safety Board}} (NTSB) doesn’t consider the stationary hot water balloon to be a form of {{w|transportation}} since it doesn't move, and thus they claim any hot water balloon accidents should not fall under their purview.\n\nThe concept of a hot water balloon derives additional humor because it reminds the reader of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_water_bottle hot water bottles].\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[A large water balloon is sitting on the ground, with cords connected to a basket nearby with Cueball and Megan inside. The water balloon's color patterns are like a hot air balloon's. Ponytail pokes the balloon with a :finger, and a squirrel is on the ground looking at the basket.]\n:[There are squiggly heat lines ({{w|The_Lexicon_of_Comicana#Examples|indotherms}}) emanating from the balloon, as well as movement lines ({{w|The_Lexicon_of_Comicana#Examples|agitrons}}) above the balloon. Above them it says:]\n:bloop bloop\n\n:[Text below panel:]\n:Hot water balloon rides turn out to be significantly less romantic than the air kind.\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>"
