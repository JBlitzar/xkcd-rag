I didn't stop and talk to her, and I've regretted it ever since.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe base part of the comic is self-explanatory: Girl attracts Boy, Boy notices Girl, Boy approaches Girl, Girl reacts positively, Boy falls in love, Girl decides to answer lovecall, happily ever after, etc. The quirk in this comic is that the way Girl catches attention of Boy is through the signature move of 1980s rapper {{w|MC Hammer}} (the slide). To watch MC Hammer doing the slide, click [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo#t=116 here].\n\nThe title text indicates that [[Randall]] once saw a girl go by and regrets that he did not speak with her as Boy does in this comic. It is possible that the girl Randall is referring to was actually doing the slide.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Hairy stand next to each other talking.]\n:Hairy: I just feel like somewhere out there is the girl for me.\n:Cueball: Yeah.\n:Hairy: Someone loving and caring.\n:Cueball: I know what you mean.\n:Hairy: A girl whose only mode of transportation is the M.C. Hammer Slide.\n:Cueball: Yeah.\n:Cueball: ...Wait, what?\n:[Megan hammer slides past.]\n:[Hairy sees Megan hammer slide and they stare into each other’s eyes.]\n:[Hairy approaches Megan.]\n:Hairy and Megan: ♡\n:[Megan hammer slides over into Hairy's waiting arms.]\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the first numbered comic that contains a dot (.) in the title.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
