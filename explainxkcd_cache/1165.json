The \"round 14\" suggest they are being compared in different criteria in a sort of competition. With such different systems, we can assume that most of those comparisons were similarly funny. The title text mentions two other criteria of comparison.\n\nThe measure of flow for the Amazon river (cubic meters per second) indicates the volume of water that passes a given area in the river at any second. To illustrate how much 220,000 cubic meters is, the comic shows a car parked next to 220,000 cubic meters of water. 220,000 cubic meters equals a cube with an edge span of 60.4 meters. By comparison the 0.9 cubic meters (900 L) of goods that are shipped by Amazon.com seems very small (note that 900 liters of goods per second is still a lot). To illustrate this size, the comic shows an Amazonian fish (or possibly an {{w|Amazon river dolphin}}) investigating the packages.\n\n{{w|Iquitos}} and {{w|Manaus}} are cities near the source and middle respectively of the river; the title text suggests that it is shorter to have a package shipped between the two than let it drift downstream. \"Minutes to skeletonize a cow\" refers to {{w|piranha}}, an Amazonian predatory fish with a popular reputation of being capable of the mentioned act when hunting in groups. (It should be noted that, while not fictional per se, the legendary cow-killing piranhas had been starved beforehand by local humans.)\n\nIn [[1599: Water Delivery]] Amazon.com delivers water, as a direct reflection of what the Amazon river actually achieves by default.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Round 14\n:Estimated outflow volume\n:in cubic meters per second\n:[A cube of water representing the outflow of the Amazon, with various marine life in it and people standing around it.]\n:Amazon 220,000\n:[A pile of boxes representing the outflow of Amazon.com, dwarfed by the large cube of water next to it.]\n:Amazon.com 0.9\n:Advantage: Amazon\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"
