Please, nobody ever say that.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|One-upmanship}} is the act of surpassing another person. In this case, one female character is one-upping her friend's claim of being taken on a mountain hike with a claim that she was proposed to.\n\nMario is the major figure in the {{w|Super Mario}} series. In the games, completing specific conditions causes a \"1-up\" to appear on screen, referring to an additional life. The comic relies on the homonym of the action of one-upmanship and the event of one-ups in Mario.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] says that this is a pretty bad joke (and also somewhat tasteless) and he doesn't wish to hear it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Megan: For our anniversary, my boyfriend took me hiking in the mountains.\n:Ponytail: My boyfriend proposed to me.\n\n:Ponytail: They should call you Mario, 'cause you just got <<1 up'd.>>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Video games]]"
