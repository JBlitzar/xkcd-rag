So that's a THIRD option I have to research!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic illustrates a common problem in the internet era where, with the wealth of knowledge available to us at all times, one puts undue weight on otherwise arbitrary decisions. \n\nThis is taken to a comedic extreme by showing how [[Cueball]] is unable to make a critical, time-sensitive choice without putting hours of research in to justify it. Any benefit to researching the imminent decision of \"which car will get us to our destination fastest\" will be more than offset by the time it takes to make that decision.{{Citation needed}} The inability to make a snap judgment in this case will prove very destructive as the bomb mentioned by [[Megan]] will now likely detonate before they get to the base. The difference in time/effort needed to steal either car is likely presumed to be insignificant to this scenario. \n\nIn the caption below the comic [[Randall]] gives the reader one of his [[:Category:Protip|recurring protips]]. In the tip, he reveals a weakness for his potential opponents to exploit. Randall admits to having the same problems with decision-making as Cueball, and suggests that if he were placed in an equally urgent situation testing his (in)ability to choose, he would fail just as spectacularly, as long as he had free access to the internet. As the old saying goes, \"give 'em enough rope, and they'll hang themselves\"; in this case, give Randall enough internet access, and he'll get caught in an indefinite research loop.\n\nThe title text continues this absurdity by bringing a third option to the table, the choice of inaction (which by wasting his time on calculations and research, Cueball has taken), a choice here that seems unacceptable, but the time spent mentioning (and researching it) simply adds to that already spent researching the two cars. Of course this option ensures that they are not killed when the bomb explodes, because they will not be anywhere close to the base. That might make it the only reasonable choice left after wasting so much time pondering which car to steal.\n\nThat not making a choice is also a choice has often been mentioned in literature and other places, like when the band {{w|Rush (band)|Rush}} in their song {{w|Freewill (song)|Freewill}} sings \"If you choose not to decide - you still have made a choice\".\n\nSupposing both of them know how to drive (and steal) a car and defuse the bomb, the best option in this situation is to leave the phone in the pocket and steal both cars, and see who gets there first to defuse the bomb. This would both ensure one of them reaches the base as quick as possible and at the same time resolve the problem of which car would be best for the problem. Of course that would also have defused the joke, [[No Pun Intended]]...\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are standing near two sport cars. Megan points excitedly at the cars while Cueball looks at his smartphone.]\n:Megan: There! If we steal one of those cars, we can get to the base and defuse the bomb!\n:Cueball: Hmm, the one on the left accelerates faster but has a lower top speed. \n:Cueball: Ooh, the right one has good traction control. Are the roads wet?\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:Protip: If you ever need to defeat me, just give me two very similar options and unlimited internet access.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The problem of choosing between cars with different accelerations and top speeds is the center of the car customization mechanic introduced in the seventh installment of the {{w|Mario Kart}} series. \n*It is known that Randall has played some version of the game, as it has become a [[:Category:Mario Kart|recurring theme]].\n*Although presented as a joke, this is a very real problem in electronics design. ''{{w|Buridanâ€™s principle}}'' by none other than {{w|Leslie Lamport}} [http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/buridan.pdf states]:\n::\"A discrete decision based upon an input having a continuous range of values cannot be made within a bounded length of time.\"\n*This is not the first time that Randall has made a comic that tells his readers how to trick him (or his friends) like in [[1121: Identity]], where he notes how to get his password from a friend.\n*In [[1445: Efficiency]] Randall describes why he is so inefficient (again, demonstrating the option 3 beautifully,) and in [[309: Shopping Teams]] two nerds out shopping have to choose between two similar objects and end up in a similar situation, though without a deadly deadline. \n*This was the first of two comics in a row where having access to the internet on a smartphone while out walking is a major part of the plot, the next being [[1802: Phone]], where Randall find that it is a problem that it is impossible to take a walk without being updated on his phones feed all the time.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Protip]]\n[[Category:Smartphones]]"
