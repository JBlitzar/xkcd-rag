The previous one was [[16: Monty Python -- Enough]], and the next one was [[18: Snapple]].\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic features a man and a woman in a romantic setting, surrounded by a {{w|fractal}} combination of love and doubts; an arrangement based on the {{w|Apollonian gasket}} construction. Three circles are drawn tangent to each other, then additional circles are added that are tangent to three existing circles (without overlapping), ad infinitum. [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] hadn't standardized his character designs yet, so it's hard to say if the comic features [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]] or [[Hairy]].\n\nIn the original caption, Randall reports that one of his best friends recently got engaged. The friends he's referring to are [[Scott]] and Sarah (probably the one from [[84: National Language]]), as [https://web.archive.org/web/20060529065522/http://xkcd-drawings.livejournal.com/4279.html he confirms in the comment section] for this comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A large black circle (drawn on grid paper) with white bubbles inside it, filled with hearts, question marks, and stick figure couples. The hearts are colored red.]\n:[Bottom left circle - stick figure couple with a heart]\n:[Top right circle - with couple:]\n:what if this isn't everything it should be?\n:[Two circles left of top-right:]\n:i'm not even sure how i feel\n:[One circle right of top-right:] \n:what if i'm making a mistake?\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the first xkcd comic featuring [[Scott]].\n* Randall's later blog and books have a name similar to this comic's, ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'', but it's just a coincidence.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 16]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Scott]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
