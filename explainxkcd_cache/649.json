The wrist strap provides a conduction path directly from one's skin to an {{w|electrical ground}}, preventing the buildup of {{w|static electricity}} which, if accidentally discharged upon touching part of a circuit, can damage sensitive electronic components.\n\n{{w|Condoms}}, on the other hand, are an important safety tool for sex, as {{w|birth control}} and protection from {{w|Sexually transmitted infection|STIs}}.\n\nThe last panel implies that in his confusion, Cueball put on a condom in order to replace the {{w|RAM}} in his computer the previous week. {{w|Geek Squad}} is the computer service department of the {{w|Best Buy}} chain of American electronics superstores. So Cueball implies that he put on a condom while working in Best Buy, for performing computer repair, and was fired for indecency.\n\nThe title text conveys the irrational{{cn}} belief that nothing can go wrong on a project while wearing an antistatic wrist band. In reality, the wrist band will only protect your electronics from {{w|electrostatic discharge}}, and there are plenty of other things that could go wrong on an electronics project, such as bad soldering, installing the wrong component, mechanical damage through excessive force (e.g. {{w|Blunt trauma|blunt force trauma}}) or even electric shock from an exposed live voltage. Or the text could be referring to even non-electronics projects, in which case the wrist band would really be pointless.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[It's pitch black. Only Cueball and Megan's dialogue can be seen.]\n\n:Megan: Hang on, I can't seeâ€”did you put on a condom?\n:Cueball: It's okay. I've got a wrist thing on.\n\n:Megan: A what? Let me see that.\n:''fumble''\n:Megan: This is an anti-static strap.\n\n:Cueball: You mean it doesn't...\n:Megan: No. Why would you even THINK that?\n:Cueball: I guess I was mixed up.\n\n:Cueball: Wait, so when I was replacing that RAM last week...\n:Megan: Yeah, I THOUGHT that was weird.\n:Cueball: Oh, but it explains why the Geek Squad fired me.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]"
