The mother and her ducklings will always walk in a line. The ducklings will either follow their mother, or the duckling in front of them.\n\n[[Cueball]] scares the mother duck, so she starts running away, her children following her in a line. Then [[Megan]] snatches the mother duck, leaving the first duckling to start following the last duckling, causing the ducklings to walk in a loop. Hence the caption at the end - \"Operation: Duckling Loop.\" However, eventually the ducklings will probably realize something has gone wrong,{{Citation needed}} and break the loop.\n\nThis behavior occurs naturally in real life with creatures that are less smart than ducks, such as sheep and ants (the phenomenon is called an {{w|ant mill}}).\n\nThe title text refers to a meme called \"Duckrolled\", where one would post a link to [http://www.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS9ZqD3N_DuAvMnN9Pl5k4Km6HCdCFXCLs3Gi4uJhge1ytfG3_qUgNU4To a picture of a duck on wheels.] It became much more famous in its later incarnation as the {{w|Rickroll}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A mother duck and her six ducklings.]\n:[Cueball is in front of the line of ducks, and Megan is behind.]\n:Megan: Ready?\n:Cueball: Ready.\n\n:[The duck and ducklings move.]\n\n:Cueball: ROAR!
