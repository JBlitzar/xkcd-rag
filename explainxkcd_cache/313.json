Better set the alarm to 'cinnamon'.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nSimply put, the narrator's insomnia, combined with small bright lights in an otherwise pitch-black room, is causing him to hallucinate. Furthermore, the narrator is well aware that he will be unable to distinguish the hallucinations from reality. This finally occurs when his clock reads 13:72, which would not be possible on any clock.\n\nA clock can never read \"72 minutes,\" as there are only 60 minutes in an hour. While a clock can read \"13 hours\" on a {{w|24-hour clock}} (which is common on most {{w|digital clock}}s in Europe, but not in the US), the thirteenth hour does not occur immediately after the fourth hour.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text shows that the narrator has indeed \"succumbed\" to his visions, and is assigning gibberish values — an alarm clock with a \"cinnamon\" setting, the time of day \"25 hours and 131 minutes,\" and \"levitation class\" — to an otherwise normal monologue.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[It is black, except a few blue and green lights, and red numbers from a clock.]\n:[The clock shows 4:31]\n:Lying awake at night I realize how many little lights there are in my room. The alarm clock is the brightest. Can't sleep I'm alone with those glowing red numbers\n:[The clock now shows 4:32]\n:Time slows\n:Does time even exist here?\n:Thoughts churning in on themselves\n:[The clock now shows 4:33]\n:The madness can't be far away\n:Ah yes\n:[The clock now shows 13:72]\n:There it is.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
