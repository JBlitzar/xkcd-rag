The technique is considered extremely dangerous, especially without supervision, as loss of consciousness can result in continued strangling which can quickly be fatal.\n\nIn the films, Vader possesses the ability to restrict the airway of anyone without having to touch them, using only the so-called \"{{w|Force (Star Wars)|force}}\". This practice has therefore been called force-choking. The comic assumes that Vader used this technique against himself, with the help of a mirror, in order to become sexually aroused.\n\nLord Vader has apparently force-choked himself to the point of unconsciousness (or possibly even death) and is being transported from his house on a stretcher by two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).\n\nThe title text is a pun on the term \"choking the chicken\", a colloquial expression referring to male {{w|masturbation}}. \"Force-choking the chicken\" might mean a technique of self-gratification by use of the \"force\" without having to apply one's hands.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two EMTs are rushing Darth Vader away from a front door on a stretcher.]\n\n:[There is a room with a desk in the foreground and a full-length mirror in the corner. On the desk is a laptop displaying the Wikipedia page for autoerotic asphyxiation.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThe sexual potential of the force choke was already explored in the title text of [[307: Excessive Quotation]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]"
