    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 2958\n| date      = July 12, 2024\n| title     = Hatchery\n| image     = hatchery_2x.png\n| imagesize = 239x336px\n| noexpand  = true\n| titletext = Anadromous fish are more vulnerable in rivers, since the lack of salt means you can quickly crack passwords using rainbow trout tables.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Remote code execution}} is a type of {{w|software exploit}} that takes advantage of a bug to allow a remote user of a computer application to make it run code that it was not intended to execute. For example, a webserver with such a bug might allow a user of a web page to make it run a program that deletes system files or displays private information.\n\nThe joke arising from this comic is that if you remove the \"e\" from \"code\", you get \"remote cod execution\". This refers to killing (\"executing\") {{w|cod|codfish}} remotely, using an exploit in a network application that allows one to view and interact with the {{w|hatchery}}.\n\nThe title text contains a pun on {{w|rainbow tables}}, referring to {{w|rainbow trout}}, one type of which ({{w|steelhead}}) is {{w|anadromous fish|anadromous}} (migrating up rivers to spawn -- {{w|salmon}} are another well known example). Rainbow tables are used when trying to crack hashed passwords; these are files with a carefully pre-computed selection of passwords and their corresponding hash values, which can be used to more efficiently recover passwords that are provided only in their hashed form. To prevent rainbow tables from being usable in this way, most modern password systems use \"{{w|salt (cryptography)|salt}}\" â€” an extra random string that gets appended to the password before hashing so the same password will potentially have many different hashes, and it becomes infeasible to recover it even with the acceleration offered by rainbow tables. An additional pun is that rivers contain fresh water, so there's no salt (the chemical kind) and the fish are therefore more vulnerable.\n\nThe comic dialogue itself starts the whole chain of puns off by using the phrase \"shooting fish in a barrel\", which is figuratively used to mean that the task is extremely easy, but here becomes clear that he is literally {{w|Capital punishment|executing}} fish, without needing to be there in person. Also, Black Hat has [[374: Journal|previously]] talked about shooting \"lonely, angsty fish in a barrel.\"\n\nIt might also be a pun referencing {{w|Call of Duty}}, as the game's acronym is \"COD\" and Black Hat is seen shooting something on a computer with a \"Blam!\". In this sense, \"remote COD execution\" could refer to running Call of Duty on the fish hatchery's computer equipment remotely, though this would then not make this scenario particularly reliant upon anything fish-related, rendering the rest of the puns less explicable.\n\n{{w|Fish (Unix shell)|fish}} is also the name of a {{w|UNIX shell}}. Shells are popular targets for computer hackers as they are capable of being used to run arbitrary commands if sufficient access is gained through them.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is sitting in an office chair at a computer desk, typing on the keyboard while looking at the screen. Cueball is standing behind him. From a star burst on the top of the screen a line goes up to a sound coming from the computer.]\n:Black Hat: Shooting fish in a barrel.\n:Computer: ''Blam!''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:A new fish hatchery exploit allows remote cod execution.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computer security]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Programming]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
