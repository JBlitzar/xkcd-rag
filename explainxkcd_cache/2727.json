In one, a particular TV show is being watched, in the other a film franchise.\n\nWhile it is finding its feet, a new season of a television show (perhaps commissioned, on the back of some perceived interest in the story it will tell, for a dozen or so episodes of around 50 minutes - i.e. about ten hours) is not necessarily going to get everything right in the writing style, the slant it puts on the subject matter, the cast of characters or other production values. Or at least not for mass appeal to the everyman, for whom [[Cueball]] is the archetypal representative. Nevertheless, many series ''do'' get further seasons and greatly improve.  [[White Hat]] (the optimist, and clearly won over by the production) is on the way to successfully convincing Cueball to view a particular series, or perhaps to continue to watch it after becoming jaded by its early failure to live up to its hype. It sounds reasonable to Cueball, just from his friend's recommendation, to get over the hump and appreciate it \"when it gets good\".\n\nA series of films, however, is seemingly a different matter. By substituting 10+ hours of filmed-for-television with something more cinematic, the prospect of getting over a similar 'hump' in a long-running set of sequels<!-- ...makes this sentence seems incomplete; but I don't actually know what the editor concerned originally intended to say here -->. While the total runtime of movies varies, and the total runtime of television seasons varies even more, [[Randall]] estimates that 8 films and a season of television will both run between 10 and 15 hours. \n\nThere are legitimate reasons why people might treat these situations differently:\n* A television series that gets good can be expected to run for at least five seasons, whereas nine movies is already quite long for a movie series. The ratio of 'good' to 'bad' content is likely to be much better for a television series.\n* Watching a television series is generally more convenient than watching multiple films. While streaming has lowered the barrier to watching movies, each one still requires a continuous block of time and attention (usually between 90 and 120 minutes). TV episodes historically ran from 23 to 46 minutes, and still generally run less than an hour each. This makes it easier to fit the content into a busy schedule. \n* The longer run-time of a movie generally means that a film series will focus on one specific plotline in each entry, whereas televised series are or can be more episodic (the characters are involved in a different situation each time) and can also interweave plotlines throughout individual episodes or episode arcs, so that less time per episode is spent on plots viewers dislike.\n* In the US, a film typically begins shooting from a completed script with only minor revisions conducted once filming starts; whereas in television, writers are usually engaged throughout most of a series' season and can more quickly change unpopular elements in future episodes.\n\nThe mention of “after the first 8 movies” might be a reference to the long-running Fast and the Furious franchise, which now has 9 movies (plus a couple of spin-offs) at the time of this comic’s publication. The more recent movies are well-reviewed (rated “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes), even though the first four were widely panned by critics. Someone like Randall, who may have ignored the franchise when it first came out in 2001, may be wondering if he should watch the more recent ones that critics generally like; and, if so, does he need to catch up on the initial movies first?\n\nThe title text talks of the long-running British TV series that is ''{{w|Doctor Who}}''. The original Doctor Who, running from 1963-1989 was typically low budget, for its time and locality, though initially considered cutting edge in many ways. Compared to more modern classics, and especially Hollywood sci-fi, it would be noticeably not as good. The revived series (2005-present) has a much higher production budget and is typically much more aligned to modern viewers, who may willfully ignore or not even know of the older episodes. Someone just starting to watching Doctor Who sequentially from the ''very'' first season (broadcast in 1963) would have to watch hundreds of episodes (26 'seasons', by some counts) before the series \"gets good\" to modern eyes, if the {{tvtropes|GrowingTheBeard|\"good\" point}} is the 2005 series revival, or even quite a few to reach any given key point in the original run. What's more, trying to watch the series from the beginning is literally impossible because dozens of episodes have become lost media over the decades, with the footage erased by the BBC (though the audio from every episode has miraculously survived). Thus Doctor Who is considered to be its own thing, and unlike other shows where the fans recommend you suffer through a poor first season to enjoy improvement in subsequent seasons, {{w|Whovians}} might recommend potential new fans to begin with the 2005 reboot (technically the 27th season), which was produced to appeal to all new-comers without even necessarily any cultural knowledge of what had been broadcast up until the long hiatus a decade and a half before.\n\nIt is vague about Randall's precise opinion, but even the most dedicated fan would acknowledge that it has had a varying quality/charm/consistency/etc, according to one's personal tastes for such things. Comparing the original run (pre-Millenium, featuring seven key actors sequentially taking on the title role over more than four decades, and another for a standalone TV-movie) with the revived series (continuing the pattern with a similar number of additional title-actors in just half the time), and any number of 'show-runners' (producers, main writers, etc) is one possible point of contention, probably more suited to British viewers. Possibly, in Randall's case, it is just the (perceived) ups and downs in the more recent era, which has been more consistently screened in the US.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two situations are depicted between White Hat and Cueball.]\n:[Situation 1:]\n:White Hat: You should keep watching! After the first season it gets really good.\n:Cueball: Oh yeah, I've heard that!\n:[Situation 2:]\n:White Hat: You should keep watching! After the first 8 movies, they get really good.\n:Cueball: Haha, what? I'm not going to sit through '''''eight''''' bad movies!\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:It's weird how it's way more normal and socially acceptable to suggest someone spend 10-15 hours watching something when it's TV rather than movies.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who]]"
