Here, though, [[Megan]] is a linguist, so for her the term \"foot\" refers not to the body part but to the term's meaning in {{w|Prosody (linguistics)|prosody}}. In this context, {{w|Foot (prosody)|\"foot\"}} means, per Wikipedia, \"the basic metrical unit that generates a line of verse in most Western traditions of poetry,\" and thus \"foot fetish\" means an attraction to words that follow such a format.\n\nCommon types of feet (which are all referenced in this comic) include:\n\n*''{{w|trochee}}'' – a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (demonstrated in the first set of words: \"'''sto'''-ry\", \"'''wa'''-ter\", \"'''pa'''-per\", \"'''door'''-way\") (see also [[856: Trochee Fixation]]).\n\n*''{{w|iamb (poetry)|iamb}}'' – an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (as seen in the second set: \"dis-'''arm'''\", \"A-'''dele's'''\", \"gi-'''raffe'''\", \"gre-'''nade'''\") (perhaps the best-known foot, due to {{w|iambic pentameter|its use}} by {{w|William Shakespeare}}) (see also [[79: Iambic Pentameter]]).\n\n*''{{w|dactyl (poetry)|dactyl}}'' – a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (used in the third set: \"'''straw'''-ber-ry\", \"'''scor'''-pi-on\", \"'''po'''-et-ry\").\n\n*''{{w|anapest}}'' – (referenced in the title text) two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable; it is thus the reverse of a dactyl (see the [[#Discussion|discussion section]]). Note that the word ''anapest,'' pronounced \"[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/anapest ANN-][https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anapest a-][https://languages.oup.com/ pest],\" is itself a dactyl, not an anapest, because the stress is on the first syllable. So it is an instance of a {{w|heterological word}}.\n\nMegan thus wishes that [[Cueball]] first use a trochee during foreplay, then switch to an iamb during her main stimulation phase (intercourse or some other type that still enables Cueball to speak freely), and finally switch to a dactyl as she orgasms. According to the title text, after sex she wishes for him to hold her while he whispers the word \"anapest\" in her ear. But for a linguist like Megan, this is just four different types of \"foot\" stimulation - thus she can be said to have a foot fetish.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are in a bed.]\n:Megan: Can you repeat \"Story Water Paper Doorway\" at the start, then switch to \"Disarm Adele's Giraffe Grenade\" as we get going, and finally \"Strawberry Scorpion Poetry\" as I finish?\n:[Below the frame.]\n:Linguist with a foot fetish\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
