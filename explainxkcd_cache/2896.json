Here, [[Cueball]], [[Hairbun]], and [[White Hat]] are {{w|crossword puzzle}} constructors, but some of the words they would like to use would result in awkward sequences of letters which are not English words or familiar names, such as \"aete\", \"eni\", etc. However, they have an idea to write a letter to persuade prominent singers ({{w|Taylor Swift}}, {{w|Ed Sheeran}}, {{w|Nicki Minaj}}, {{w|Ariana Grande}} and {{w|The Weeknd}}) to choose these awkward sequences of letters as titles of their future albums, thereby letting Cueball, Hairbun, and White Hat write clues about those albums and use those letter sequences as answers.   \n\nThe particular sequences of letters that are selected are notable for their exclusive usage of the {{w|Letter frequency|most common English letters}}. Most of them also begin and end with a vowel. These are two features that are common in \"{{w|crosswordese}}\", i.e., words which appear significantly more often in crosswords than in reality. Examples of crosswordese that are actually used include the words \"{{w|OREO}}\", \"{{w|Épée|EPEE}}\", and \"{{w|Yoko Ono|ONO}}\". \n\nThe title text lists another sequence of awkward letters, \"eHit\". Here, Cueball, Hairbun, and White Hat ask these singers to refer their hits (popular songs) as \"eHit\"s, adding the \"e\" for electronic such as in e-mail and e-dating. This is also a reference to common crossword entries like \"E-TAIL\" or \"E-MAG\" which are often criticized for using the prefix \"E\" to create words that no one really uses.\n\n===Possible unintended meanings of words===\n*aete: {{w|Apple_event#Object_Model|AppleEvent Terminology Extension}}\n*eni: {{w|Eni|Eni S.p.A.}}, Italian multinational energy company; the name of an {{w|Eniola Aluko|England footballer}}\n*oreta: ''{{w|Oreta}}'', moth genus in family {{w|Drepanidae}}\n*aroe: {{w|Aroe}} may refer to: The Aru Islands Regency, islands in eastern Indonesia; Aroe, an alternative name for Aroi, Patras, in western Greece\n*oine: {{w|Kusumoto Ine}}, also known as O-Ine, Japanese physician; ''öine'' means nocturnal/nightly in Estonian, and features in the titles of a number of albums by artists from that country.\n*aen: {{w|AEN}} may refer to: Acute esophageal necrosis, a rare esophageal disorder; and more\n*''{{w|Enta da Stage}}'' is the debut album by American East Coast hip hop group Black Moon.\n*aerae: ''[[wikt:aerae|aerae]]'' (Latin noun) genitive/dative singular and nominative plural of ''[[wikt:aera#Latin|aera]]'' (era)\n\n\nThe above words and definitions would be considered too obscure for use in most American crossword puzzles, as puzzle editors normally prefer answers to be at least somewhat familiar to the general public, even if the answers wind up being clued obscurely.\n\n===Uses in mainstream crossword puzzles===\nSome of these words have appeared in the New York Times crossword, albeit only in the pre-1992 era (that is, before the current editor Will Shortz began his tenure).\n*aroe: Clued as a variant spelling for the {{w|Aru Islands Regency}}, and also as part of the phrase \"and be thou like unto a roe\" from the King James Bible.\n*aen: Clued as an abbreviation for the ''{{w|Aeneid}}'' or as an abbreviation for the Latin word ''aeneus'' meaning \"of bronze\" or \"of copper\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at a table and typing on his laptop, with small movement lines above his hands indicating typing. White Hat and Hairbun are standing behind him and looking at what he writes. The text he writes can be seen above them. The list of words at the end are written in two columns with four words in each. Here below, the second column of words is written below the first:]\n:Dear Ms. Swift, Mr. Sheeran, Ms. Minaj, Ms. Grande, and Mr. Weeknd,\n:We are a group of crossword puzzle constructors, and we would like to suggest some titles for your future albums:\n\n:•Aete &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•Oine\n:•Eni &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•Aen\n:•Oreta &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•Enta\n:•Aroe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•Aerae\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Games]]"
