The previous one was [[33: Self-reference]], and the next one was [[35: Sheep]].\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic plays off the pun between [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stumped stumped], meaning confused or at a loss, and a {{w|Tree stump|tree stump}}, which is the remnants of a tree that has been cut down. Anyone snooping into his journal would be punished by such a terrible pun. In the title text, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] says the pun is so terrible he doesn't even want to talk about it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A tree holding a chainsaw over a recently cut-down tree. The first text is in a frame at the top of the panel.]\n:I found this in one of my high-school notebooks. I think I drew it just to take revenge on people snooping through my stuff.\n:Tree stump: Well, you stumped me...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 36]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
