The map also plays with the joke by noting it has been labeled by [[Randall Munroe|a specific American]] rather than \"Americans\".\n\nMany areas of the UK are most familiar to foreigners thanks to their depiction in various fantasy novels and TV series. This map labels some of these, as well as including many silly names that simply sound like real British towns to an American ear. A protractor is shown off the coast of the {{w|Mull of Kintyre}} in reference to the \"{{w|Mull of Kintyre test}}\" - according to urban legend, the angle of the Mull defines the maximum allowed erectness for a man on films and home video releases in the UK.\n\nRandall previously posted [https://blog.xkcd.com/2015/11/24/a-puzzle-for-the-uk/ a map of Great Britain] on his blog as part of the promotion for his book ''[[What If? (book)|What If?]]''. This map is from a very similar position and appears to have been traced from the same source, although there are some slight differences. Both maps include a sketch of {{w|Lake Windermere}} with boats on it, and both have the locations of London, Oxford and Cambridge labeled (the blog map also shows Edinburgh and Bristol - in this comic, these are labelled Eavestroughs and Minas Tirith). Both also contain references to {{w|Stonehenge}} and {{w|Watership Down}}.\n\nNote that in British English, the correct spelling of “labeled” is ‘labelled’.\n\nThe title text plays around with the concept of the compass directions and how numerous regions (such as South \"Sussex\" and West \"Wessex\") incorporate such literal names in their description. Randall is creating similar sounding names which are nonsense-ish (\"Norsussex\" would be the region of the Northern-Southern Saxons), and placing them in relation to each other in ways which would be geographically implausible, similar to this [http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/92q3/xx19.html old joke about Boston]. However, in Germany there exists the region called ''Westphalia'' (''Westfalen''), and the eastern part of it is often referred to as ''East-Westphalia'' (''{{w|Ostwestfalen}}''), which sounds somewhat ridiculous. Part of the joke in the title text could be the fact that while three of the locations are fictional, {{w|Middlesex}} does actually exist.\n\n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=5 class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Label on the map  !!

Fhqwhgads was previously mentioned in [[1571: Car Model Names]].\n|| {{w|Wrexham}}\n|| This is near the Welsh border; Welsh names often look like a mish-mash of consonants to English speakers ignorant of Welsh orthography; within a few miles of Wrexham are towns like {{w|Yr Wyddgrug}} (\"Mold\" in English), {{w|Cefn-y-bedd}}, {{w|Gwernymynydd}} and {{w|Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog}}.\n|-\n| Cadbury\n|| {{w|Cadbury}} is a British chocolate company.\n|| Near {{w|Boston, Lincolnshire}}\n|| Cadbury actually built a town for its workers... but it's called {{w|Bournville}}.

English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). Scottish dramas such as 'Taggart' will no longer be broadcast with subtitles.You must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England.

The area shown is borderline-uninhabitable, as it is marshland and lies mostly below sea-level. Only a few farms and isolated hamlets exist here.\n|-\n| Hamwich\n|| A ham sandwich. Both \"-ham\" and \"-wich\" are common generic placenames.  The village called simply \"Ham\" and the other called \"Sandwich\" are fairly close to each other, with a famous roadsign that points to \"Ham Sandwich\" between them.  The bread-slices-and-filling foodstuff is named for the 4th Earl of Sandwich, and hence ultimately from the town of the same name.\n|| {{w|Norwich}}\n|| Likely to be coincidence but the \"Cheese Hamwich\" is a breaded cheese and turkey food product sold by {{w|Bernard Matthews Ltd}} whose food processing facility is based not far from this map location.\n|-\n| West Norsussex\n|| Mash-up of {{w|West Sussex}} (\"South Saxons\") with the obsolete {{w|Wessex}} (\"West Saxons\") and never extant {{w|Norsex}} (\"North Saxons\").\n|| {{w|Midlands}}\n||\n|-\n| Redsox\n|| The {{w|Boston Red Sox}} are a baseball team.\n|| {{w|The Fens}}\n||  The Boston Red Sox play at Fenway Park.

However, they are usually no longer known by those names in Wales.\n|| {{w|Powys}}\n||  \n|-\n| Lionsgate\n|| {{w|Lionsgate|A film studio}}.\n|| {{w|Leicester}}\n|| The word/suffix \"-gate\" in placenames often refer to {{w|Harrogate|ancient streets or roads}}, or possibly such a way through a gap that is natural (e.g. {{w|Ramsgate}}'s cliffs) or in a city wall (which can thus be sealed, or 'gated'). There are no obvious inspirations for Lionsgate in that part of the country &emdash; ''Ram''sgate, in particular, is at the extreme eastern end of the southern edge of the UK.\n|-\n| Kingsbottom\n|| Another \"-bottom\". A possible reference to {{w|King's Landing}}, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms of {{w|Westeros}} and one of its districts Fleabottom.\n|| {{w|Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve|Suffolk Coast}}\n||  Possibly named for the town of {{w|King's Lynn}}, also located in East Anglia but close to its north coast.\n|-\n| Aberforth\n|| {{w|Aberforth Dumbledore}} is {{w|Albus Dumbledore}}'s brother in the ''Harry Potter'' series. The name is sometimes translated as \"from the river\", but without any etymological references. \"Aber\" is Welsh for a \"river mouth\" or estuary, and is widespread in Wales, and occasionally found due to Celtic influence in other parts of the UK (such as {{w|Aberdeen}}).\n|| {{w|Aberystwyth}}\n|| {{w|Aberporth}} (\"Mouth [of the] port\" - the Welsh equivalent of the English name Portsmouth) is a real town located a little further southwest along the Welsh coast. {{w|Forth}} may be a reference to the {{w|Firth of Forth}} in Scotland, where \"Firth\" means estuary or fjord, and \"Forth\" is thought to mean \"the open air\". Aberforth would literally mean \"the mouth of the river Forth\", which is the location of {{w|Edinburgh}} in Scotland. Alternatively, \"forth\" in Welsh could be a soft mutated form of the Welsh name \"{{w|Borth}}\" (the name of a town - but not a river - a little further north along the coast), which is itself a soft mutated form of the word \"porth\" meaning port.\n|-\n| South Norwessex\n|| Another mash-up of {{w|Sussex}} (\"South Saxons\") with the obsolete {{w|Wessex}} (\"West Saxons\") and never extant {{w|Norsex}} (\"North Saxons\"). Also southwest of West Norsussex.\n|| {{w|Birmingham}}\n|| \n|-\n| Dryford\n|| Would refer to a river crossing without water. \"{{w|Ford (crossing)|-ford}}\" is a common placename element.\n|| {{w|Shropshire Hills}}\n||\n|-\n| Frampton\n|| There are many {{w|Frampton}}s in the UK. It means \"town on the river Frome\" - and there are also several {{w|River Frome}}s.

Together, they form {{w|Oxbridge}}.\n|-\n| Kingsfriend\n|| Possibly a joke about the royal patronage given to certain towns - for instance, {{w|Bognor Regis}} and {{w|Royal Wootton Bassett}}. Also {{w|Knighton, Powys|Knighton}} (a King's friend?) is very close to this locale, and so is {{w|Kington, Herefordshire|Kington}}.\n|| Near the England-Wales border\n||\n|-\n| Cair Paravel\n|| {{w|Cair Paravel}} is the castle where the ruler of {{w|Narnia}} lives in the ''Narnia'' series.\n|| {{w|Dedham Vale}}\n|| \n|-\n| Camelot\n|| {{w|Camelot}} was (in legend) {{w|King Arthur}}'s court.\n|| Near the England-Wales border\n|| The King Arthur myth did in fact originate in the Welsh culture. However, most sites associated with Camelot, such as {{w|Winchester}}, {{w|Glastonbury}} and {{w|Cadbury Castle}}, are in England.\n|-\n| Nothingham\n|| A pun on {{w|Nottingham}}, famous for {{w|Sherwood Forest}}, the legendary home of {{w|Robin Hood}}.\n|| Near {{w|Northampton}}\n|| \n|-\n| Cumberbatch\n|| A surname, best known as that of actor {{w|Benedict Cumberbatch}}.\n|| {{w|Harlow}}\n|| The surname of {{w|Jean Harlow|a famous actress}} is replaced with that of a famous actor.\n|-\n| Dampshire\n|| A pun on the county of {{w|Hampshire}}.

May be a reference to other -ing towns like {{w|Reading, Berkshire|Reading}} (which is actually pronounced \"redding\", not \"reeding\"), and also to its location in Wales.\n|| {{w|Merthyr Tydfil}}\n|| \n|-\n| Paulblart\n|| ''{{w|Paul Blart: Mall Cop}}'' is a 2009 comedy film starring Kevin James.\n|| Near {{w|Chelmsford}}\n|| Possibly a humorous contrast with Cumberbatch above, a highbrow British classical actor followed by a lowbrow American movie character.\n|-\n| Oxford\n|| {{w|Oxford|No joke}}.\n|| {{w|Oxford}}\n|| See Cambridge. Surprisingly, Randall made no attempt to troll readers by switching the locations of Cambridge and Oxford. Or he did, but ironically from the wrong 'correct' assumption!\n|-\n| Moorhen\n|| The {{w|moorhen}} is a waterfowl.\n|| {{w|Gower Peninsula}}\n|| Possibly punning on nearby {{w|Swansea}}.\n|-\n| Cardigan\n|| {{w|Cardigan, Ceredigion|No joke}} - it seems funny to Americans because of the {{w|Cardigan (sweater)|knitted sweater}} popularised by the {{w|James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan|Earl of Cardigan}}.\n|| {{w|Newport, Wales}}\n|| The actual Cardigan is on the west coast. The name may be punning on the city of {{w|Cardiff}}, capital of Wales, which is further south-west.\n|-\n| BBC Channel 4\n|| A composite of {{w|Channel 4}} and the {{w|BBC}} (UK TV operators) confusing the meaning of TV channel with a geographic channel. There ''is'' a {{w|BBC Four}} (digital TV channel) ''and'' a {{w|BBC Radio 4}} (FM and digital radio) with an {{w|BBC Radio 4 Extra|adoptive daughter-station}} (digital only, originally called BBC7), but none of these are ever really called \"BBC Channel 4\" by locals, and it is hard to say what detail 'an American' might ''think'' they'd know.\n|| {{w|Bristol Channel}}\n|| \n|-\n| London\n|| By virtue of being the capital and largest city, as well as a famous {{w|world city}}, London is one of the few cities in Britain that anyone, no matter how ignorant of British geography, can manage to name correctly.\n|| London\n|| It is not unknown for foreigners ''and'' British alike (even some residents of London) to assume that London has a more central location in England (such as {{w|Midlands|'The Midlands'}}) or {{w|Britannia Inferior|even further towards the north}}. Randall seems to be more knowledgable than this.\n|-\n| GMT\n|| A reference to {{w|Greenwich Mean Time}}. Shown on the map near the London bourough of Greenwich through which the GMT meridian passes.\n|| {{w|Greenwich}} (roughly)\n|| \n|-\n| Corbyn\n|| A reference to the leader (at the time of publication) of the UK {{w|Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party}} {{w|Jeremy Corbyn}}.\n|| {{w|The Cotswolds}}\n|| May be a confusion with the town of {{w|Corby}} although it is not near the location shown.\n|-\n| Tems-upon-Thames\n|| A joke about the counter-intuitive pronunciation of {{w|Thames}}.\n|| {{w|Rochester}}\n|| \n|-\n| Minas Tirith\n|| {{w|Minas Tirith}} is the capital of Gondor in ''Lord of the Rings'' and is built on the side of a mountain.\n|| {{w|Bristol}}\n|| Clifton Village, in Bristol, is built on the side of the Avon Gorge so could be compared to {{w|Minas Tirith}}. Nearby {{w|Cheddar Gorge}} is famous for its steep cliffs that resemble the landscape from Lord of the Rings.  \n|-\n| Hogsmeade\n|| {{w|Hogsmeade}} is the nearest village to Hogwarts in the ''Harry Potter'' books.\n|| {{w|Dover}}\n|| The fictional Hogsmeade was in Scotland. Randall shows the {{w|Channel Tunnel}} running from there, a possible reference to Hogsmeade's secret connections to Hogwarts.\n|-\n| Tubemap\n|| The {{w|Tube Map}} is the map of the {{w|London Underground}}, widely considered a masterpiece of design.\n|| {{w|Outer London}}\n|| \n|-\n| Cambnewton\n|| {{w|Cam Newton}} is quarterback for the {{w|Carolina Panthers}}. \"Cam-\" is common for placenames on any of the several British rivers called \"{{w|Cam River|Cam}}\", while \"Newton\" means \"new town\".

The detail on the map is minimal, showing mainly the outlines of the land, chevrons representing otherwise sparse areas of high hills or mountains, and points representing cities.

The caption in the upper-right states in large letters \"A BRITISH MAP,\" then in smaller letters underneath, \"LABELED BY AN AMERICAN.\" Most of the map's area is covered by labels for various features, which are listed below.]\n\n <nowiki>\n[In Scotland, from north to south:]\n  Helcaraxë\n  Blick\n  Everdeen\n  Norther Sea (to the west)\n  Highlands\n  Loch Lomond\n  Fjordham\n  Glassdoor\n  Eavestroughs\n  Seasedge\n  Meowth\n  Chough\n  Blighton\n  Glutenfree\n\n[In England, from north to south:]\n  Eyemouth\n  Earhand\n  Hairskull\n  Lakebottom\n  Braintree\n  Skinflower\n  Weedle\n  Bjork\n  Crewneck\n  Paisley\n  Eeugh\n  Aidenn\n  Basil\n  Hillfolk\n  Waterdown\n  Borough-Upon-Mappe\n  Cadbury\n  Landmouth (to the East)\n  The Shire\n  West Norsussex\n  Redsox\n  Hamwich\n  Lionsgate\n  Keebler\n  South Norwessex\n  Kingsbottom\n  Cambridge\n  Frampton\n  Nothingham\n  Cair Paravel\n  Dampshire\n  Cumberbatch\n  Oxford\n  Paulblart\n  Corbyn\n  London\n  GMT\n  BBC Channel 4 (to the West)\n  Minas Tirith\n  Tems-Upon-Thames\n  Tubemap\n  Hogsmeade\n  Cambnewton\n  Oughghough\n  Efrafa\n  Chansey\n  Sundial\n  Lower Bottom\n  Dobby\n  Menthol\n  West Sea (to the West)\n  Blandford\n  Southframpton\n  Tarp\n  Longbit\n\n[In Wales, from north to south:]\n  Fhqwhgads\n  Cabinetry\n  Bloughshire\n  Aberforth\n  Dryford\n  Kingsfriend\n  Camelot\n  The CW\n  Whaling\n  Moorhen\n  Cardigan\n\n[In Northern Ireland:]\n  Belfast Devoe\n\n[In the Republic of Ireland:]\n  Dubstep\n </nowiki>\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Maps]]\n[[Category:Harry Potter]]\n[[Category:Chronicles of Narnia]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Pokémon]]"
