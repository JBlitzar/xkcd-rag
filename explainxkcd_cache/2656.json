See this [[#Table with numbers|table with numbers]] for easy overview.\n\nThis reveals some very commonly used full terms like \"{{w|Theoretical Physics}}\", the most discovered, which represents almost four million hits compared to the next highest, \"{{w|Computational Biology}}\", with almost 3 million hits and {{w|Astrophysics}} with 2 million hits. Ducking just below 1 million hits is fourth placing {{w|Marine Biology}}. Of the 42 possible fields just 14 have more than 100,000 hits, and only four more have over 10,000.\n\nBut there are also some that have much lower numbers, eight with fewer than 10 hits in the table. \"High-Energy Psychology\" and \"Marine Dentistry\" have just one apparent occurrence each (equivalent to a {{w|Googlewhack}}), whilst there are no hits at all recorded for four of the initially combined terms. In total (with the title text) there are 48 fields, see a full [[#List of Scientific fields|list of scientific fields]] below.\n\nAn explanation for both existing and fictive scientific fields can be given below in the [[#Table with explanations|table with explanations]].\n\nIn the caption to the table Randall list four potential research opportunities i.e. those with no hits in the table: Quantum Dentistry, High-Energy Dentistry, Astrodentistry and High-Energy Theology\n\nHe thus suggests that, because of the (apparent) lack of current studies in these specialized sub-fields, there may be unexplored potential for a study. This could be that the more \"used\" areas have far too much competition and be might  already be \"used up\" for potentially useful discoveries. (This does not account for how much 'study space' might be available in a given box of research, even though Randall has previously hinted that anything \"Astro\"-related is potentially [[2640: The Universe by Scientific Field|full of many things to study]].)\nOf course the real reason for no one studying these fields are that they make no sense. {{w|Dentistry}} is related to fixing peoples teeth. The quantum world has no effect on human teeth,{{Citation needed}} and high-energy bombardment of a human's mouth may also be a bit dangerous (although x-rays and radiation treatment in the mouth could be seen as high energy). Astrodentistry is not really relevant if seeing this as something used on humans. Of course astronauts might need dentistry while in space, but it would be a stretch to call the study of dentistry in zero-G, \"astrodentistry\". \"High-energy Theology\" as a term, seems more likely to have been used...\n\nIn the title text Randall lists the figures for another 'major' field suffix, \"{{w|Massage}}\", and the numbers of its prefixed forms. From this, we learn that Astromassage is another 'open' field that is currently unstudied, but none of the five others have more than 10. Probably the most surprising aspect of the title text is that there are hits for both quantum massage and high-energy massage.{{citation needed}}\n\n===Table with numbers===\n*Here the table is presented with only numbers, so it can be sorted.\n**Massage from the title text has been added.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!\n!

Field\n! Number of Searches\n! Explanation of field\n|-\n| Theoretical Physics\n| 3990000\n| {{w|Theoretical Physics}} is a whole field in itself, with journals made only for that type of physics. Also the one with by far most hits.\n|- \n| Theoretical Chemistry\n| 445000\n| {{w|Theoretical chemistry}} is the branch of chemistry which explores the underlying explanations for chemical phenomena, and has major overlaps with Quantum Chemistry.\n|-\n| Theoretical Biology\n| 553000\n| {{w|Theoretical biology}} aims at the mathematical representation and modeling of biological processes, using techniques and tools of applied mathematics. It has applications in the modelling of biological systems and evolutionary systems.\n|-\n| Theoretical Engineering\n| 2460\n| 'Theoretical engineering' is a term that can be applied to many different types of engineering. A few that can be found on the front page, as of the time of writing, are software engineering, mobile engineering, band engineering and engineering optimisation. The term itself simply talks about the theory to do with those types of engineering.\n|-\n| Theoretical Psychology\n| 15500\n| Searching this term yields almost five million results, at the time of writing. According to the [https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ps.04.020153.002251 first result], this branch is the {{w|epistemological}} analysis of psychological science.\n|-\n| Theoretical Theology\n| 726\n| Theoretical Theology is a bit of a misnomer, considering that Theology is theoretical from the outset. Theoretical Theology would hence be equivalent to Theology, that is, the systematic study of divine nature and religion in general. Unless, perhaps, it concerns itself with questions of how any given theology would have to be under differing conditions, e.g. how a society would interact under the aegis of different moralities or deitic purposes than those currently understood to exist by that society.\n|-\n| Theoretical Dentistry\n| 41\n| While there is theory in dentistry, as with all other sciences, there is no branch of dentistry specifically concerning it.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n| Theoretical Massage\n| 10\n| Theoretical Massage is not a real scientific field,{{Citation needed}} but rather the theory about it, in contrast to the practical application of {{w|Massage|massage}}. This term is most likely to be used in the context of learning or studying massages, for example during the process of becoming a massage therapist. Alternatively this term could refer to the studying of the masses of matter, (or its massage if you will). This would make it a field of physics.\n|-\n| Quantum Physics\n| 478000\n| As with Theoretical Physics, above, {{w|Quantum Physics}} is an entire field within itself.\n|-\n| Quantum Chemistry\n| 740000\n| A field within chemistry, quantum chemistry is the study of how quantum-level effects extrapolate to chemical properties, such as the shape of electron orbitals.\n|-\n| Quantum Biology\n| 7620\n| {{w|Quantum Biology}} is a legitimate field, strange as though it may seem. It also applies another \"strange\" field elsewhere in this table: theoretical chemistry.\n|-\n| Quantum Engineering\n| 21100\n| Quantum engineering is the engineering of technology that uses the laws of quantum mechanics for their operation. It is used in the manufacture of quantum sensors and quantum computers. An emerging field, it is slowly growing alongside the current rise in quantum applications in technology and the push towards quantum computing.\n|-\n| Quantum Psychology\n| 699\n| Quantum Psychology is used in a similar manner to Quantum Theology (see below) - a way push pseudoscience under the guise of quantum phenomena. While quantum effects can be seen in the brain, it would mostly fall under the purview of neuroscience.\n|-\n| Quantum Theology\n| 447\n| Using 'Quantum' as a buzzword to prop up forms of spirituality is a common form of pseudoscience today, and is used to push fringe beliefs under the illusion of 'quantum phenomena'.\n|-\n| Quantum Dentistry\n| None\n| This would presumably be dentistry done on teeth which are too small to be observed on normal levels, or do not exist while also existing. \n|-\n| Quantum Massage\n| 6\n| Similar to Quantum Theology, the word 'quantum' is being used as a buzzword to promote massage services which no actual relation to quantum phenomena.\n|-\n| High-Energy Physics\n| 844000\n| High-Energy physics is the study of fundamental particles and forces that constitute matter and radiation. Also known as particle physics, it is a major subfield of theoretical and quantum physics.\n|-\n| High-Energy Chemistry\n| 9600\n| High-Energy Chemistry refers to the chemistry of high-energy compounds.  \n|-\n| High-Energy Biology\n| 3\n| High-Energy Biology would probably refer to biology at high energies. However, at that point, biology stops being biology and starts being physics.\n|-\n| High-Energy Engineering\n| 119\n| High-Energy Engineering would most likely refer to engineering undertaken for high-energy environments. However, this is not a real subfield of engineering and would more likely be done by as a part of another subfield of engineering.\n|-\n| High-Energy Psychology\n| 1\n| High-Energy Psychology would presumably refer to psychology done at high energies. However, the result which this refers to is, in fact, an advertisement for a job which requires knowledge of psychology and the ability to sustain your energy for a large period of time.  \n|-\n| High-Energy Theology\n| None\n| High-Energy Theology presumably involves theology performed at extremely high energies. It is unknown if one can find God in a particle accelerator however.{{Citation needed}} \n|-\n| High-Energy Dentistry\n| None\n| High-Energy Dentistry would most likely involve performing dentistry with high-energy particle beams, which would be incredibly damaging to a human being. High energy lasers do exist and are used in dentistry, however they are orders of magnitude less energetic than the high-energy beams this prefix would refer to. \n|-\n| High-Energy Massage\n| 2\n| High-Energy Massage could either mean a massage done with lots of energy, which may or may not be a soothing experience, or a massage that leaves you with lots of energy, which is a claimed benefit by many massage therapists. \n|-\n| Computational Physics\n| 510000\n|  The field of using computational models to simulate physical systems. Such models are commonly used in both theoretical and applied physics, hence the large number of hits.\n|-\n| Computational Chemistry\n| 599000\n|  The field of using computational models to simulate chemical systems. Commonly used in the field of theoretical chemistry.\n|-\n| Computational Biology\n| 2910000\n|  Computational biology refers to the use of data analysis, mathematical modeling and computational simulations to understand biological systems and relationships. Due to its very high relevance in the fields of genetics, biochemistry, evolution, neuroscience among others, has the highest number of hits for the 'Computational' prefix, and is 2nd highest overall.\n|-\n| Computational Engineering\n| 67400\n|  Computational Engineering is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models for engineering. Being a subfield of engineering, it has a moderate amount of hits.\n|-\n| Computational Psychology\n| 4620\n| Computational Psychology, also known as {{w|Computational cognition}} is the study of learning and cognition via mathematical modelling and computer simulation.\n|-\n| Computational Theology\n| 40\n| Computational Theology is a very fringe field, that seeks to explore the relations between God, religion and computer science and related phenomena.\n|-\n| Computational Dentistry\n| 11\n|Computational Dentistry refers to using artificial intelligence to improve dentistry. This could presumably be used to allow a robot to do troublesome tasks, such as root canals.  \n|-\n| Computational Massage\n| 1\n| It is unknown what computation would be required for massage, if any. Searches show results for a paper on 'Computational Modeling of Deep Tissue Heating by an Automatic Thermal Massage Bed: Predicting the Effects on Circulation'.\n|-\n| Marine Physics\n| 3920\n| Marine Physics is a subfield of oceanography that focuses on the fundamental physical processes in the marine environment and their effects on the biosphere.\n|-\n| Marine Chemistry\n| 136000\n| Marine chemistry studies the chemistry of marine environments including the influences of different variables, such as plate tectonics, currents, sediments, pH levels, atmospheric constituents, metamorphic activity and ecology.\n|-\n| Marine Biology\n| 945000\n| Marine biology is the study of marine organisms, their behaviors and interactions with the environment. A very well established subfield of Biology, hence the high number of hits.\n|-\n| Marine Engineering\n| 108000\n| Marine engineering is the operation, maintenance and monitoring of mechanical systems aboard marine vessels, including boats, ships and submarines. Moderately known, due to the continued growth of the modern shipping industry.   \n|-\n| Marine Psychology\n| 35\n| Marine Psychology is a subfield of Psychology that studies psychosocial issues and behavioral and safety concerns inherent in life and careers at sea. It does not refer to the psychology of marine life as one would assume, however.\n|-\n| Marine Theology\n| 6\n| Marine Theology is not an organized field of study, and is merely a convenient way to refer to Theology in Marine Biology. It may also result from discussion of aspects of theology as they apply to a marine society (one heavily dependent on the sea, or subject to its effects, like an island-chain population).\n|-\n| Marine Dentistry\n| 1\n| Marine Dentistry is dentistry performed on marine animals, which falls under the field of veterinary science.\n|-\n| Marine Massage\n| 1\n| Marine Massage would probably be about underwater massages. Its unknown what benefits this might give over a traditional massage however.\n|-\n| Astrophysics\n| 2010000\n| Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. Just like Theoretical Physics, it is a field onto itself, and has the 3rd highest hits for a scientific field in the comic.\n|-\n| Astrochemistry\n| 20600\n| Astrochemistry is the study of molecules in the universe, and their interaction with radiation. A hybrid field of astronomy and chemistry with overlap with Astrophysics, especially when dealing with nuclear reactions.\n|-\n| Astrobiology\n| 226000\n| Astrobiology is a scientific field that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Fairly known due to the unanswered nature of the question 'Is there life beyond Earth.' \n|-\n| Astroengineering\n| 430\n| Astronomical engineering is engineering at the astronomical scale. Highly speculative, as humanity barely has progressed beyond the Earth, and mostly the realm of science fiction. \n|-\n| Astropsychology\n| 64\n| {{w|Psychological astrology}}, also known as Astropsychology, is a form of pseudoscience blending together astrology with fields of psychology. \n|-\n| Astrotheology\n| 580\n|{{w|Astrotheology}} is the worship of heavenly bodies as deities or by association to deities. It has its roots in ancient polytheistic religions, and has survived in various forms to present-day.\n|-\n| Astrodentistry\n| None\n| Astrodentistry presumably relates to performing dentistry on astronomical objects. As astronomical bodies do not have teeth,{{Citation needed}} this is impossible to perform, and hence impossible to research.\n|-\n| Astromassage\n| None\n| Astromassage can either mean performing massages on astronomical objects, which would be impossible, or performing massages on beings in space. Since there have been no trained massage therapists in space, it is unknown how one can massage a body in space, or how the human body reacts to massages in space. \n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A table is drawn with seven columns and six rows.
