When describing the composition of stars in astronomical terms, {{w|Metallicity|metals}} are all the elements heavier than {{w|helium}}. This definition of metal is significantly broader than {{w|metal|the one used outside astronomy}}. Likewise, this chart of musical genres describes everything \"heavier\" than {{w|Pop music|pop}} as metal. The standard conception of elemental metals is a subset of the astronomical conception of metals; likewise, here the musical genre {{w|Heavy metal music|metal}} is presented as a subset of the genres cosmologists consider metal.\n\nRandall may have decided to portray pop music in a similar way to the elements helium and hydrogen as a reference to the \"{{w|Splint_(laboratory_equipment)#Burning_splint_test|pop test}}\", the test for hydrogen as a product of a chemical reaction. Possibly simultaneously, he may be thinking of how one might \"pop\" a helium balloon, thus the \"pop\" analogy pulls double duty as a reference for both elements. \n\nCosmologists also study the history and future of the universe, and the title text refers to the {{w|Big Bang}}. At roughly 10<sup>-32</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, the {{w|inflationary epoch}} ended, causing a large number of {{w|Quark|quarks, anti-quarks}}, and {{w|Gluon|gluons}} to come into existence. In {{w|inflationary cosmology}}, this point is considered to be the end of the Big Bang. Randall jokingly refers to it as \"post-\" because nearly the entire history of the universe is after this instant. This is a reference to types of music with \"post-\" in their names, e.g. {{w|post-rock}}, {{w|post-punk}}, {{w|post-metal}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n\n{| \n|+ '''Music genres according to...'''\n|- \n| <u>...Non-cosmologists</u>\n| <u>...Cosmologists</u>\n|- \n| Pop \n| Lite\n|- \n| Rock \n| Metal\n|- \n| Hip hop \n| Metal\n|- \n| Metal \n| Metal\n|- \n| Country \n| Metal\n|- \n| Dance/Electronic \n| Metal\n|- \n| Latin \n| Metal\n|- \n| Punk \n| Metal\n|- \n| Classical \n| Metal\n|- \n| Jazz \n| Metal\n|- \n| Folk \n| Metal\n|}\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
