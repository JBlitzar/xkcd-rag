This practice became outdated, in favor of using a single share button, without a share counter. From left to right the share buttons are: {{w|Facebook}}, {{w|Twitter}}, {{w|Reddit}}, and the now-defunct {{w|Google plus|Google+}}.\n\n*Twitter users were often stereotyped as trying to be comedians; hence, the article on stand-up comedy was shared most on Twitter.\n\n*{{w|Conspiracy theory}} articles garnered attention on Reddit, especially if they were against the {{w|Christian Right}} and supported {{w|Wikipedia}}, as at the time, the atheist community on Reddit was very prominent.\n\n*\"Boycott Facebook\" articles were ironically popular on Facebook. Google+, being semantically akin to Facebook, also had a significant anti-Facebook community. One of the punchlines is that Google+ wasn't being used often, before being closed down in 2019.\n\n*The last article got almost no shares at all — not many would want to admit they are reading an article about a {{w|RealDoll}}, a type of sex doll. (Also mentioned in [[Game AIs]] and [[Flying Cars]].) A custom ROM is an aftermarket distribution of the {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}} operating system and are often targeted toward enthusiasts. This community existed primarily on Google+ (as Google is the main developer of Android), and was one of the few active communities on that social network. As Android is an operating system primarily aimed at {{w|smartphones}} and {{w|tablet computers}}, installing it on a RealDoll, whilst possible due to Android's {{w|open source}} nature, would be a very niche activity, and the low number of shares indicates that it only interested a small portion of the already-small (relative to other social networks) Google+ community.\n\nThe title text humorously combines appealing subjects for all four networks:\n\n*''a hilarious joke'' – Twitter, same as above.\n*''about {{w|Mark Zuckerberg}}'' – founder of Facebook.\n*''using a {{w|pseudonym}}'' – referencing a [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9218649/Google_works_to_soothe_users_over_real_name_controversyremember controversy] about real names on Google+.\n*''to sneak past the {{w|Transportation Security Administration|TSA}}'' – Reddit, a conspiracy theory as above.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A series of article titles with four share buttons underneath each: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+]\n\n:Breaking Into Stand-up Comedy\n:FB: 3, Twitter: 1,781, Reddit: 2, G+: 0\n\n:How the Christian Right Threatens Wikipedia\n:FB: 1, Twitter: 0, Reddit: 2,241, G+: 3\n\n:Boycott Facebook Today!\n:FB: 248k, Twitter: 0, Reddit: 0, G+: 74\n\n:DIY: Installing a Custom ROM on a Realdoll\n:FB: 0, Twitter: 0, Reddit: 0, G+: 2\n\n:[Caption Below the comic]\n:Sometimes the most interesting part of an article is the share button vote breakdown\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Google Plus]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
