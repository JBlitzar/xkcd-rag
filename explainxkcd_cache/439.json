He thinks she looks cute - probably because she looks a lot like his girlfriend [[Megan]]. She is picking out produce, and quotes a line of dialogue from ''{{w|Firefly (TV series)|Firefly}}'' originally said by {{w|River Tam}} ([[Summer Glau]]): \"My food is problematic.\" Cueball ([[Randall Munroe|Randall]]) who is a big fan of ''Firefly'', notices this, and wants to flirt with her. But then Cueball's internal monologue kicks in and he starts panicking, wondering how he'd deal with starting a relationship with this woman when he's moving in the fall, as well as how things are going to work out with Megan, should things work out with this girl. He panics, needs a way out, and defenestrates himself. In real life, jumping out the window would be a very bad idea. See [https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/AccidentSearch.search?acc_keyword=%22Broken%20Glass%22&keyword_list=on/ this] for more details.\n\nThe title text refers to yet another ''Firefly'' line from the episode \"{{w|The Train Job}},\" this one said by {{w|List of Firefly characters#Hoban_Washburne|Hoban \"Wash\" Washburne}} ({{w|Alan Tudyk}}): \"Did he just go crazy and fall asleep?\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[My Problem: Thinking Ahead.]\n:Cueball: She's cute.\n:Woman: This food is problematic.\n:Cueball: Oh man, she's quoting Firefly.\n:Cueball: It's the perfect opening. But wait. I'm moving in the fall. If we hit it off, how will I deal with that?\n:Cueball: I don't want to ask her to derail her plans. And with things unresolved with Megan, can I really commit enough to make that kind of decision?\n:Cueball: Oh God.\n:Cueball: Gotta get out.\n:Cueball: The window.\n:[Cueball jumping through a window]\n:'''<big>CRASH</big>'''\n\n==Trivia==\nRandall mentioned the name Megan in his original transcript for this comic.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Firefly]]"
