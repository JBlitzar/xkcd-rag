[[Randall]] notes in the caption that no one liked his FPS mod (short for \"modification\" of the FPS game), and in the title text it is clear that [[Cueball]] who played this modified version no longer enjoys the game.\n\nFPS games are controversial for their (supposed) quality of encouraging violence such as killing (especially other human beings). One point of the controversy is that, while virtual enemies are just pixels on a screen, real enemies have actual lives, emotions, and the like. In the games, there is a disconnect between the act of killing and its emotional cost, thus leading to the controversy that FPS games encourage wanton killing (or violence in general) to solve problems instead of considering the other party. Randall makes reference to this by adding a mod that gives biographical snippets of the enemy you shoot in the game, thus giving Cueball the perspective of the enemy he just shot, and causing emotional consequence and remorse by removing the disconnection between pixel and life.\n\nThe comic can also be a reference towards making games more realistic. Giving the enemies a life above being mere targets definitely makes the game more realistic, but such a game may not be that enjoyable. This has been explored previously in [[772: Frogger]].\n\nHaving lots of unread e-mails was mentioned in [[2389: Unread]]. The third comment (\"take care of the plants back at base\") may be referring that many FPS video games have some sort of base that you must defend or start the game in. These games do not usually feature any way to take care of plants.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text talks about how gender is portrayed in games. For some people it is more emotionally affecting to kill a woman, as women are considered biologically \"weaker\" than men by many societies, and societal norms state that men must protect them. Gender equality is a highly debated topic with many different viewpoints, where one's conscious reasoned views may sometimes stand at odds to subconscious feelings. When a player becomes aware that killing women bothers one more than killing men, it exposes an inconsistency in the player's own logic, one that's very uncomfortable to confront.\n\nIn the 1993 post-apocalyptic novel'' {{w|The Fifth Sacred Thing}}'', the eco-pacifist residents of San Francisco defeat an invading army using a similar tactic. Rather than engage in armed defense, the family and friends of each dead San Franciscan speak directly to the soldiers who killed them, saying, \"My wife was the mother of five children, and I loved her dearly,\" or \"My cousin liked baseball.\" Eventually the soldiers suffer psychological breakdowns and defect ''en masse'', rather as Cueball seems to do in the title text.\n\nAmusingly, the 2014 game ''{{w|Watch Dogs}}'' does something quite similar to this; the in-game \"Profiler\" provides a brief summary of a targeted enemy, and if the enemy does not have a gameplay-relevant feature (i.e. \"Can call for backup\"), it will mention their hobbies or interests. \n\nLike most other games in the ''{{w|Sniper Elite}}'' series, the 2017 Third Person Shooter ''{{w|Sniper Elite 4}}'' allows the player to track and see brief overviews of any visible enemy by \"Tagging\" them with binoculars. However, ''Sniper Elite 4'' has the distinction of also being very similar to Randall's mod in that it displays [//sniperelite.fandom.com/wiki/Sniper_Elite_4_Allied_Intelligence short character bios] in the \"Allied Intelligence\" section of the overviews when Tagging in the campaign mode. They range from the mundane (year of conscription, former occupation) to the dark (Sapper Oswald Sander's brutal murder of a cowering fifteen year old makes even his fellow soldiers suspect him) to the comedic (Ewald Amsel regularly steals chocolate from his best friend Wolfram Wasser; Wolfram Wasser wonders who's stealing his supply of chocolates and has sworn to kill them). \n\nThe 2012 Third Person Shooter ''{{w|Spec Ops: The Line}}'' also has a section where one of the antagonists will chide you with radio message when you kill one of the enemy soldiers, often with short sympathetic descriptions of the enemy you just killed (although he'll sometimes admit he didn't actually know or like that particular person). As this game is a deconstruction of the military-style shooting games of its time and their portrayal of violence, evoking a negative emotional response in the player when killing these enemies is very much intentional.\n\nThe game ''{{w|Borderlands 2}}'' directly references this comic with the Morningstar, a unique aftermarket talking Hyperion sniper rifle which berates the user in a nagging, whiny voice any time they reload, kill an enemy, swap weapons, or score a critical hit. The weapon is obtained from the mission Hyperion Contract 873 (a reference to this comic being comic number 873) and is referred to as \"the Hyperion ex-K seedy experimental weapon\" upon completion of the mission.\nAnother game, [https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/636480/Ravenfield/&ved=2ahUKEwi4m974qP-HAxWtL0QIHWI6Fl0QFnoECDsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3BmQcRHP4sV2V0gCWu8xtC Ravenfield,] [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3307196073&searchtext= has a mod] that makes it so that every time you kill an enemy, it gives you a small fact about the person. The Steam workshop page directly references the comic, and the author says xkcd was the inspiration for the mod.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting in a chair in front of his TV holding a gamepad while playing a video game. Every time he shoots the sound is written inside a ring of small curved lines to indicate the noise.
