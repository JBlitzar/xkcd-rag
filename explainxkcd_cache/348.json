Musical notes appear around Cueball's words.]\n:Cueball: Why do birds suddenly appear\n\n:[Still singing.]\n:Cueball: Every tiiiime you are neeear\n\n:[Cueball stops singing. He looks up.]\n:Cueball: Wait, are those turkey vultures?\n\n:[Cueball turns to the zombie.]\n:Cueball: Okay, listen, are you a zombie?\n:Zombie Girl: Hurrghhh...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
