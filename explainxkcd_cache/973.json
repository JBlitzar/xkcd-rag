The programming largely (though not exclusively) consisted of {{w|music video}}s. The focus of the channel has since shifted to {{w|reality shows}}. In the channel's heyday in the 1980's and early 1990's, it was popular with teenagers and young adults. As is often the case with youth culture, it was roundly condemned by some adults as being destructive and pointless. One of the specific criticisms was that the format of short videos, with quick-edit, highly kinetic visual styles and no underlying narrative was destroying the attention span of the youth.\n\nDespite MTV no longer being especially popular (and no longer focusing on music videos), people still use the term '''MTV Generation''' to refer to the young cohort, and insist that they have poor attention spans, resulting from their media exposure. [[Megan]] explains that the term really originated about 25 years ago, to describe {{w|Generation X}}, the generation born from 1965 to 1980. The actual MTV generation has long since grown up, and most young people today either don't watch MTV, or have no idea that it was originally a music channel. Teenagers today are the children of \"the MTV generation\" (and even their grandchildren, in some cases).\n\n{{w|The Breakfast Club}} is an iconic movie from 1985 in which 5 teenagers spend a Saturday detention together at school. Principal Vernon was the overseer of the detention, and a symbol of authority and oppression of youth - the actor playing principal Vernon was around 45 years old at the time of filming. The irony is that many adults who grew up watching the movie still identify with the teenagers, but now have little in common with them.\n\nThere are a couple of themes in this strip that [[Randall]] has covered before. One is mocking adults for the assumptions they make about young people, youth culture and new technology. Adults tend to whitewash the past and insist that modern young people are being corrupted by new trends.  And when that generation of youth grows up, they tend to make the same assumptions about the next generation. [[1601: Isolation]], [[1227: The Pace of Modern Life]], [[1414: Writing Skills]], [[1348: Before the Internet]]. Another theme is making people feel old by pointing out how long ago their common memories are, as in [[647: Scary]], [[891: Movie Ages]], [[1393: Timeghost]], [[1477: Star Wars]], and [[2165: Millennials]].\n\n==Transcript==\n<!-- Note the official transcript includes more ranting. !-->\n:[Teenager playing with phone walks in background.
