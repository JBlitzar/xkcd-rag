One such feature, demonstrated in this comic, is that many clients will now warn you if you've mentioned an {{w|Email attachment|attachment}} in your email but haven't actually attached anything, a common error people make when emailing.\n\nThis has gotten to the point where email clients are increasingly stepping in to help with social obligations too; for example, reminding you if [https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/05/gmail-remind-respond.html you've left an email unanswered] for too long, or that someone is celebrating a birthday today and should be congratulated. With the increasing availability of social data and advances in machine learning, these features have the potential to become very sophisticated, to the point that they can effortlessly make social inferences and connections that might have slipped a human user's mind.\n\nSuch features are meant to be helpful aids, but have led people to be worried about privacy issues, or about how \"smart\" technology is becoming. However, in this comic, Cueball (likely representing Randall himself) has come to the uncomfortable realization that technology is now easily surpassing his own ability to maintain social relationships with other people, by being more aware of his friends' social lives than he is. He is disturbed by how unwittingly unconscientious he has become.\n\nThe title text suggests that the problem of keeping up a baseline level of interest in other people's lives eventually solves itself; implying, somewhat darkly, that if you don't put in even the bare minimum effort to keep up, you'll end up with fewer friends as some get annoyed by your lack of interest in their lives.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball at his desk using a laptop.]\n:Laptop: You got this email six days ago. Do you want to follow up?\n:Cueball: Oh, right, I should do that.\n:[Cueball types on laptop.] *type type*\n:Laptop: Did you forget the attachment?\n:Cueball: Oops, yes.\n:Laptop: Today is the recipient's birthday. Did you want to mention that?\n:Cueball: Wait, it is?\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:These reminders make me uncomfortable, not because computers are getting too smart, but because it reminds me how often I fall short of even baseline levels of conscientiousness.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Email]]"
