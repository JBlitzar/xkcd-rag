Do you realize it's the second-biggest browser-based social-networking-centered farming game in the WORLD?' Then you wait for the listener to do a double-take.}}\n\n{{TOC}}A [https://xkcd.com/802_large/ larger version] of this picture can be found by clicking the comic on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com].\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic shows a map of internet communities where the size of each region roughly corresponds to its size, and its proximity to other regions indicates similarities. This is the successor of [[256: Online Communities]]. It differs in that it is updated, and furthermore, instead of using the ''membership'' of whichever service to determine its size on the map, it uses its \"daily social activity\".\n\nThe map actually has two super−maps intended to show the relative usage of types of communication: the online community map is surrounded by the much larger \"countries\" of E−Mail, SMS (\"Instant Messaging\") and \"Cell Phones,\" which in turn are surrounded by the even huger \"Spoken Language.\"  It is unclear whether \"Cell Phones\" is intended to represent an independent region, or whether it is meant to be a sub-region of \"Spoken Language.\"  The ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that cell phones are the primary medium of SMS, and are also used to access email and online communities.  It's also unclear why other forms of communication, such as handwritten letters, are not included.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] explains that, using his definition of \"most activity per day\", Farmville is actually the ''second'' most popular social-network farming game. The Chinese game \"Happy Farm\" was more popular at the time. This strikes many English-speaking xkcd readers as odd, because Farmville is much more famous, leading one to wonder how it could not be the most played. The phrase \"browser-based social-networking–centered farming game\" is an example of an {{tvtropes|OverlyNarrowSuperlative|overly narrow superlative}}.\n\n----\n\n===Facebook Region===\nThe Facebook region deals with social networks, that is, websites oriented towards having people meet.\n\n'''{{w|Facebook}}\n\n: A social networking site that allows people to meet old real−life friends and make new friends that share similar interests. One of its most notable features is that a member can update a \"status\" or make normal posts about the happenings of the member's life, complete with pictures, other members \"liking\" these posts. The size of the Facebook region is not exaggerated, as most websites seem to allow \"liking\" their content or allow/require logging in the website with a Facebook account. There even are cell phones with a \"Facebook\" button!\n\n; {{w|FarmVille}} and {{w|Farm Town}}\n\n: These are Facebook games in which users manage farms. '''{{w|Happy Farm}},''' the Chinese game that inspired the other two, does not require Facebook integration, so it is separated by a solid line from Facebook. The \"Unethical Bay\" refers to how these games tend to addict players into constantly buying virtual items of questionable value.\n\n; People You Can't Unfriend\n\n: Refers to people whom, due to real-life expectations and relationships, unfriending them is difficult, no matter how you really feel about them.\n\n; Blatherskite River\n\n: Refers to the conversations on Facebook, which may be long yet devoid of general meaning or logic.\n\n; Data Mines\n\n: Refers to the data mining that Facebook does with the interests of its members. This fuels the profitable advertising business at the expense of customer trust.\n\n; Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions\n\n: Refers to how interactions with family members on Facebook suddenly become more awkward because everyone on Facebook (and sometimes ''off'' Facebook, given that you do not necessarily need to log in if you want to see someone's Facebook account) if you are discussing with your family through post comments.\n\n; 524,287 Strong for Mersenne Primes\n\n: Refers to the communities who gain followers for a cause. A {{w|Mersenne prime}} is a prime number that is 1 less than a power of 2\n\n; 524287\n\n: The 7th known Mersenne prime.\n\n; Jungle-Bay Mountains of \"It's Complicated\"\n\n: Refers to one of Facebook's options as to what a user's relationship status currently is. A Jungle-Bay Mountain is a complicated and undefined climate, hence the complication.\n\n; \"lamebook bay\"\n\n: Refers to the online website \"lamebook\", where users post photos of funny things that happen on Facebook (these can include statuses, \"fails\", put-downs and images.)\n\n; \"Old Facebook\" Resistance\n\n: Refers to Facebook's earlier users, who have often resisted (and resented) changes made to Facebook as it became more popular.  \n\n; Privacy Controls\n\n: This is located on the map surrounded by a Lava Pool, which is a reference to how difficult it is to find the privacy controls within Facebook.\n\n; Niche Market Mountains\n\n: Refers to social networks aimed towards more niche markets are located. Similar to how mountains tend to be isolated from mainland, niche social networks tend to be just that: niche, without much interaction with the general populace.\n\n; Charred Wasteland of Abandoned Social Networks\n\n: Refers to the tons of websites wanting to take advantage of the success of websites like Facebook to compete or even overpower with them. Even so, these websites tend to not have the userbase or even the expertise towards the long-term, hence they become wastelands: environments devoid of life, except the few life forms that are from these wastelands (in this case, the ones who are loyal to the website or which are sadly few). \n\nIn the Charred Wasteland stands:\n\n; {{w|Ozymandias}}\n\n: The titular broken statue of Shelley's poem. In the poem, only \"two vast and trunkless legs of stone\" and a \"shattered visage\" are all that remain of the once-great statue and both of these features are present in the comic. According to the poem, the pedestal before the broken statue reads \"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings...\" hence \"friend of friends\" below Ozymandias on the map.\n\nIn the north are:\n\n; The Duckface Mountains and The Red Cup Mountains\n\n: \"Duckface\" refers to [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/duck-face this incredibly obnoxious facial expression], and \"red cup pictures\" are any pictures containing party-goers holding disposable red plastic beverage cups. Facebook is absolutely flooded with both types of pictures.\n\nIn the south is:\n\n; Buzzword Bay\n\n: {{w|Buzzword}}s are words and phrases that make you sound a lot more topical than you actually are, used to garner attention. Again, Facebook status updates are commonly filled with buzzwords.\n\nWhile Facebook is the largest \"country\" of the Facebook Region, there are a lot of smaller \"countries\" that represent smaller social networks.\n\nBelow Facebook (and \"Old Facebook' Resistance\") are:\n\n; {{w|Diaspora (social network)|Diaspora}}\n\n: A fully open-source, decentralized, privacy-respecting-and-expecting alternative to Facebook. From what this map tells, Diaspora is little-known, even if Facebook is taken out of the context.\n\n; {{w|StudiVZ}}\n\n: A German-speaking social network similar if not a ripped-off version of Facebook.\n\n; {{w|XING}}\n\n: A German-speaking social platform similar to {{w|LinkedIn}}.\n\n; {{w|Ning (website)|Ning}}\n\n: A service to create custom social websites.

The website is probably best known by its memetic advertisement that said [https://dudemanphat.blogspot.com/2005/10/how-am-i-supposed-to-care-about-nick.html \"She married him??!! And they've got 7 kids??\"] (Incidentally, [https://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2003325519_adcouple27.html there is more to the coupled picture than what the advertisement says.])\n\n; {{w|MySpace}}\n\n: A social networking website that is a kind of proto-Facebook: users could customize their one-page websites with whatever they wanted, make their interests and daily lives public, and interact with other users. Back in the mid 2000s, MySpace was the largest social network. However, the surprisingly-less-customizable Facebook ended up taking the place of MySpace. The \"bands\" country of MySpace refers to how a lot of bands in the day advertised and interacted using the website. Indeed, the latest incarnation of MySpace (in terms of 2013) is more oriented towards band members.\n\n; {{w|LinkedIn}}\n\n: A social network aimed towards people in the workplace, which is why it is adjacent to Corporate Bay.\n\n; {{w|Orkut}}\n\n: This was one of Google's first social networks before Google made [https://plus.google.com/ Google+].

It is still popular in Asia.\n\n; {{w|VK (social networking website)|Vkontakte}}\n\n: VK is the second largest social network service in Europe after Facebook. It is available in several languages, but particularly popular among Russian-speaking users around the world.\n\n; {{w|Netlog}}\n\n: A Belgian social networking website specifically targeted at the global youth demographic.\n\n; {{w|Mixi}}\n\n: This is an online Japanese social networking service.\n\n; {{w|Qzone}}\n\n: A social networking website, which is big in China. According to a report published by Tencent, possibly surpassing other social networking websites like Facebook and MySpace in China.\n\n; {{w|Tuenti}}\n\n: A Spain-based, social networking service, that has been referred to as the \"Spanish Facebook.\"\n\n; {{w|Cloob}}\n\n: A Persian-language social networking website, mainly popular in Iran. After the locally (and internationally) popular social networking website Orkut was blocked by the Iranian government, a series of local sites and networks, including Cloob, emerged to fill the gap.\n\n; {{w|Kaixin001}}\n\n: A social networking website which ranks as the 13th most popular website in China and 67th overall.\n\n; {{w|Piczo}}\n\n: A privately held blog website for teens.

Club Penguin is aimed towards children. It has been shut down near the end of March 2017.\n\n; [https://maplestory.nexon.net/ Maple Story]\n\n: This is an MMO that has a more natural setting. The most distinguishing feature of Maple Story is its cartoony pixel art.\n\n; [https://www.gamefaqs.com/ GameFAQs]\n\n: While this is not an MMO, it is a website that has the largest repository of walkthoughs, that is, guides that help someone beat a game. GameFAQs is notable for not only its large repository of walkthroughs of games that are across an extreme variety of consoles, handhelds, and even computers (not all of them MMOs), but also the drama that is rumoured to happen in the GameFAQs forums.\n\n; [https://www.ign.com/ IGN]\n\n: While this is also not an MMO, it is the largest website that gives news on video games in general, not just MMOs. Each of the games mentioned in the site have pages that have summaries, reviews, screenshots, other art, videos, and links to news related to its games.\n\n; [https://www.playonline.com/ff11us/index.shtml FFXI]\n\n: Final Fantasy XI is an MMO from SquareEnix, being the first MMO of the popular ''Final Fantasy'' series.\n\n; [https://www.runescape.com/community Runescape]\n\n: This is an older MMO.\n\n; [https://us.battle.net/sc2/en/ Starcraft II]\n\n: A realtime strategy game with a science fiction setting that heavily involves space travel. While technically not an MMO, it has a significant online multiplayer component.\n\n; [https://us.battle.net/wow/en/ WoW]\n\n: World of Warcraft is the definitive MMO, being not only the most popular and one of the longest-running but also the most expansive (having its own spinoff games, comic books, novels, and even figurines), WOW giving the idea of how an MMO should be. A player can choose from a variety of races, each with its own heavy history.\n\n; [https://secondlife.com/ Second Life]\n\n: This is similar to Habbo, albeit with a bigger suspension of disbelief (one example being that the player does not need to be a human) and in a 3D setting. \n\n; [https://www.nationstates.net/ NationStates]\n\n: A text-based political simulation game. Notably, some of its traffic comes not from the actual game (which is optional), but the extensive set of political, roleplaying, and general forums attached.\n\n; [https://www.urbandead.com/ Urban Dead]\n\n: It described itself as \"A Massively Multi-Player Web-Based Zombie Apocalypse\", which sums it up pretty well.

Its most notable feature is the heavy customization possible of a member's pixel-art avatar. Its members tend to roleplay a lot, albeit in a more written, story-based form. Gaia has gained a reputation with its members stealing art and causing drama. The ferry that links the gaia island with 4chan was most likely due to the \"boxxy\" row, where vlogger boxxy posted videos of her using gaia, which then were circulated on 4chan. This resulted in a division of the sites users, and many more hacking attacks, including a DDOS attack on 4chan itself.\n\n; [https://www.everquest.com EverQuest]\n\n: EverQuest is one of the first MMO's, it's still running and has a huge number of expansions.\n\n; [https://www.uo.com UO]\n\n: Ultima Online along with EverQuest this was one of the first and longest running MMO's.\n\n; {{w|City of Heroes|CoH}}\n\n: City of Heroes was a superhero-based MMORPG that was shut down November 2012.\n\n; [https://atlantica.nexon.net/ Atlantica]\n\n: Atlantica Online is a turn-based MMORPG.\n\n; [https://lineage.plaync.com/ Lineage]\n\n: A Korean MMORPG, its North American servers were closed 2011/06/29 due to being unprofitable.\n\n; [https://www.lineage2.com/en/ Lineage II]\n\n: A Korean MMORPG, mainly played in Asia along with its predecessor.

The servers have been shut down, but it continues to operate through the work of fans. It's widely considered an early entry into the MMO genre due to its unprecedentedly high player count.\n\nOther notable regions include:\n\n; The Mountains of Steam\n\n: Referring to the game distribution service [https://store.steampowered.com/ Steam] where people can buy and download video games in general, not just MMOs. There is also an extensive [https://steamcommunity.com/ community] where users can share content, and instant messaging chat by text, voice, or game streaming.\n\n; River Grind\n\n: Refers to \"grinding\". In most MMOs, the character is a fighter of some sorts, yet starts at a level 1, signifying the character's aptitude level in combat. The character can level up and gain more aptitude levels through earning experience, of which the most reliable and otherwise common way is the process of \"grinding,\" that is, repeatedly fighting opposing monsters (sometimes of a level notably lower that your character's), gaining experience points from winning these battles until your character gains a level, that is, \"levels up\". While a practical necessity in strengthening the character, this process can be tiresome, hence the expression \"grinding.\"\n\n; Spawn Camp\n\n: Refers to \"spawn points\", the places where AI-powered enemies and players who have died in-game respawn, and the act of \"spawn camping\", in which the player character simply stands behind or around the spawn points to fight the enemy creatures or respawning players as soon as they appear.\n\n; Gulf of Lag\n\n: Refers to how the MMO can be slowed down a considerable amount due to the large amount of players simultaneously using the same server, this congestion bogging down the server and frustrating the users.\n\n; [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/final-boss-of-the-internet End Guy for the Internet]\n\n: Refers to \"end bosses,\" the last — and usually hardest to defeat — \"bad guy\" in a game (or a section of a game).\n\n----\n\n===YouTube Region===\nThe YouTube region refers to websites that are based on user-created content.\n\n; [https://www.youtube.com/ YouTube]\n\n: This is the definitive video website where people can upload videos with the purpose of public viewing, ranging from home movies through official music videos through Let's Plays of people playing video games to questionably-legal uploads of cartoons and films. Google had purchased YouTube.\n\nMany of the sites on the map are just references to {{w|viral video}}s at {{w|YouTube}}:\n\n; Viral Shores\n\n: Refers to how viral videos (whether they be viral marketing or simply memes)  tend to proliferate on YouTube.\n\n; Britney\n\n: This likely refers to pop singer {{w|Britney Spears}} and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc‎ \"Leave Britney Alone\" guy].\n\n; Maru Gulf\n\n: Refers to Maru the Cat, a YouTube celebrity [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/676:_Abstraction also mentioned in xkcd].\n\n; Prairie Dog Habitat\n\n: This likely refers to the viral video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw Dramatic Chipmunk] (which is actually a Prairie Dog).\n\n; Rick Rolling Hills\n\n: References {{w|Rickrolling}}.

The \"deserted\" note likely refers to how Rick Astley himself is tired of the meme, or again, how people tend to leave the video upon getting \"Rick Roll'd,\" never actually going to the video with the express purpose of viewing the video.

Of course, by the time the comic was written, HTML 5 was still in its infancy. The Music Video Bay refers to the amount of music videos (official or otherwise) are present in YouTube.\n\nOther counties of the YouTube region include:\n\n; [https://vimeo.com/ Vimeo]\n\n: A website where people tend to showcase artistic content that they made on their own, notably independent studios.\n\n; [https://secure.flickr.com/ Flickr]\n\n: A website where people can upload and share photographs they took.\n\n; [https://fotolog.com Fotolog]\n\n: A photo website very popular in South America in 2004-2008, which was used as a social network.\n\n; [https://www.last.fm/ Last.fm]\n\n: A music website that uses a music recommender system known as \"Audioscrobbler\".

While many big-name/professional people and organizations have their works in deviantArt, the site is more infamous for the large amount of people who upload low-quality fan-art and fan-characters, most notably of media from Japan. Another point of infamy is the large amount of drama that can happen in the website.\n\n; [https://www.newgrounds.com/ Newgrounds]\n\n: A website that hosts art, (Flash-based) videos, audio, and (Flash-based) games to which other users can comment and rate.

The most distinguishing feature is the ability to \"reblog\" these posts from other's people's blogs into the user's own blog. Notable features of Tumblr include sketchblogs (where people upload their sketches), Ask blogs (where people answer questions other users ask, the moderators of these blogs usually pretending to be a character from a form of media), and the large amount of \"social justice\" (a highly controversial political movement). (See also [[1043: Ablogalypse]].)\n\n; {{w|b3ta}}\n\n: A popular British website, described as a \"puerile digital arts community\" by The Guardian.\n\n; The Isle of teenagers who just discovered macroeconomics\n\n: A joke about how teenagers tend to think that the world and the economy are a lot simpler than they actually are.

He is very much vilified because of his rather feminine appearance and his hordes of fans (called \"Beliebers\") that seem to support him to ridiculous extents. Lately, though, Justin Beiber has taken a \"bad boy\" attitude because of all the Beliebers who are willing to defend him no matter what, him partaking in a lot of questionable activities that include tattoos, questionably-legal substances, and buying prostitution, thus lowering his popularity in the general populace.\n\n; {{w|Google Buzz}}\n\n: A former social network attempted by Google.  It has since been shut down.\n\n; Bit.Ly Mountains\n\n: A reference to the URL shortening service {{w|bit.ly}}.\n\n; Kanye's Isle of Sadness\n\n: A reference to the musician {{w|Kanye West}}, whose Twitter, at the time, was [https://www.buzzfeed.com/mlew15/25-of-kanye-wests-most-thought-provoking-tweets-h0se famously introspective and stream-of-consciousness].\n\n; Sarah Palin USA\n\n: This is the Twitter handle of former politician {{w|Sarah Palin}}.\n\n; Clueless Politician Coast\n\n: A reference to the number of politicians on Twitter and other social networks who repeatedly share clueless updates that more often create an uproar than help their election chances.\n\n; Desert of Food Updates\n\n: A reference to the number of pictures of food that are shared on social media (especially Twitter).

Waves\n\n: A pun on the fact that so many people used the word \"Breaking\" at the beginning of tweets that do not warrant that tag that the word has lost most of its meaning and become a joke.  It is a pun because waves \"break\" on the shore.\n\n; Web 3.0\n\n: Refers to the unofficial term {{w|Web 2.0}}. In this case, \"Web 1.0\" refers to websites that give information to users. Web 2.0 refers to websites where the users themselves create content. Web 3.0 has sometimes been used as a term for {{w|semantic web}}, a machine-readable version of the web, but this usage is far from universal.\n\n; Hashtag games whose popularity confuses and depresses you\n\n: Refers to the game where a user posts something under a particular hashtag and others respond with their own ideas, all tagged under the same phrase.

These often allow services like voice chat and even video calls.\n\n; {{w|Skype}}\n\n: According to Randall, Skype is the most popular of these among the internet. It has many features to allow peer-to-peer voice chats, as well as allowing calls to be made at a price to actual phones.\n\n; {{w|AIM}}\n\n: AOL Instant Messenger is a chat client created by AOL.\n\n; GG\n\n: {{w|Gadu-Gadu}} is an instant messenger client popular in Poland.\n\n; {{w|Yahoo Messenger}}\n\n: This is an instant messenger client by Yahoo.\n\n; {{w|Google Talk}}\n\n: A voice/video chatting service from Google (that Google has been replacing with Hangouts).

MSN was useful in that people could draw and send pictures to other chatters.\n\n; {{w|Usenet}}\n\n: This was one of the original ways to communicate on the internet, though people can download (copyrighted) files through the service. Since it is still in use by some, it gets the tag \"Still Around!\" on the map.\n\n; {{w|IRC}} Isles\n\n: Refers to the ancestor of Internet-powered chatting. People would have connected to a server and spoke publicly. IRC is still in use (as of 2014), notably in getting help from other users. One of those isles is #xkcd which is an IRC community around [[xkcd]].\n\n----\n\n===Bay of Drama===\n\n; {{w|FanFiction.net}}\n\n: A website where people can submit their fanfiction (stories by fans written about other peoples' media, normally that about popular media). The website tends to have people that are not helpful to those who legitimately want critique of their own stories.\n\n; {{w|Xanga}}\n\n: A blogging service that, while popular at its time, lost out to...\n\n; {{w|LiveJournal}}\n\n: This was the most popular blogging service before Tumblr.\n\n; ONYD\n\n: Reference to {{w|Oh No You Didn't}}, which is explained in the Blogosphere region.\n\n; {{w|Dreamwidth}}\n\n: A LiveJournal fork emphasizing its open-source nature.\n\n----\n\n===Blogosphere===\nThe Blogosphere region contains several general {{w|blog}} topics.\n\n; {{w|photo blog|Photo Blogs}}\n\n: These are commonly used to chronicle the lives of the authors through photographs.\n\n; Diary Blogs\n\n: These are another popular use of blogs (and, in fact, the original use) where authors write commentary about their lives.\n\n; Bay of Grammar Pedantry\n\n: This deals with the fact that, whether due to a lack of proper education, a habit of using \"chat-speak\" in the text-limited SMS and MMS, or simply due to the (generally) more relaxed nature of the Internet, blog authors tend to write with horrible composition, a point of annoyment to a lot of other people due to the subsequent increased difficulty of reading the horribly-written material.\n\n; Fandom Blogs\n\n: These are blogs created by a \"{{w|fandom}}\" which is a community of fans. A fandom blog deals with the subject matter of the respective fandom.\n\n; Sea of Zero (0) Comments\n\n: Refers to blogs that get very little attention and therefore have no comments.\n\n; SpamBlog Straits\n\n: References spammers who use blogs to increase the number of links to their site to try to game search engines.\n\n; OffTopic.com\n\n: A general interest forum that refers to itself as \"the largest general discussion forum on the internet.\"\n\n; Blog Blogs\n\n: These can refer to blogs that talk about the matter about blogging itself, though they can also refer to blogs which authors use in talking about blogging.\n\nMany more straightforward blogs, including:\n\n* Writing/Poetry\n\n* Gossip Blogs\n\n* Political Blogs\n\n* Music Blogs\n\n* Tech Blogs\n\n* Business Blogs\n\n* Corporate Blogs\n\n* Religious Blogs\n\n* Miscellaneous Blogs\n\n----\n\n===Blogosphere (Core Region)===\nGossip Blogs.

The community focuses on celebrity gossip and pop culture with most of its posts aggregated from other gossip blogs.\n\n; Doucheblog\n\n: Refers to blogs that were once insightful but that spiraled into long rants due to relationship changes of their authors.\n\n; Isle of Mockery\n\n: A reference to the fact that some of what these blogs do is mock celebrities or other for doing or saying stupid things on camera.\n\nLiberal Blogs. Each blog below focuses on American political news with a \"liberal\" or \"progressive\" slant.  These blogs tend to lean for the Democratic party.\n\n; {{w|Huffington Post}}\n\n: A news blog.\n\n; {{w|Paul Krugman}}\n\n: This is an American economist who considers himself a liberal.\n\n; {{w|Daily Beast}}\n\n: A news and opinion website focusing on politics and pop culture.\n\n; {{w|Talking Points Memo|TPM}}\n\n: A political journal run by Josh Marshall.\n\n; {{w|Ezra Klein}}\n\n: He used to have his own site at the Washington Post, but is now the editor of [Vox.com]. \n\n; {{w|Think Progress}}\n\n: A political news blog.\n\n; {{w|Daily Kos|Kos}}\n\n: Another political blog.\n\nBay of Flame:\n\n; {{w|Politics Daily}}\n\n: A political journalism website launched by AOL.\n\n; CNN Political Ticker\n\n: This is CNN's political blog.\n\n; {{w|Mediaite}}\n\n: A news and opinion blog covering politics and entertainment in the media.\n\n; {{w|NY Times}}\n\n: This is one of the most famous newspapers, thus the comparatively large size of its island.\n\n; {{w|The Talk}}\n\n: A talk show on CBS that discusses the latest headlines \"through the eyes of mothers.\"\n\n; Libertarian Isle\n\n: Shaped like a {{w|Nolan Chart}}.\n\nConservative Blogs: \nEach blog below focuses on American political news with a \"conservative\" or Republican slant.\n\n; {{w|Pajamas Media}}\n\n: A media company and operator of conservative news.\n\n; {{w|Michelle Malkin}}\n\n: A conservative blogger, political commentator, and author.\n\n; {{w|Hot Air}}\n\n: A news blog founded by Michelle Malkin.\n\n; {{w|RedState|Red State}}\n\n: A political blog.\n\n; {{w|American Thinker}}\n\n: A daily online magazine focused on politics.\n\n; {{w|Townhall}}\n\n: A web publication and print magazine.\n\nTech blogs:\n\n; {{w|Boy Genius Report}}\n\n: A weblog that focuses on technology and consumer gadgets.\n\n; {{w|Gizmodo}}\n\n: A news and opinion blog, hosted by Gawker, that talks about life's more technological matters.\n\n; {{w|Engadget}}\n\n: Another technology-oriented, albeit independent, blog.\n\n; Crunchgear\n\n: A blog that reviews gadgets and other hardware.\n\n; {{w|Techcrunch}}\n\n: This is an online publisher of technology industry news.\n\n; {{w|Joystiq}}\n\n: A news and opinion blog that focuses on gaming.\n\n; {{w|Kotaku}}\n\n: Another gaming-oriented news/opinion blog, the main difference being that Kotaku is owned by Gawker. \n\nAssorted:\n\n; {{w|BoingBoing}}\n\n: This is \"i blog about wonderful things\", the topics being quite random.\n\n; {{w|Lifehacker}}\n\n: Another Gawker blog, is a blog that teaches people how to simplify their lives through 'lifehacking', that is, using their resources in creative wayss.

It has since been acquired by Gawker\n\n; Meatorama\n\n: A blog that talks about cooking meat.\n\n----\n\n===QQ Region===\n\n; Baidu Baike\n\n: \"Baidu Encyclopedia\" and \"Interactive Encyclopedia\" are two Chinese online encyclopedias. Baidu Baike is powered by the same company as Baidu, the search engine popular in China.\n\n; The Ma Le Ge Bi and The Grass Mud Horse Bay\n\n: These refer to the {{w|Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures}}.\n\n; The Location of Jia Junpeng\n\n: This refers to the Internet meme of {{w|Jia Junpeng}} in 2009 in China.\n\n; {{w|Tencent QQ}}\n\n: A Chinese instant messaging program. In English communities \"QQ\" has several more common definitions. It can be an {{w|emoticon}}, representing a face with two large, crying eyes, or a synonym for \"rage quit\", in which a video game player quits the game out of sheer frustration. It originated in ''Warcraft II'' multiplayer, where pressing Ctrl+Q+Q would quit the game, and became more widely known in ''World of Warcraft''. These definitions are commonly combined, usually to mock the \"rage quitter\".\n\n; River Crabs\n\n: River Crabs is a {{w|Euphemisms for Internet censorship in China|euphemism for internet censorship in China}}. The Gulf of China refers to how sites in the region are based in People's Republic of China (\"Red China\"). \n\n; The Great Firewall\n\n: Refers to {{w|The Great Firewall of China}}, a pun on {{w|The Great Wall of China}}. Similar to how The Great Wall of China was meant to keep intruding nations out of the then-capital of the city, The Great Firewall of China is meant to keep visitors from visiting censored websites. Oddly other Chinese websites (Qzone, Renren etc.) are not enclosed in this zone. It also resembles the {{w|Nine-Dash Line}} commonly drawn on Chinese maps that indicates a vague territorial claim.\n\n----\n\n===Forums Islands===\nForums are websites where one person post a topic to which other people can discuss. While the map has a zoomed in version, this article shall discuss the two bigger islands, first.\n\n; [https://www.2ch.net 2channel]\n\n: A Japanese imageboard that was actually the original inspiration for 4chan.\n\n; [https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites Craigslist]\n\n: A classified advertisement website with sections devoted to just about everything... which formerly included prostitution services, hence The Former Site of Adult Services\n\nIn the zoomed-in map, there is the following:\n\n; [https://www.4chan.org/ 4chan.org]\n\n: This is an {{w|imageboard}} in which people can upload pictures while others comment on them. The website is infamous for its loose/often non-existent rules, incredibly vulgar userbase, source of new memes, and spawning of trolls. 4chan's random board, known internally as '''/b/''', is almost constantly flooded with porn and image macros. This is why Randall's incarnation of 4chan is roughly shaped like a penis.\n\n; 420chan and 7chan\n\n: Other imageboards in the style of 4chan. Their relative lack of popularity and derivative nature leads a lot of 4chan users to mock them, hence, their position on Randall's map suggests that they're mere wads of semen.\n\n; Encyclopedia Dramatica\n\n: Labeled ED on the map, is a wiki site dedicated to chronicling internet memes and other noteworthy sites, events, people, and anything else that catches their attention, generally in a very satirical manner. The site is heavily populated by 4chan users. Many people are offended by the articles and talks that go on in the wiki and forum, which is perhaps the reason that it appears to be represented as a wad of sperm. The image of sperm also makes sense since ED is used as a messaging center for the group \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group) Anonymous]\" which is represented in the map as part of the testicles of the 4chan island(see below at the gulf named Anonymous).\n\n; Tunnel to Habbo\n\n: A reference to [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pools-closed the 2006 Habbo Hotel Raids], in which hundreds of 4chan Anons simultaneously logged onto Habbo Hotel and proceeded to be as obnoxious as possible, standing in formations of swastikas and penises or body-blocking the swimming pools.\n\n; {{w|Catbus}} Route\n\n: This is likely a reference to {{w|Lolcat}}s in general.\n\n; [https://www.ebaumsworld.com/ eBaum's World]\n\n: A media-hosting website founded by Eric Bauman. The site has lost a lot of traffic after (quite valid) accusations of stolen content.\n\n; The gulf labeled {{w|Anonymous (group)|Anonymous}}\n\n: This is most likely a reference to the leaderless, anonymous international network called \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group) Anonymous]\" which is composed of (mainly)  anarchic activist hackers. Anonymous  was created on the /b/ messaging board of 4chan, hence why the bay of Anonymous is on the coast of /b/. Also, the fact that the bay is in the \"testicles\"(/b/) of the 4chan island \"penis\" is referring to how Anonymous was created on 4chan, in the same way that sperm is created in the testicles of a penis, possibly a subtle jab at the group.\n\nTo the south and east is an archipelago of islands representing various regional and special-interest forums. Moving clockwise from 4chan island is\n\n; Storm 2K\n\n: This is an online website hosting information on tropical cyclones and tools for tracking them, and has a forum with multiple categories and threads for discussion on tropical cyclones, as well as multiple tropical cyclone models and reconnaissance information.\n\n; Skyscraper city\n\n: This is an internet forum website for skyscraper hobbyists and enthusiasts.\n\nAn island containing two websites related to women, namely\n\n; Wizaz.pl\n\n: A Polish website, presumably for women, with a forum filled with discussions mainly about beauty, health, women, hobbies, and fun.\n\n; Baby and bump\n\n: A self-described \"pregnancy forum, baby and parenting community\".\n\nAn island contaning:\n\n; ForoCoches\n\n: A very popular Spanish (as in from Spain) forum mainly about automobiles, but holds discussions on virtually any topic.\n\n; Bodybuilding.com\n\n: A website for bodybuilders. It contains a forum for general discussions on bodybuilding that includes topics such as supplements, exercises, and nutrition.\n\n; Bokt.nl\n\n: It calls itself the largest community on the topic of horses. A Dutch website, it holds topics about virtually anything involving horses.\n\n; Cruise Critic\n\n: A website with a large forum about cruises in general.\n\n; Lay it low\n\n: A website for discussing lowriding(changing a car so that its ground clearance go lower than the clearance of the original design from the manufacturer.\n\n; [https://www.twoplustwo.com/ Two plus two]\n\n: A poker & gambling forum\n\nAn island containing:\n\n; [https://www.facethejury.us/ Face the jury]\n\n: This is an online forum, originally founded for users to upload pictures of themselves to be judged by other users\n\nA smaller nearby island is Datalounge\n\nAn island containing gaming-related sites:\n\n* D2JSP\n\n* EA UK\n\n* Gametrailers\n\nSmaller islands next to the D2JSP island are\n\n* Steam powered\n\n* World of players\n\n* Nedgaf\n\n* Overclock\n\nA smaller island of regional and special-interest forums:\n\n; [https://digitalspy.com/ Digital Spy]\n\n: A British media and entertainment news service\n\n; [https://www.onliner.by/ onliner.by]\n\n: A Belarusian digital technology forum\n\nZona Ford\n\n; [https://lowyat.net/ lowyat]\n\n: A large Malaysian technology forum\n\n; [https://www.macrumors.com/ MacRumors]\n\n: An Apple news and discussion site\n\nAdjacent to this, an island labelled\n\n; [https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/ Whirlpool Forums]\n\n: A large Australian broadband and technology forum. The drawing reflects Australia being an island continent separated from other countries.\n\nAn island made up of several European forums:\n\n; [https://www.jlaforums.com/ JLA Forums]\n\n: JLA Forums\n\n; [https://www.fok.nl/ fok.nl]\n\n: A Dutch forum site that is one of the largest internet communities in the Netherlands\n\n; [https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/ The Student Room]\n\n: A British forum and wiki for secondary and tertiary students\n\n; [https://www.boards.ie/ boards.ie]\n\n: \"Now Ye're talking\", a popular Irish forum site\n\n; [https://www.forum.hr/ forum.hr]\n\n: A Croatian forum\n\n; rus-chat\n\n: Possibly a reference to [https://rus-chat.de/ rus-chat.de]\n\nThe largest single-site island is [https://www.somethingawful.com/ SomethingAwful], a website that is meant to showcase all things \"awful\". SomethingAwful also has a large trollbase, but they tend to be more honorable than the ones from Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan. One example is there being a spotty holding of the no-furries rule in the forums. The forums themselves are famous because of the holding of the Let's Plays of [https://lparchive.org/Dangan-Ronpa/ Dangan Ronpa] and [https://danganronpa2mirror.tumblr.com/ Super Dangan Ronpa 2], which had cooked up public interest to the point of there being an English-language release of the games. (Note that, due to these Let's Plays being in a forums that frequently hides behind a \"paywall\" that requires a paid account before accessing, the links provided go to their mirrors.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''Map of Online Communities'''\n:Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the Spring and Summer of 2010.\n\n:[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]\n\n:[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is \"Facebook\" - with large states in the south-east of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.\n\n:A peninsula on the south-west, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the south-east of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the south-west part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.\n\n:The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.\n\n:In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmville and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.\n\n:To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.\n\n:East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)\n\n:To the southwest of Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]\n\n:[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and /b/. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]\n\n:[The northeastern third of Gossip/Political/Tech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.] \n\n:[Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.]\n:ABOUT THIS MAP\n:Communities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing, sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some comparing of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.\n\n:Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leaf reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).\n\n:Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wikipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic used to be [https://web.archive.org/web/20220125023117/https://store.xkcd.com/products/online-communities-poster available as a poster] in the xkcd store before it was [[Store|shut down]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Online Communities]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Large drawings]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Rickrolling]]\n[[Category:Comics with xkcd store products]]\n[[Category:Sysadmins]]\n[[Category:Disney]]\n[[Category:Online Communities]]"
