It's me, Margaret.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe {{w|Heartbleed bug}} was, at the time of publication of this comic, receiving a lot of news coverage recently and was also the topic of the previous comic [[1353: Heartbleed]]. This comic explains how the bug may have been discovered and can be exploited to reveal a server's memory contents. \n\nA [[Megan]]-like character named Margaret (or \"Meg\") sends heartbeat requests to the server, the server responds to the heartbeat request by returning the contents of the body of the request up to the number of letters requested. The first two requests are well formed, requesting exactly the number of characters in the request body. The server's memory is showing Meg's request with many other requests going on at the same time.\n\nMeg then ponders this and tries to submit another request asking for \"HAT\" but requests that it be 500 letters long instead of only 3; the server —not checking it or simply unaware that 500 letters is larger than the request body— returns \"HAT\" plus 497 letters that happened to be next to the word \"HAT\" in its memory (more will follow than are shown in the server's speech bubble as there are only 251 letters/symbols in the shown reply). Included are many sensitive bits of information, including a master key and user passwords. One of the passwords shown is \"CoHoBaSt\", a reference to [[936: Password Strength]], which suggests using \"<u>co</u>rrect <u>ho</u>rse <u>ba</u>ttery <u>st</u>aple\" as a password.\n\nOften popular explanations of security bugs require the issue to be simplified a lot and to leave out a lot of details. In this case [[Randall]] didn't have to do much simplifying; the bug is actually that simple. Also, any client that can connect to the server can typically exploit this bug in the underlying {{w|OpenSSL}} software — the use of the term \"User Meg\" does not imply that Meg had to authenticate first.\n\nAlthough Randall shows Meg recording the data by hand, on paper, it is more likely that a person exploiting the bug would have a computer record the data, perhaps on its hard drive or on a flash drive. However one could argue that such a person would not communicate to the server by speaking out loud either.\n\nThe title text is a reference to ''{{w|Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.}}'', a novel by {{w|Judy Blume}}, and plays off of the \"server, are you still there?\" line in every panel where she did start a request. The novel is the theme of another comic [[1544: Margaret]] too. ''Meg'' can be a nickname for ''Margaret'' as well as ''[[Megan]]'' whom Margaret resembles.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panels:]\n:'''How the Heartbleed Bug works:'''\n\n:[Meg, a girl with more curly hair than Megan, stands to the left in a panel. At the center of the panel is a black and gray server with red and green diode lights showing. During all six panels the server stays the same. Meg is standing with her arms down in four panels. It will be noted when she does not. Meg talks to the server. The server \"thinks\" all the time, i.e. we see its memory in all panels. The top and bottom line is breaking the edge of the thought bubble making it difficult to discern. In every second panel it replies to Meg. In these panels the number of letters requested by Meg is highlighted with yellow color.]\n\n:[Meg speaks, server thinks:]\n:Meg: Server, are you still there?
