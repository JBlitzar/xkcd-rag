She tells him that at the apex of his swing, he'll become weightless. Cueball then imagines that at the peak of his swing, he is able to become permanently weightless, floating above the ground without any support.\n\nWhen on a swing or other [http://www.learner.org/interactives/parkphysics/pendulum.html pendulum rides], there is a moment between swinging up and swinging back down when the forces of gravity, friction, air resistance, etc., bring the velocity and normal force of the swing to zero. At this moment, there is no acceleration toward the pivot of the swing (since the centripetal acceleration is proportional to the square of the speed). So the swinger experiences no centripetal force. Of course, gravity still acts on the person, but if the swing is horizontal at that point, then there is no reaction force, so for one moment, the swinger is in free-fall and experiences {{w|weightlessness}}. However, that weightlessness can only be maintained for a fraction of a second, so if Cueball tried this in real life, he would come crashing to the ground. \n\nIn the title text, Cueball asks for a pocket fan, believing he could fly around the yard using this small device as a propeller. By using the fan to blow air in the opposite direction he wishes to travel, he could perhaps use the reaction force to push himself around. Note that this form of travel does not work at high altitudes because it works by pushing air molecules, which decrease in concentration at high altitudes. Another method of propulsion could be [https://what-if.xkcd.com/21/ machine guns]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Woman talking to Cueball on swing-set.]\n:Woman: You know, at the peak of a big swing, you become weightless.\n:[Thought bubble from Cueball.]\n:[Cueball swings higher and higher.
