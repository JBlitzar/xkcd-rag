Technology's going to be so cool. All in all, the future will be okay! Except climate; we fucked that one up.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe title of this comic is a reference to the dystopian comedy ''{{w|Idiocracy}}''. The film postulates that over about 500 years, society will suffer from a massive decrease in intellectual potential. This development is implied to be due to the fact that people are more likely to reproduce due to lack of education, absence of planning, and general negligence with regards to the consequences of their actions. \n\n[[Cueball]] professes his approval for the theories represented in the film, and the guy with the white safari hat agrees with him, arguing that \"the intelligent, upper classes\" had previously had more children, but that this trend has reversed, dragging down intelligence and education levels. (Note that Safari Hat is not the same guy as [[White Hat]]! See below.)\n\nBut in panel 3, Safari Hat suddenly reveals that all the \"facts\" he cited were wrong, and we learn that he doesn't support the dysgenic thesis at all. He turns to accuse Cueball of conceited self-righteousness (using religious zealots as an analogy), harshly condemning intelligence dysgenics as an excuse for feeling superior to the rest of society. Cueball tries to rebut Safari Hat's arguments, but is cut off both times. From what we see of his words, he may be trying to use his dislike for modern popular entertainment as support for his thesis, and appears to suggest a compulsory eugenic breeding program. The latter appears to particularly upset Safari Hat, as he responds with his most direct insult: it would be better to reproduce with a stupid person than an elitist like Cueball.\n\nIt's pretty clear here that [[Randall]] is voicing his opinion through Safari Hat, and using Cueball as a straw man.\n\nThe title text reflects the opinion. It makes a few generally optimistic comments on the future, but then finishes on a rather sour note about {{w|climate change}}. Climate change is a [[:Category:Climate change|recurring theme]] in xkcd.\n\nSafari Hat's initial claim was clearly designed to include only false statements that might sound true to someone who wanted to believe them: there's always been a trend for poorer and less educated to have more children, it wasn't different in the past (and there's some evidence that this correlation is becoming less reliable with changes in culture, opportunities for women, and the availability of birth control). The claim that IQs and education are decreasing is also false: educational attainment has been rising for decades in all developed countries. Measured IQs have also  risen, but this is a more complex picture. Whether this is a shift in actual intelligence or just an artifact of how it's measured remains a topic of debate, and the rise in IQ scores appears to have stopped and even reversed across multiple countries. Still, studies have refuted the notion that a decline in IQ is being caused by a {{w|dysgenic}} effect, meaning that the central thesis of ''Idiocracy'' remains entirely fictional. \n\nThe irony, of course, is that Cueball is implicitly holds himself up as an example of intelligence (standing in contrast to the social decline in intelligence) and yet shows himself to be badly misinformed about the topic he's discussing. \n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in front of three shelves with DVDs, holding a single DVD in his hand looking at the cover. A guy with a white rounded safari hat (Safari Hat from now on) stands behind him.]\n:Cueball: ''Idiocracy'' is so true.\n:Safari Hat: I know, right? It used to be that the intelligent, upper classes had more children.\n\n:[Zoom in on their heads as Cueball turns towards Safari Hat.]\n:Safari Hat: Sadly, the recent reversal of this trend has dragged IQ scores and average education steadily downward.\n:Cueball: Depressing, huh?\n\n:[Zoom out to show Cueball holding the DVD down as Safari Hat lifts on arm towards him.]\n:Safari Hat: Yeah, except ''everything I just said was wrong.''\n:Cueball: Huh?\n:Safari Hat: Wrong. False. The opposite of true.\n\n:[Zoom in only on Safari Hat.]\n:Safari Hat: You're like the religious zealots who are ''burdened'' by their superiority with the sad duty of decrying the ''obvious'' moral decay of each new generation.\n:Safari Hat: And you're just as wrong.\n\n:[Zoom out to both as before, but this time it is Cueball who holds up a finger.]\n:Cueball: But look at how popular—\n:Safari Hat: More harm has been done by people panicked over societal decline than societal decline ever did.\n\n:[Cueball spreads out his arms (the DVD gone) as Safari Hat has walked out off the panel.]\n:Cueball: Look — all we need is a program that limits breeding to—\n:Safari Hat (off-panel): New theory: Stupid people reproduce more because the alternative is sleeping with ''you.''\n\n==Trivia==\nSafari Hat was at first thought to be a version of White Hat, who had the exact opposite personality, depicted here. But since White Hat had already appeared three times before this comic, and as Safari hat has never been seen since (except in [[1000: 1000 Comics]]), there is no reason to mix these two characters.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]"
