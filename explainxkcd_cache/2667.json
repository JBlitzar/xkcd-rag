He read a discussion about {{w|Green Day}}, asked who they are, and was told that not knowing was a serious problem. As Megan says, judging people for lack of pop culture knowledge has remained typical online behavior. \n\nGreen Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987.  In 1993, they were still known merely as an independent punk band, and a year away from releasing their major-label debut album ''{{w|Dookie}}'', their first mainstream success. Anyone, especially a nine year-old, not recognizing the band in 1993 would be perfectly normal.{{cn}} After 1993, Green Day would go on to be a widely popular and influential rock band with many acclaimed albums.\n\nThis initial online social interaction was a significant formative experience for Cueball, molding his online behavior ever since, in that it still causes him to consider his correspondents' perspectives when communicating. The social dynamics at play are reminiscent of the mathematics of others' perspectives described in [[1053: Ten Thousand]]. Relating the personal experience of an oversized effect from a casual insult is humorous because the extent to which early experiences affect people can be both ironic and profound.\n\nThe title text indicates Cueball agrees with the reply to the question. This is humorous because it is effectively Cueball admitting that something is very wrong with him, possibly coincidental with and unrelated to knowing that specific piece of trivia. Alternatively, Cueball could have come to believe Green Day is culturally important. If this story is autobiographical, Randall could have hence become a Green Day fan, or at least acquired more than a passing knowledge of their {{w|Å“uvre}}, recently mentioning their song \"{{w|American Idiot (song)|American Idiot}}\" in [[2665: America Songs]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[First panel, Megan and Cueball talking]\n:Cueball: You know,\n:Cueball: I remember the first thing anybody ever said to me on the internet.\n:Megan: Yeah?\n\n:[Second panel, part-height to accomodate Cueball's narration above and the memory of a scene below that features 'Young Cueball', with a mop-head of hair, knelt atop a chair to use a computer with CRT and keyboard on the desk, cabled down into a floor-standing minitower case below]\n:Cueball (narrative): I was in an AOL Kids chat room in 1993.\n:Cueball (narrative): People there kept using a name I didn't recognise.\n:Cueball (narrative): After a while I asked what it was.\n:Young Cueball (via the use of the keyboard): W...H...O... &nbsp;I...S... &nbsp;G...R...\n\n:[Third panel, close-up of Cueball's adult head, continuing the framing conversation]\n:Cueball: Someone replied.\n:Cueball: \"If you don't know who Green Day is, you have a serious problem.\"\n:Cueball: And that was it.
