The comic was posted before the NASA press conference was held, although speculation about the announcement had already occurred.\n\nThe \"questions\" portion of the press conference is derailed by [[Beret Guy]], acting as a reporter for a network known only as \"The News\". He first comments he is holding a microphone so he is \"real loud now.\" He then asks how the data about Mars relates to data in other fields like medicine and sports. This may seem like an intelligent question upon first glance, but it is in fact nonsensical.  Afterwards he asks if Mars has been \"ruined\" by getting wet, or if Mars will be okay when it dries out. Some things, e.g. indoor furniture, can be damaged by water, but Mars is not one of those things. When asked if he has any other questions he asks why {{w|Luke Skywalker}} was being hassled at the {{w|Mos Eisley Cantina}} in ''{{w|Star Wars}}''. ([https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cornelius_Evazan Dr. Evazan] and [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ponda_Baba Ponda Baba] simply told Luke that \"[they] don't like [him]\", but Beret Guy is evidently not satisfied by that explanation.) Although this may be somewhat space-related, NASA is not an organization that explains films, whether or not they are space related. The other reporters forget their original questions and join in on the irrelevant discussion, much to the dismay of the NASA scientist.\n\nThis is probably meant to mock previous NASA press conferences, where reporters have asked inane questions that reveal their total ignorance of the field.\n\nThe title text refers to [[Elon Musk]], who suggested [https://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/11/us/elon-musk-mars-nuclear-bomb-colbert-feat/ nuking Mars] as a faster way of warming it up to make it habitable. This would certainly be a cheaper way of ruining Mars, as one nuclear warhead can do much more damage than many rovers.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing behind a lectern with the NASA logo on it.]\n:Cueball: That concludes the press conference. Any questions?\n:Cueball: Yes, you, from... it just says \"The News\"?\n\n:[Beret Guy is standing in a crowd holding a microphone.]\n:Beret Guy: Hi! I have a microphone so I'm real loud now.\n:Beret Guy: How does this Mars data compare to data from other fields? Like medicine? Or sports?\n\n:Cueball (offscreen): That question makes no sense.\n:Beret Guy: If there's water on Mars, is it ruined?\n:Beret Guy: Or will it be okay when it dries out?\n:Cueball (offscreen): Any ''other'' questions?\n\n:[The shot zooms out, showing that Cueball and the lectern is standing on a podium and also the crowd comes in to view.]\n:Beret Guy: What were those guys hassling Luke in the Mos Eisley Cantina trying to accomplish? I felt like I was supposed to understand that.\n:Cueball: Anyone ''else?''\n:Ponytail: That's now my question, too.\n:Megan: Were they just picking a fight?\n:Ponytail: If so, why did...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Elon Musk]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Beret Guy's Business]]"
