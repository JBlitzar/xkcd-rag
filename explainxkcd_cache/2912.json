The type of cursive used is closest to {{w|D%27Nealian|D'Nealian}} though a few of the letters appear to be in the {{w|Zaner-Bloser_(teaching_script)|Zaner-Bloser}} style of cursive (specifically the P, Q, and p). The graph uses two criteria: legibility and coolness. According to the graph in the comic: 'L' is in the top-right quadrant indicating it is both cool and easy to read; 'C' is in the top-left, meaning it is easy to read, yet not cool; 'Z' and 'z' are in the bottom-right which means cool looking, yet not easy to read; and 'r' which is bottom-left indicating it is neither particularly cool nor very easy to read (perhaps being confusable as a form of 'n', or even 'M', at least until actual cursive versions of those are comparable against).  \n\nThe purpose of cursive is to allow efficient handwriting and make characters look nice and more \"connected\" at the same time. This is a particular issue when writing with a quill or fountain pen which tends to make noticeable marks when lifting the pen, so joined letters are generally neater than separated ones. The possible downside of this is the legibility of the individual letters. This may be due to the similarity of cursive letter shapes (e.g. 'U' and 'V' or 'e' and 'l' in the graph), especially when joined to other letters, or due their dissimilarity from more familiar \"block letter\" counterparts (e.g. 'Z' and 'z' in the lower right corner).\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] states 'L' and 'q' are letters that he enjoys writing in cursive, which could possibly add a third axis (most fun to least fun) to the graph. Notably, some RSS apps have challenges displaying the font and result in settings of '???'s. \n\nThe title text is written in cursive-looking font using upper unicode characters (encoded as UTF-8). Example: the cursive 'I' character 𝓘 (Unicode [https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1D4D8 120024 U+1D4D8]) is F0 9D 93 98 in UTF-8. \nThe title text includes 22 of 26 characters in the {{w|English alphabet|English lowercase alphabet}} and is thus 4 characters short of a {{w|pangram}} (missing letters: j, v, x and z). Pangrams are often used to show all the characters in a typeface in print or on a computer screen. It is unclear if the comic deliberately chose the words in the title text to show almost all the characters in cursive or if it is simply a coincidence.\n\nTo benefit those with lacking Unicode support, the title text reads: \"''I think capital L is probably the most fun to write, though lowercase q is also a strong contender.''\"\n\n==Table==\n<!-- Extended notes for the benefit of future editors who wish to tweak/correct anything and might need to know the assumptions being made here.\n ... All the following percentages (roughly equal to those stated in prior edits) are taken directly from pixel positions on the _2x image.\n ... The upper/lower and left/right extremes of each character were identified, and the respective midpoints used.\n ... Considered establishing the 'guidelines' of a given font, e.g. 'baseline', normal full riser height,\n ...  mid-height (typical top of small characters and descender-depth (bottom of characters that go beneath)\n ...  but that would take more judgement and still give the problem of where to site 'mid-height'.\n ... Also considered \"mid-height\" for capitals/'full-riser lowercase' but \"top edge\" for squat(+descender) lowercase,\n ...  though did not add the decision-forking necessary to \n ... Widthwise, characters with long leading and trailing 'cursivity' have several potential horizontal midpoints\n ... Also considered taking the 'centre of gravity' of the pixels in the strokes, but even more effort needed there.\n ... Those positions are then related to axes values (looks like 80px per 10% was used, plus or minus drawning-errors).\n ... Percentages rounded to 2%. Identical values at that 'resolution' are provably aligned vert/horiz,\n ...  finer makes no sense, coarser clumps more things together than it need be.\n ... All original positional info is included, 'hidden', in case anyone wants to verify it or do 'better' (e.g. upper/lower bias)\n ... (( Basic forumale in this case: Coolness==(xc-225)/8; Readability==100-((yc-74)/8); With added scaling and rounding as necessary. ))\n ... Therefore full confidence in every position from this edit, but do of course feel free to tweak.\n ... *NOT* completely confident that every letter is correctly identified (e.g. \"T\" looked like a serifed \"I\", to me!)\n ...  but it should be easy enough to redo the Letter column (and reorder its natural position?) if I've erred in that.\n ... Table made fully sortable (not so useful on Notes, of course).\n ... Ok, I leave the rest to any future editors.\n ...  ~~signed~~ an IP editor who just had a bit more time on their hands than may have been good for them. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
