Nc3 ... ↘↘↘ 0-1\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is comparing the opening moves of the game of {{w|chess}} to the opening moves of the {{w|Battle of Agincourt}}, which was fought between the English and the French in the {{w|Hundred Years War}}. In the battle, just like in the comic, the English used their longbowmen effectively, neutralizing the French knights and infantry. The two pieces that are moved out of the white side of the board are both the pieces known as the knights. White moves first in chess, and in the actual battle, the French knights on horseback attacked first; the English being the black pieces may also be a reference to {{w|Edward the Black Prince}}, who was a prominent figure in an earlier stage of the Hundred Years War. As you can see, the {{w|Pawn_(chess)|pawns}} (foot soldiers) on the right side of the chess board have bows.\n\nThe word \"{{w|gambit}}\" means \"an opening in chess, in which a minor piece or a pawn is sacrificed to gain an advantage\". The usual gambit of sacrificing a pawn is subverted to be a sacrifice of a high-value piece, as an analogy of what happened at Agincourt.\n\nThe title text uses {{w|algebraic chess notation}}. Nf3 means a knight has moved to square f3. N means knight because the king piece uses the K abbreviation. What comes after the typical chess move is what can only be read as a hail of arrows. 0-1 at the end means that \"Black Wins\". This implies that White resigned, as he is not in checkmate (for non-timed chess games, the only ways to win are by checkmating your opponent or by having them resign). It seems to be an error that ellipses are included before Black's moves, as algebraic notation uses ellipses only to indicate that White's move has been omitted.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A chessboard, The black pawns have all gained longbows and have specifically taken down the white knights as they move forward, without any black pieces needing to move from their opening positions. Caption below the panel:]\n:The Agincourt Gambit\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the title text, Nf3 was accidentally written as Ne3. At the beginning of a chess game, neither white knight can move to e3. The proper move (and the move actually made, in the picture) is Nf3. This was later corrected.\n\n* There is an actual chess opening known as the Agincourt Defense: 1. c4 e6. However, in the case of the Agincourt Defense, White represents the English and Black the French, which is the opposite of the situation depicted in the comic. This is because the move 1. c4 by White is the English Opening, and the move 1... e6 by Black is the same as what Black plays in the French Defense, which is 1. e4 e6.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Chess]]"
