This is a reference to the idiom \"{{w|turtles all the way down}}\", which refers to the problem of infinite recursion: if everything in the universe is \"on top of\" something else, so to speak, there must be a \"bottom.\" A joking solution to the paradoxical nature of such a bottom is the proposition that the world rests on a semi-infinite stack of turtles.\n\nThe origins of the turtle story are uncertain. It has been recorded since the mid 19th century, and may possibly date to the 18th. One recent version appears in {{W|Stephen Hawking}}'s 1988 book {{W|A Brief History of Time}}, which starts:\n\n{{Quote|A well-known scientist (some say it was {{W|Bertrand Russell}}) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: \"What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.\" The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, \"What is the tortoise standing on?\" \"You're very clever, young man, very clever,\" said the old lady. \"But it's turtles all the way down!\"|{{w|Stephen Hawking}}|1988}}\n\nSeveral {{w|World Turtle|ancient myths}}, dating back thousands of years, involve a turtle which supports the whole world, or a part of it, although it is usually just one turtle, not an infinite regression.  This is also repeated in {{w|Terry Pratchett}}'s {{w|Discworld}} novels, in which the world is supported by four elephants standing on the back of a single turtle called {{w|Great A'Tuin}}.\n\nAs can be read you should '''\"scroll to zoom\"'''. This can be done by placing the cursor inside the panel of the comic. When scrolling up (using the mouse wheel) the picture zooms in on the pixel beneath the cursor. Moving the cursor will also move the point to which the picture zooms. You can then zoom in until the pixels are visible. When you continue to zoom in on a pixel it then resolves into another comic picture, with black-on-white comic panels making up the white pixels and white-on-black panels making up the black pixels. Scrolling on until you can see the pixels of the comic picture you are now zooming into the process is repeated again and will be so for all subsequent sets of comic panels. Not all white and all black panels are the same; some sets involve more than two different panels, but all involve repetitive tiling.\n\nOnce you have zoomed in, you are able to click and drag the picture, thus enabling you to move from black to white picture pixel. This is reminiscent of the earlier [[:Category:Interactive comics|interactive]] comic [[1110: Click and Drag]].\n\n==Themes==\nBelow are all the themes relevant to cover all the images found when zooming in, sorted in the same order as in the gallery: [[1416: Pixels/Images]]. Open the gallery in another window - zoom out and then you can see the pictures in this window as you read about them here below.  You can see thumbnail versions of each picture at the top of the theme sub-section.\n\n===Turtles===\n[[Image:01-100-pixels-turtles.png|link=File:pixels-turtles.png]]\n[[File:02-100-pixels-quiet-turtle.png|link=File:pixels-quiet-turtle.png]]\n[[File:03-100-pixels-i-am-a-turtle.png|link=File:pixels-i-am-a-turtle.png]]\n\nApart from the first image there are two more with a single turtle in them. In one of these the turtle thinks \"I am a turtle\". This is a reference to [[889: Turtles]]. It may say so to the Cueball that is seen standing all alone in another picture.\n\n===What if?===\n[[File:04-100-pixels-blank-figure.png|link=File:pixels-blank-figure.png]]\n[[File:05-100-pixels-whatif-trade.png|link=File:pixels-whatif-trade.png]]\n[[File:06-100-pixels-whatif-king.png|link=File:pixels-whatif-king.png]]\n\nThere is a panel featuring just Cueball, followed by is a picture of the ''What If?'' book, large enough that all of the text is visible on the front cover. But there is also another version where the author's name is crossed out and replaced with {{w|Stephen King}}, the word \"Spooky\" has been added above the title, and the word \"xkcd\" below has been struck and replaced with \"being afraid\" to form the phrase \"creator of being afraid\".  Stephen King is one of the most prolific and well-known horror authors of all time.\n\n===Book Launch===\n[[File:07-100-pixels-book-launch.png|link=File:pixels-book-launch.png]]\n\nThis comic was released on September 3, 2014, the day after [[Randall|Randall's]] book ''[http://whatif.xkcd.com/book/ What If]'' was launched. The book is shown and referred to in a number of frames; for example, it is [[:File:pixels-upgoer.png|'''literally''' launched]] as a part of an <s>rocket</s> [[1133: Up Goer Five|''up goer'']] built by Cueball. There is also a picture with Cueball holding his book, while being excited about the launch.\n\nThe model ''up goer'' is [[:File:pixels-assembly-1.png|made of Rocket Parts from KSP]]. KSP is the {{w|Kerbal Space Program}}, a spaceflight simulator which was also [[1350: Lorenz#Themes|part]] of the latest interactive comic [[1350: Lorenz]]. Perhaps xkcd's \"parts\" refers to KSP's large community of mod developers who contribute 'parts' to the game, although it was likely intended as nothing more than the humorous supposition that one could purchase physical rocket parts from a simulator. The frames showing the book launch use URLs that include the text \"upgoer\" in reference to the [[Up Goer Five]] comic.\n\nIn the end the up goer leaves the Earth after one orbit and then flies through space.\n\n===Needs More Struts===\n[[File:08-100-pixels-assembly-1.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-1.png]]\n[[File:09-100-pixels-assembly-2.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-2.png]]\n[[File:10-100-pixels-assembly-3.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-3.png]]\n[[File:11-100-pixels-assembly-4.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-4.png]]\n[[File:12-100-pixels-assembly-5.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-5.png]]\n[[File:13-100-pixels-assembly-6.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-6.png]]\n[[File:14-100-pixels-assembly-7.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-7.png]]\n[[File:15-100-pixels-assembly-planet.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-planet.png]]\n[[File:16-100-pixels-assembly-planet-1.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-planet-1.png]]\n[[File:17-100-pixels-assembly-planet-3.png|link=File:pixels-assembly-planet-3.png]]\n\n{{w|Strut|Struts}} are structural members in engineering, and are one of the components used in Kerbal Space Program to construct rockets. \"Needs More Struts\" is a meme amongst players of Kerbal Space Program along the lines of \"when in doubt, overengineer\"; it stems from a time when the ragdoll physics in the Unity engine underlying KSP was unstable enough to necessitate their overuse. Megan deems Cueball's rocket to be insufficiently structurally sound, and declares that it \"[[:File:pixels-assembly-4.png|Needs More Struts]]\".\n\nThe first three images depict Cueball building a Kerbal Space Program rocket out of parts from a box, labelled \"KSP Rocket Parts\". The top part of the rocket, usually where the crew module would be located, is made from the ''What If..?'' book. In the fourth panel Megan declares that it needs more struts, and in the next three panels, Cueball takes her advice and adds more struts.\n\nPanel 8 shows the Earth from a distance, with somebody (presumably Megan) saying again \"More Struts\". Panel 9 shows the Earth alone, and panel 10 shows the Earth with the rocket nearby, having just launched.\n\n===The Only Copy===\n[[File:18-100-pixels-upgoer.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer.png]]\n[[File:19-100-pixels-upgoer-2.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-2.png]]\n[[File:20-100-pixels-upgoer-3.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-3.png]]\n[[File:21-100-pixels-upgoer-4.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-4.png]]\n[[File:22-100-pixels-upgoer-5.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-5.png]]\n[[File:23-100-pixels-upgoer-6.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-6.png]]\n[[File:24-100-pixels-upgoer-planet.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-planet.png]]\n[[File:25-100-pixels-launch-planet.png|link=File:pixels-launch-planet.png]]\n[[File:26-100-pixels-upgoer-planet-2.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-planet-2.png]]\n[[File:27-100-pixels-upgoer-planet-3.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-planet-3.png]]\n[[File:28-100-pixels-upgoer-planet-4.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-planet-4.png]]\n[[File:29-100-pixels-upgoer-space.png|link=File:pixels-upgoer-space.png]]\n\nThis series of panels parallels the \"Needs More Struts\" series. The first four panels shows the rocket lifting off, and the subsequent gasses dissipating.\n\nCueball and Megan look up at the ascending rocket, and then turn to each other having just launched the What-If book rocket into space (construction and launch are seen in other panels). Perhaps Megan realizes they may have misunderstood the term \"book launch\", and that they may have just lost ''[[:File:pixels-upgoer-6.png|the only copy]]'' of the book.\n\nPanel 7 shows the Earth from space; panel 8 also shows the Earth, with the words \"Book Launch\".  The next three panels show the rocket circling around the Earth once before heading into deep space, and the last shows the rocket by itself on its journey.\n\n===Space objects===\n[[File:30-100-pixels-sun.png|link=File:pixels-sun.png]]\n[[File:31-100-pixels-moon.png|link=File:pixels-moon.png]]\n[[File:32-100-pixels-saturn.png|link=File:pixels-saturn.png]]\n[[File:33-100-pixels-stars-1.png|link=File:pixels-stars-1.png]]\n[[File:34-100-pixels-stars-2.png|link=File:pixels-stars-2.png]]\n\nHere are five objects in space.  It is possible that the What-If book rocket passes them by, or that these images are seen from the point of view of the rocket.\n\nFirst is the Sun, shown with visible {{w|solar prominence}}s. Next is the Moon, shown in a crescent view with stars behind it. This is followed by Saturn, also in a crescent view with stars behind it.\n\nThere follow two images with just stars.\n\n===Sky===\nThis is a reference to [[428: Starwatching]]:\n[[File:35-100-pixels-sky.png|link=File:pixels-sky.png]]\n[[File:36-100-pixels-sky-2.png|link=File:pixels-sky-2.png]]\n[[File:37-100-pixels-sky-3.png|link=File:pixels-sky-3.png]]\n[[File:38-100-pixels-sky-4.png|link=File:pixels-sky-4.png]]\n\nIn four pictures Cueball and Megan are sitting below the stars. In the second the following conversation takes place:\n:Cueball: Someone once told me the great kings of the past look down on us...\n:Megan: From the stars?\n:Cueball: Just in general.\nThe second panel is a reference to Disney's [http://lionking.wikia.com/wiki/The_Great_Kings_of_the_Past The Lion King]. Early in the film, Mufasa tells Simba that the great kings of the past look down on them from the stars. Later on, Simba recalls this to his companions, Timon and Pumba (who don't take him seriously). In the film, the kings of the past literally look down on — and watch over — the characters, which is how Megan interprets Cueball's initial statement. Cueball's reply that they just look down on us in general shows that he means the kings of the past figuratively look down on us (they view us as inferior or beneath them).\n\nIn the next image a shooting star is seen above them. The final picture is almost identical to the first (only four stars and a few pixels of ground are different).\n\n===Mario===\n[[File:39-100-pixels-mario-entry.png|link=File:pixels-mario-entry.png]]\n[[File:40-100-pixels-mario-sitting-1.png|link=File:pixels-mario-sitting-1.png]]\n[[File:41-100-pixels-mario-sitting-2.png|link=File:pixels-mario-sitting-2.png]]\n[[File:42-100-pixels-mario-sitting-3.png|link=File:pixels-mario-sitting-3.png]]\n[[File:43-100-pixels-mario-sitting-b.png|link=File:pixels-mario-sitting-b.png]]\n[[File:44-100-pixels-mario-n1.png|link=File:pixels-mario-n1.png]]\n[[File:45-100-pixels-mario-n2.png|link=File:pixels-mario-n2.png]]\n[[File:46-100-pixels-mario-n3.png|link=File:pixels-mario-n3.png]]\n\nA series of 8 images are called ''Mario''. The first is called ''entry'', and has a picture of a TV on a low stand. The next four has Megan in front of said TV, holding a video game controller. The cable is connected to something inside the stand. She first kneels, then sits. In the third picture she is lying down. What follows is a picture which is an inverse of the sitting picture.\n\nThe last three images seem to depict a level from one of the {{w|Super Mario Bros.}} games. In the upper right one can see the iconic bricks which Mario can smash, two clouds appear stationary in the background, and a crude depiction of Mario is standing in the lower left. Over the course of the three images, a galaxy rises into the sky. It does not look like the Milky Way would from anywhere on Earth.\n\nThe view is reminiscent of a quote from Carl Sagan: \"...from a planet orbiting a star in a distant globular cluster, a still more glorious dawn awaits. Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise. A morning filled with 400 billion suns. The rising of the milky way.\" The quote was also referenced in [[681: Gravity Wells]]\n\nRandall often allows images of transcendent awe to take over mundane scenes. In this case, the galaxy-rise is a surprising twist revealing the true setting of the Super Mario Brothers games. At the same time it conveys how long Megan has been playing the game - day has turned into night in her room, and also within the game itself. Instead of playing it, she is simply watching the galaxy-rise, as the character on the screen has not moved. The view may contain a hidden pun, by calling to mind {{w|Super Mario Galaxy}}.\n\n===Shut Down the Server===\n[[File:47-100-pixels-server-1.png|link=File:pixels-server-1.png]]\n\nCueball tells an offscreen character that he is going to [[:File:pixels-server-1.png|shut down the server]], while carrying a bucket of water.\n\nUsually shutting down a {{w|Server (computing)|server}} is done via the operating system or software. Directly turning it off or pulling the power plug also would technically work though not recommended for obvious reasons. But in this case it appears that Cueball is going to attempt to shut off the server by dousing it with water. This will likely result in serious water damage to the hardware, thus forcing it off as it no longer is able to function.\n\n===Clouds===\n[[File:48-100-pixels-clouds-1.png|link=File:pixels-clouds-1.png]]\n[[File:49-100-pixels-clouds-2.png|link=File:pixels-clouds-2.png]]\n[[File:50-100-pixels-clouds-3.png|link=File:pixels-clouds-3.png]]\n[[File:51-100-pixels-clouds-4.png|link=File:pixels-clouds-4.png]]\n[[File:52-100-pixels-clouds-5.png|link=File:pixels-clouds-5.png]]\n\nIn five pictures Megan is floating in the clouds. The first shows Megan flying to the right, the second and third show just clouds, the fourth shows Megan flying to the left, and the fifth shows birds flying.\nThis may be related to [[438: Internet Argument]], which features Megan flying in a somewhat similar manner.\n\n===Walking===\n[[File:53-100-pixels-walking.png|link=File:pixels-walking.png]]\n[[File:54-100-pixels-stockholm.png|link=File:pixels-stockholm.png]]\n[[File:55-100-pixels-time-turner.png|link=File:pixels-time-turner.png]]\n[[File:56-100-pixels-walking-b.png|link=File:pixels-walking-b.png]]\n[[File:57-100-pixels-fire-hydrant.png|link=File:pixels-fire-hydrant.png]]\n\nIn two images Cueball and Megan are seen walking. The first is a normal black-on-white close up, and the second an inverted image seen from afar. They are talking while walking; after the first walking image they discuss [[#Stockholm Syndrome|Stockholm syndrome]] and then [[#Time Turners|Time Turners]], and after the second walking image Black Hat discusses a [[#Fire Hydrant|fire hydrant]] with a firefighter.\n\n====Stockholm Syndrome====\n{{w|Stockholm syndrome}} is the name for a psychological phenomenon, in which hostages develop sympathy, empathy and/or positive feelings towards their captors. These feelings are usually seen as irrational, seeing as the hostage is held against their wishes, usually with the threat of physical harm or death.\n\n[[:File:pixels-stockholm.png|This panel]] asks \"How do we know anyone really ''wants'' to live in Stockholm?\", questioning whether everyone who lives in the city of Stockholm is in fact held hostage there and only stays because they have developed to like life there (due to Stockholm Syndrome).\n\n====Time Turners====\nThe time turner is a device from the {{w|Harry Potter}} series of novels by {{w|JK Rowling}}. It allows the user to re-live a period of time over again. In the third novel Hermione is given the time-turner to allow her to take extra classes, however it is eventually used to spare Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution. This prompted many questions regarding why time-turners weren't used on other occasions to save people's lives (among other things).\n\nWhile J.K Rowling has \"[http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner solved the problem to her own satisfaction]\" she admits that she entered into the subject of time-travel too lightly.\n\n[[:File:pixels-time-turner.png|This panel]] jokes that if the real life JK Rowling had a fictional time-turner which worked, she would have gone back and removed the time-turner plotline from the book, saving her all the hassle of dealing with the resulting time-travel questions. This act would result in a time-travel paradox.\n\n====Fire Hydrant====\n[[Black Hat]] is talking to a fireman, with a fire engine on fire in the background, he asks \"To be fair, what else would you expect to come out of a \"[[:File:pixels-fire-hydrant.png|fire hydrant]]\"?\"\n\nBlack Hat appears to have managed to replace the usual water supply to the {{w|fire hydrant}} with actual fire. Thus when the hydrant is used, the result is, quite literally, fire (or oil with possibly flint and steel contraptions to cause fire). In Black Hat's logic, a hydrant which delivers water should be called a water hydrant.\n\nThis completely ignores the meaning of the word \"hydrant\", a pipe which supplies water (derived from the English root ''hydro-'' meaning ''relating to water'', which is in turn from the Greek ''hudōr'' meaning ''water'').\n\nAn alternative explanation is that Black Hat has replaced the water that would normally come out of the fire hydrant with a strong alcoholic beverage, colloquially called {{w|firewater}},  with a high enough ethanol content to burn. If this were the case, the ability to douse a fire would be severely decreased, both due to the flammable component and because ethanol can absorb less heat per volume than water.\n\n===Eeee===\n[[File:58-100-pixels-e1.png|link=File:pixels-e1.png]]\n[[File:59-100-pixels-e2.png|link=File:pixels-e2.png]]\n[[File:60-100-pixels-e3.png|link=File:pixels-e3.png]]\n[[File:61-100-pixels-e4.png|link=File:pixels-e4.png]]\n[[File:62-100-pixels-e5.png|link=File:pixels-e5.png]]\n[[File:63-100-pixels-e6.png|link=File:pixels-e6.png]]\n[[File:64-100-pixels-eb.png|link=File:pixels-eb.png]]\n\nMegan hears a very long stretched ''EEEEEEEEEEEEE'' sound which goes over 6 images. It turns out it is a large letter '''E''' that shouts ''EEEEEEE!!!''. In total there are 64 small E emanating from the big one. There is also a picture with two big white E on black background. Those E are larger than the E that shouts.\n\n===Evolution===\n[[File:65-100-pixels-evolution.png|link=File:pixels-evolution.png]]\n\nThe {{w|March of Progress}} image is a famous and instantly recognisable image showing the stages of human evolution by way of a series of primate figures as if marching in a line. The panel parodies the March of Progress image, with [[:File:pixels-evolution.png|5 ducklings following an adult duck]]. In this case, rather than portraying selected individuals millions of years apart, the March shows evolution in action on a human timescale, the mother taking care of her ducklings. The comic has some resemblance to [[537: Ducklings]].\n\n===Rope===\n[[File:66-100-pixels-rope.png|link=File:pixels-rope.png]]\n\nFour ropes cross diagonally across this black picture. They might be strings.\n\n===Chess and Cantor Set Fractals===\n[[File:67-100-pixels-chess-b.png|link=File:pixels-chess-b.png]]\n[[File:68-100-pixels-chess-w.png|link=File:pixels-chess-w.png]]\n[[File:69-100-pixels-cantor.png|link=File:pixels-cantor.png]]\n\nThere are two chess boards on black and white background with smaller chessboards drawn upon them in a {{w|Fractal}} pattern.\n\n[[:File:pixels-cantor.png|One panel]] contains a number of lines and dots, which are in fact a depiction of the first 5 steps of a {{w|Cantor set|Cantor Ternary Set}}, mirrored about the horizontal centreline (see {{w|File:Cantor set in seven iterations.svg|reference image}}). The Cantor ternary set is constructed by repeatedly deleting the open middle thirds of a set of line segments.  In the comic, the two upper-left most segments and the two lower-right most segments are misaligned slightly.\n\nThe Cantor Set is one of the canonical examples of a fractal, a shape whose individual parts resemble the whole. The use of the Cantor Set in this comic is self-referential, in that the comic, itself, is composed of parts of the same shape as the whole.\n\n===Atom etc===\n[[File:70-100-pixels-particles.png|link=File:pixels-particles.png]]\n[[File:71-100-pixels-atom.png|link=File:pixels-atom.png]]\n[[File:72-100-pixels-string.png|link=File:pixels-string.png]]\n\nThere is a picture of tiny particles, quite spaced out. These probably represent atoms, and given how distant they are, they may well be a gas.\n\nThere follows a picture of a Bohr Model atom with point electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons. The atom is a {{w|Carbon}} atom which is essential for all living matter and therefore for evolution. There is also a picture of what is probably a vibrating cosmic string fragment (a concept in {{w|string theory}}). Despite {{w|Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg}}'s {{w|uncertainty principle}}, zooming down to the string does not mean that the cartoon viewer has reached the \"bottom\" of the comic - zooming in on the loop will show a picture of string.\n\n===Holism, Reductionism, Mu===\n[[File:73-100-pixels-mu.png|link=File:pixels-mu.png]]\n[[File:74-100-pixels-mu-b.png|link=File:pixels-mu-b.png]]\n[[File:75-100-pixels-holism.png|link=File:pixels-holism.png]]\n[[File:76-100-pixels-holism-b.png|link=File:pixels-holism-b.png]]\n[[File:77-100-pixels-reductionism.png|link=File:pixels-reductionism.png]]\n[[File:78-100-pixels-reductionism-b.png|link=File:pixels-reductionism-b.png]]\n\nThese three words refer to \"A MU offering\", an essay by {{w|Douglas Hofstatder}} in his book {{w|Godel, Escher, Bach}} (which was referenced by Randall in [[24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey]]). It includes a similar multiple level drawing: {{w|Mu (negative)|the word MU}} is composed of copies of the words [[:File:pixels-holism.png|HOLISM]] and [[:File:pixels-reductionism.png|REDUCTIONISM]], each of which are in turn made of smaller copies of the other, which are in turn made of [http://newtonexcelbach.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/two-more-letters/ tiny copies] of the word [[:File:pixels-mu.png|MU]].\n\n{{w|Mu (negative)|Mu}} is an important word in {{w|Buddhism}}. Literally, it means \"no\" or \"not\", but in Buddhism it also refers to a state of being or thinking - or rather, of not being and not thinking. It could be said that the pairs of panels in this series are each other's Mu, being negative (white-on-black and black-on-white).\n\n{{w|Holism}} is a philosophical principle that systems should be considered as a complete whole, not as a set of individual parts. For example, a human viewed holistically is a whole interconnected being which can only be fully understood in its own context.\n\n{{w|Reductionism}} is essentially Holism's opposite, a philosophical principle that any complex object can be reduced to a collection of simpler objects. A human can be considered as a set of organs (e.g. the heart), which in turn is composed of tissue (in this case muscle), composed of many cells.  Cells can then be reduced to organelles, such as the nucleus; this contains chromosomes, made of DNA, a molecule made of atoms; atoms are made of components including protons; and protons are composed of quarks (which may be considered as one-dimensional strings). Reductionism holds that a full understanding of the simplest components of a system, and how they interact, can lead to a full understanding of the system as a whole. The word was later reduced in [[1734: Reductionism]].\n\nHolism and reductionism are complementary, rather than competing, philosophies, as both have their strengths and weaknesses. Holism can be very effective in understanding the larger-scale effects of a system by observing macroscopic events and how they are linked, but it ignores the more in-depth understanding gained by considering the smaller-scale components.  Reductionism can in theory give us a complete understanding of the entire system by building it up from the smallest and simplest parts, but for a complex system, this is effectively impossible (a typical human contains roughly 10<sup>29</sup> quarks, whose interactions cannot possibly be computed and understood in human terms or timescales).\n\n\"Pixels\" is an example of a system best understood with a combination of holism and reductionism.  Each panel can be fully explained in its own terms, but is more completely understood as part of a small series of panels. The interconnectedness of all the panels shows a more holistic understanding, yet even this cannot explain comic fully, which must be experienced, with its interactivity and sense of exploration.\n\nThese panels can be found inside panels with Megan.\n\n===du===\n[[File:79-100-pixels-du.png|link=File:pixels-du.png]]\n\n\"[[:File:pixels-du.png|du]]\" is a {{w|POSIX}} (think {{w|Linux}}/{{w|Mac OS X}}) command to indicate the \"disk usage\" of a file or directory.\n\n    ~$ du -s video/\n    4170882256\n\nThis is a command that shows how large all the files are in this user's \"video\" directory - presumably where they store their personal videos. The units of the result is probably kilobytes (depending on settings, could also be the number of 512-byte blocks).\n\nThis number is clearly large and difficult to parse, and the units are not clear (to a bystander). More appropriate units would be gigabytes rather than bytes. The du command offers an option to display units in \"human readable format\", which will adapt to use kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, etc. as appropriate.
