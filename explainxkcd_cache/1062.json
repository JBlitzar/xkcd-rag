Wikipedia has a great definition: \"Deficit hawk is an American political slang term for people who place great emphasis on keeping the federal budget under control. Deficit hawks believe the best way to reduce the deficit, pay off national debt, and balance the budget is by a combination of increasing taxes and cutting government spending.\" It is derived from the concept of a \"hawk\", or \"warhawk\", being a person who advocates aggressive foreign policy, compared with \"doves\" who prefer negotiated diplomacy; a deficit hawk thus tends to promote harsher economic actions to 'defeat' deficits.\n\nAnd obviously, a 'regular' {{w|hawk}} is a bird of prey. In this case, the prey has become a politician known to be fiscally strict. This event may have been contrived, as a certain [[Black Hat]] is visible in the audience.\n\nIn the title text, there is a reference to the {{w|sugar glider}}, which is a small gliding possum originating from the {{w|marsupial}} infraclass or subclass. They are generally considered to be cute and harmless, as well as being relatively obscure, indicating a politician who is humorous and good-natured enough to make such a comparison, as well as nerdy enough to know what a sugar glider is. Having an insect diet, along with the sugary saps that inspire its name, a \"deficit sugar glider\" would not normally be seen as aggressive (by anyone not relating themselves to any sort of insect) as the carnivore-inspired \"hawk\", but would perhaps be considered more proactive than those who might be said to equivalently tend to 'peck' at a deficit's {{w|Columbidae#Feeding|'peppercorn grains' and 'low-hanging fruits'}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The front page of a newspaper with the name of the paper in large gray letters at the top, and several unreadable sections left of, right of, and below the main front page news. A large heading is written to the left of a photo on the right. In the photo a man with black hair who has been standing behind a lectern with a microphone delivering a speech is falling towards the left and holding out one hand in that direction while blocking his face with the other hand against an attack from a large black bird. Below the podium with the lectern is the top of the crowd in the front row. Five Cueball-like guys (two cut off at the edges), a person with black hair and Black Hat to the right can be seen. Below the headline and below the picture are black lines indicating the main text in the article.]\n:Title: <font color=\"gray\"><small>The</small> <big><big>'''Daily News'''</big></big> </font>\n:Headline: '''Deficit Hawk Attacked by Regular One'''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
