The actual first verse and chorus are as follows:\n\n:''You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips''\n:''And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips''\n:''You're trying hard not to show it (baby)''\n:''But baby, baby, I know it:''\n\n:''You've lost that lovin' feelin'''\n:''Ohh, that lovin' feelin'''\n:''You've lost that lovin' feelin',''\n:''Now it's gone, gone, gone, ohh-ohh.''\n\nIn this comic's parody of the song, [[Cueball]] decides that since his relationship with his ''current'' girlfriend is cooling, maybe he should try her sister instead. (And as mentioned in the title text, at least ''she'' will have sex with him.)\n\n[[49: Want]], [[279: Pickup Lines]], and panel 20 of [[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel]] also have jokes centered around the same subject.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips\n\n:Cueball: And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips.\n\n:[Cueball thoughtfully places his hand on his chin.]\n:Cueball: Maybe I should try your sister instead.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Your sister]]"
