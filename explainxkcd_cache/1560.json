This phrase has been quoted and modified often enough that it's often mistakenly attributed to other sources. \n\nFormer wrestler Rowdy {{w|Roddy Piper}}, who played the protagonist in ''They Live'', died five days prior to the publication of this comic so this comic is most likely a [[:Category:Tribute|tribute]] to him. The iconic quote was an ad-lib Piper himself came up with.\n\nIn the comic, [[Beret Guy]] stands in an open doorway with a strong light behind him, a typical pose in action movies when someone is dramatically entering a room. However, in this instance, Beret Guy claims that he is here to \"chew bubble gum and make friends\". He then offers a stick of gum to both [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]], making it clear he intends to do both of his stated objectives. This is expected from Beret Guy, who is usually both na√Øve about the world and beings that surround him, and also friendly to them.\n\nThe title text seems to be a slight dig at the trope of a laconic hero who utters only a few gnomic words, as in the ''They Live'' scene. It is another variation of the line, with meta-humor. The speaker states that he is here to say 18 words and chew bubble gum, but reaches 18 words before he is able to finish his sentence. Thus, readers are left in ambiguity as to whether or not he is also out of bubble gum, as the line could end \"and I'm all out of words\", \"and I'm all out of gum\", or \"and I'm all out of both.\" Of course if it is a tribute to Rowdy it could have been \"and I'm all out of time!\" And his time was up just then before that last word.\n\nStrangely, though, [[Randall]] has not preserved the number of words in the original film quote: there are 16. There would be 18 if 'bubble gum' (which occurs twice) were taken as two words, but in the comic, it is clear that Randall takes it as one.\n\nBeret Guy has previously indicated he has a finite number of words he can say in [[1493: Meeting]]. In [[3009: Number Shortage]], it was indicated that they're running out of numbers.\n\nIn [[1110: Click and Drag]] Megan, walking out on to a platform on the left side of the tower Burj Khalifa, says \"I came here to chew bubblegum... And I'm all out of bubblegum\" to which Cueball walking with her replies \"That's a shame\" (see [http://imgs.xkcd.com/clickdrag/1n2w.png picture here].)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy stands dramatically silhouetted in a doorway.]\n:Beret Guy: I came here to chew bubblegum and make friends!\n\n:[Beret Guy, in normal lighting, looks at Megan and Cueball who stare back.
