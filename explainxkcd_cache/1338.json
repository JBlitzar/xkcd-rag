Only a few centuries ago, {{w|humans}}, their {{w|pets}} and {{w|livestock}} came to make up a great proportion of the earth's land mammal {{w|biomass}}. Note that only land-dwelling mammals are taken into account, so for instance {{w|whales}} and {{w|sea cows}} will not be included. (Whether this only covers animals that cannot live on land or any {{w|marine mammals}} like for instance {{w|Pinniped|seals}} and {{w|walrus}}, is not clear).\n\nThe design of the blocks loosely resembles a {{w|Cell (biology)|cell}}. This could be a reference to how these animals support humans, analogous to a cell supporting a central nucleus. If so, it seems that all the animals in this diagram, {{w|wild animals|wild}} or {{w|Domestication|domestic}}, in some way support human activity.\n\nThe title text states that {{w|bacteria}} outweigh us thousands to one, without counting the several pounds of {{w|Human microbiota|bacteria in our body}} that are considered part of our own weight (like {{w|Gut flora}}). The aforementioned cell could also be a bacterium, making it a possible reference to the title text, since 1256 blocks have been used to sketch the \"cell\", and bacteria outweigh us by about this factor.\n\nThis comic may be a [[Nerd Sniping|nerd snipe]] from [[Randall]], challenging his readers to figure out the missing parts.\n\nRandall also discusses animal biomass in [http://whatif.xkcd.com/123/ Fairy Demographics] in which he compares the biomass of \"fairies\" to humans, horses, and humpback whales.\n\n===Weight===\nAccording to the diagram, there are 358 million tons of humans, 864 million tons of pets and livestock, of which 520 million tons comes from {{w|cattle}}, and 34 million tons of wild animals; for a total of 1.256 billion tons.\nThe number of blocks represents the weight of the group in millions of tons = billions of kg. Note that some entries have the same number of blocks, and thus have the same rank.\n\n====Humans====\nCattle, in aggregate, are much heavier than the human population. Humans outweigh both {{w|sheep}} and {{w|Domestic pig|pigs}} put together. This may be a surprise for people in the countries that produce the majority of meat from such animals, because here these animals outweigh the population. But there are many parts of the world where especially pigs are not eaten, and it is not every where that sheep is in great demand. And especially in the some of the most populations dense regions in the {{w|Third World}} meat is not something you can afford to eat on a regular basis.\n\n====Our pets and livestock====\nThere are 13 distinct blocks of pets and live stock; only the top 5 are labeled - in order of weight they are: Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, {{w|Goats}} and {{w|Horses}}. Cattle, in aggregate, are much heavier than the human population, which has been inserted in the table for comparison:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 95%; table-layout: fixed; line-height:1.25\"\n|-\n!

The elephant is the only type of wild animal to be singled out in the comic. This may possibly be due to elephants being the largest land mammal. And yes, the world's heaviest land animal only takes up one square. Also interesting is that the largest group of wild animals only comes in on the 8th place in the ranking (which is shared between the two tables).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 95%; table-layout: fixed; line-height:1.25\"\n|-\n!

A few other sources have also been used, but were not referenced.\nOn page 186 of Smil's book, there is a bar chart with the following values:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 95%; table-layout: fixed; line-height:1.25\"\n|-\n!

It seems that this table was the source of most of the data in the comic.  Only land dwelling mammals are taken into account. Whales, wild vertebrates, and domesticated vertebrates are not included in the comic.\n\n====Unlabeled Animals====\nThese are guesses about the identity of the unlabeled animals\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 95%; table-layout: fixed; line-height:1.25\"\n|-\n!

The largest group to the left is the only one larger than the humans group in the center. There are 22 groups in total, 1 human group with 358 dark gray block, 13 groups of light gray with a total of 864 blocks and 8 green groups with a total of 34 blocks for a total of 256 blocks. Both the light gray and the green groups are spread out on all sides of the human center group. Only difference is that all the green are on the very outside, whereas some of the smaller light gray groups are close to the core, far from the outside. The five largest groups of light gray blocks are labeled, as well as the smallest group consisting only of a single green block. All the labels has a line pointing to the relevant group and all of them are on the outside of the entire block. Going clockwise from the top left the labels are:]\n:<big><font color=\"gray\">Cattle</font></big>\n:<big><font color=\"gray\">Pigs</font></big>\n:<big><font color=\"gray\">Goats</font></big>\n:<big><font color=\"gray\">Sheep</font></big>\n:<big><font color=\"gray\">Horses</font></big>\n:<big><font color=\"gray\">Elephants</font></big>\n\n:[At the bottom right of the comic is the following gray text with a reference:]\n:<font color=\"gray\">Data from Vaclav Smil's ''The Earth's Biosphere: Evolution, Dynamics, and Change'', plus a few other sources.</font>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
