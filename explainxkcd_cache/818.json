There’s an illness in my family and I’m having a hard time focusing on anything but worrying and trying to take care of health stuff. Everyone is going to be okay, but it’s going to be a difficult four or five months, and I really appreciate your patience and understanding. I’m going to keep putting up comics, but I don’t how much else I’ll be able to work on.|[[Randall Munroe]]|[https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/11/05/submarines/ Source]}}\n\nThis is the first comic about [[Randall]]'s fiancée's (now wife) {{w|Cancer|cancer}}.\n\nIt is self-explanatory, although vague on specifics.\n\nMore details and related comics are on the [[:Category:Cancer]] page.\n\nIn the comic Randall mentions that he might not be able to (or interested in) sticking to the normal schedule. But he did manage to do that anyway. However, this comic was posted on a Friday, and the next week there were the 5 minute comics, and already the week after the next, xkcd was overtaken by guests during the [[:Category:Guest Week|Guest Week]]. Maybe this was his online comic colleagues who gave him a helping hand?\n\nThe title text asks for readers to send him distracting games to play, then was edited to show his appreciation for the number of them sent in.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Randall, depicted as Cueball, is standing beneath all of this text. The last heart is much bigger than the text and comes directly from the Cueball figure.]\n:Randall: Hey, everyone-\n:Randall: As I mentioned on the blag, I'm going through a rough time right now. I'm dealing with a serious family illness and it's become pretty overwhelming.\n:Randall: We're still getting a handle on everything, and I appreciate your patience while we figure it all out.\n:Randall: Thank you to everyone who wrote in with kind wishes and words of support. They've been passed on and meant a lot.\n:Randall: I like drawing, and might find time for it in the coming weeks, but I'm not going to push myself to stick to a schedule.\n:Randall: However, between my stacks of notebooks, scanner, and supportive sysadmin, I should at least have something interesting to share with you in this space each M/W/F.\n:Randall: ♡\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Randall Munroe]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Cancer]]\n[[Category:Sysadmins]]"
