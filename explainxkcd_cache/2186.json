Megan states that dark matter's density in the solar system is 0.3&nbsp;GeV/cm<sup>3</sup>, as claimed, for example, by [https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4033 Bovy and Tremaine (2012) \"On the local dark matter density\" in ''The Astrophysical Journal''.] Cueball does not understand what that means, so Megan explains that it equates to one squirrel's mass of dark matter in the volume of the {{w|Earth}}. In the final two panels, Cueball humorously misinterprets this as implying dark matter is actually one or more squirrels, and thereby provides the mass which causes [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfHu-UJaK0Q squirrels to spin on bird feeders designed to deter them] while birds, with lower mass, do not. This enrages Megan.\n\nThe {{w|gigaelectronvolt}} (GeV) is a unit of energy that can be converted to a mass using {{w|Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence|Einstein's formula}} ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>. It is typically used for subatomic particles, such as {{w|weakly interacting massive particles}} (WIMPs), one of {{w|Dark matter#Composition of dark matter: baryonic vs. nonbaryonic|several contending possibilities}} for the still-open question of the composition of dark matter, and one which Megan's uniform density figure implies constitutes most of it. For example, the mass of a proton is 0.938&nbsp;GeV/''c''<sup>2</sup>. However, it is common to omit the ''c''<sup>2</sup> denominator, representing masses as GeV or MeV. A mass represented as 0.3 GeV is equal to 5.35&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>&minus;25</sup> grams [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.3+(GeV%2Fc%5E2)+in+grams]. Since the {{w|Figure_of_the_Earth#Volume|Earth's volume}} is 1.083&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>27</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> Megan's figures imply that a {{w|squirrel}} has a mass of about 1.3&nbsp;lb (1.083&nbsp;x&nbsp;5.35&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>27&minus;25</sup>&nbsp;g = 580&nbsp;g [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(0.3+(GeV%2Fc%5E2)%2Fcm%5E3)+*+(volume+of+earth)+in+grams]), a typical weight for several species of common squirrels.\n\n[[:Category:Squirrels|Squirrels]] are a recurring topic on xkcd, but are not a serious alternative to WIMPs as a scientific explanation for [[2035: Dark Matter Candidates|the composition of dark matter]]. Since the September 2015 detection by the {{w|LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory}} (LIGO) and subsequent confirmation by the {{w|Virgo interferometer}} of gravitational waves from unexpectedly many merging {{w|black hole|black holes}} substantially more massive than those produced by stellar collapse, {{w|primordial black hole| primordial black holes}} (PBHs) have become a popular alternative explanation to WIMPs (or squirrels), attracting [https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04023 proponents at NASA,] and [http://www.buchaltercosmologyprize.org/#announcements other cosmologists] for [https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10458 several reasons.] But PBHs remain controversial, because if they constituted more than a very small portion of dark matter, [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/720/1/L67 alternative explanations would be almost entirely excluded.] \n\nOther alternative hypotheses for the observations suggesting dark matter, such as theories involving the {{w|Modified Newtonian dynamics|gravitational force varying over different distances}}, often upset cosmologists as much as Megan is shown to be, because they violate the {{w|cosmological principle}} among other issues. Part of this frustration may be due to the fact that even after many decades of careful, tremendously expensive, and often [http://www.allesfoen.de/artinscience/wordpress/?p=236 stunningly beautiful] experiments, none of the many explanations for dark matter or the observations suggesting it have as yet any support from direct empirical observations.\n\nTo help resolve this mystery, the title text imagines using a spinning bird feeder like a {{w|particle accelerator}}, colliding squirrels at relativistic speeds as if they were subatomic particles, to detect dark matter particles like the CERN accelerator discovered the {{w|Higgs boson}}. (Note, however, that accelerating even [https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/ one squirrel] to relativistic velocities would destroy the feeder along with any nearby birds, not to mention the squirrels, and the surrounding city.)\n\n[[2035: Dark Matter Candidates]] lists a spectrum of dark matter candidates by size.  An oracle reveals that dark matter particles mass [[3085: About 20 Pounds]] - pretty chunky for a squirrel.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan walks with Cueball.
