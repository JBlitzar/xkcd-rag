'Hey man, which way to the airpart?'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is the sixth comic in the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby series]]. His \"hobby\" in this one is deliberately mispronouncing words while talking. Hobbies in the ''My Hobby'' series are generally annoying or weird, but with an element of cleverness. Here, [[Cueball]] persists in mispronouncing his words despite the second character's attempt to correct him. Interestingly, when Randall started the xkcd blog in October 2006, 6 weeks after the publication of this comic, he named it \"[[Blag]]\". He has used that name in several other comics, such as [[181: Interblag]] and [[239: Blagofaire]]. Today, if someone visits https://blag.xkcd.com they get redirected to blog.xkcd.com, but the slogan at the top still says \"xkcd - The blag of the webcomic\".\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] explains that he got the idea for this comic from one of his friends; it's unclear whether the friend's mispronunciations are purposeful like those in the comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption at top of panel:]\n:My hobby:\n:Mispronouncing words\n\n:[Cueball and a friend are talking:]\n:Cueball: Yeah, did you see what he said on his wobsite?\n:Friend: ...his what?\n:Cueball: Wobsite.\n:Friend: ...
