[[Ponytail]] is questioning the reliability of [[Megan]]'s experimental results, given that her human subjects appear to be extremely unusual and surprisingly evil.\n\nIn the second panel, she mentions that several people in one study had been arrested for {{w|arson}}. Megan begins to suggest that the arson is a {{w|side effect}} of whatever is being tested before she learns that the arsonists are in the {{w|Treatment and control groups|control group}} â€“ that is, the group that is ''not'' subjected to any kind of treatment. This suggests that Megan's selection process is heavily biased toward arsonists, for some reason. \n\nThe third panel alludes to the {{w|prisoner's dilemma}}, which is a long study example of game theory in which two participants are forced to choose between protecting and betraying the other. Each will be rewarded for betraying the other, but the best outcome for both is achieved if neither of them does. This is often used as an example of a situation where each party narrowly pursuing their self-interest will lead to a sub-optimal outcome. Megan's subjects, however, overwhelmingly choose to betray their partners, before being told of any reward. This suggests that betraying their partners is a goal they'll seek for its own sake. \n\nThe last panel references the {{w|Milgram experiment}}, which was designed to test compliance with authority. In the experiment, subjects were instructed by experimenters to administer electric shocks to a third party. While the shocks were fake, the subjects didn't know this, and the victims were instructed to feign pain and beg for it to stop. The experimenters insisted that the subjects continue administering shocks, and many subjects did so, despite their misgivings, simply because they were ordered to.\n\nPonytail appears to be describing a similar experiment, until she reveals that the actual study had nothing to do with the shocks, and the subjects apparently smuggled in equipment, with the express purpose of administering real electric shocks to (presumably unwilling) people in another room. \n\nIn each of these cases, the subjects seem to have some some very troubling personal and psychological traits. While a given study might include one or two people with such traits, just by chance, it appears that all, or nearly all, of the subjects in Megan's study possess a disturbing level of malice, and a lack of both empathy and fear of consequences. \n\nThe title text refers to safety procedures normally required by {{w|institutional review board}}s, which are centralized groups within universities that ensure that experiments are ethical and safe. The implication is that the IRB, despite their professional and ethical commitment to safe studies, are so appalled by the people in this study that they're no longer concerned with their safety, or that safety measures are irrelevant at this point because they'll be broken anyways. Or, perhaps, the researchers are so strictly obsessed with the safety rules that their actions are causing their test subjects to develop mental illnesses.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail and Megan sit at a desk.]\n:Ponytail: We're concerned that some of your results may be tainted by the fact that your human subjects are ''awful''.\n:Megan: What do you mean?\n\n:[Ponytail picks up a sheet of paper.]\n:Ponytail: Several participants in your drug trial were arrested for arson.\n:Megan: Side effects can be unpredictable.\n:Ponytail: They were in the control group.\n\n:[Zoom in on Ponytail.]\n:Ponytail: In your prisoner's dilemma study, 80% of the participants chose to betray their partners '''''before''''' the experimenter had a chance to tell them about the reward.\n:Megan (off-panel): Definitely troubling.\n\n:[Ponytail shows Megan another sheet of paper.]\n:Ponytail: In one experiment, your subjects repeatedly gave electric shocks to a stranger in another room.\n:Megan: That's a famous psychological-\n:Ponytail: This was a study of moisturizing creams!\n:Megan: Yes, we're not sure how they snuck in all that equipment.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]"
