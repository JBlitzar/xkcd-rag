Like most introverts, social interactions and obligations have worn him out, and different from most after-party regrets, he appears to have \"talked too much.\"\nWhile at the party, he has likely expressed opinions that might be rejected or seen as embarrassing by his social circle or society as a whole, and is now remorseful and embarrassed he said such things. In his shame, he recedes under his bed, but evidently he finds new opinions to feel strongly about, and quickly returns to society.\n\nThe title text presents a suggestion that will likely not go over well, as forcing those at a party to quietly listen to you is a great way to kill the party. It also does not allow others to respond to said opinions before moving on to the next.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball is walking into the panel from the right]\n:Off-screen: How was the party?\n:Cueball: ''Taaalkiiiiiiing''\n:Cueball: Blablablabla\n:Cueball: I talked so much. Too much? ''Probably.''\n:Cueball: My face is tired.\n\n:[Cueball moving to retreat under a bed]\n:Cueball: So many conversations. \n:Cueball: I'm worried that all my opinions are bad. Why did I talk so much?\n:Cueball: Time to hide under my bed and never speak to another human again.\n\n:[The bed is shown, presumably with Cueball under it.]\n\n:Five minutes later...\n:[Cueball crawling out from under the bed]\n:Cueball: I have some new opinions.\n:Off-screen: That didn't take long.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
