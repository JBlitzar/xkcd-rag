The irony is that Cueball resolved the same thing last year, and it is implied it didn't work, but he says it'll be different \"this year.\" The title text is a parody of the saying \"if at first you don't succeed: try, try, try again.\". There have been many other [[:Category:New Year|New Year comic]]. See [[1027: Pickup Artist]] for a comic describing a similar psychological problem.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: I'm scared of being stuckâ€”thinking I'm fixing things about myself but never actually changing.\n:Cueball: My 2013 resolution is to break out of loops. To recognize when I'm not making progress, stop yelling at myself, and try a different approach.\n:Out of panel: Wasn't that also your resolution last year?\n:Cueball: Yeah, but ''this'' year's gonna be different.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:New Year]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
