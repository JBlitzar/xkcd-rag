Signing a petition or expressing interest in a cause can lead to being added to a myriad of mailing lists for similar groups, all looking for support. This comic shows a caricature of the kind of inbox that can result from this. The emails get more and more absurd as the list goes on. For example, the last one combines a request for campaign contributions with the infamous 'Nigerian prince' {{w|advance-fee scam}} emails.\n\n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=5 class=\"wikitable\"\n! E-mail Body !! Explanation\n|-\n|'''Donate now.''' It's crunch time, and we're low on cash. If you chip in just $5 by midnight, we…\n|This is the classic formula for campaign fundraising emails, and may be a real example. It is always \"crunch time\" during a campaign (at least between filing for candidacy and election day), and campaigns are always \"low\" on cash relative to the unlimited funding they would prefer.  The ends of financial reporting periods, often at midnight, are conflated with \"deadlines\" of significant consequence.  Further, the donation requested is less about the actual money - even if $5 each from several thousand voters can add up - but to get a donor to have their money placed on a candidate, making it more likely that donor will vote for the candidate (via encouraging {{w|Sunk cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy|the \"sunk cost\" fallacy}}), or to allow the targeting of future messages based on how engaged the recipient is with the campaign.\n|-\n|'''Donate $35.57 now!''' Our data team has determined that we should ask you for $35.57 to optimize the…\n|A key factor in the success of a fundraising campaign is the amount of the donation that is asked for or suggested. Even if the donor is ultimately free to donate whatever amount they want, the initial 'ask' can have a significant effect on the amount donated, due to the psychological effect of {{w|Anchoring (cognitive bias)|anchoring}}. Increasing the suggested amount may increase the amount of the average donation, but it may also put some people off donating altogether. Finding the sweet spot allows the fundraiser to maximize the income generated.\n\nMost modern bulk mailing platforms allow users send different versions of their emails to recipients at random. Using analytics packages, they can then determine which version of their messages is most effective at eliciting the desired result (such as making a purchase, reading a story, etc.) from recipients, or even from particular segments, and to refine future emails accordingly. Use of these techniques has resulted in fundraisers moving away from traditional 'round' numbers ($10, $25, etc.) to ask for more unusual looking amounts which increase the average amount donated, either by exploiting {{w|Psychological pricing|such effects}} as the \"99 cent\" phenomenon or giving those that ask an appearance of 'knowing what they're talking about' to give the potential donor the impression that they're good with details and wouldn't be overwhelmed by the pressures of being in office.\n\nHowever, it would be unusual to use quite such a precise amount told them, which may actually appear cynical in its attempt to bleed the donor to a maximal amount, and put many off donating altogether. This is rather than at least the pretense to be coming directly from a more optimal and restrained need/capability calculation. The email then compounds this by stating outright that this is what they have done, and entirely sheds any of the veil of it not being calculated ''simply'' to manipulate the recipient (even/especially if it had not been recalculated to differing odd values for each recipient), plus explicitly suggest that someone other than the message author did this so no longer conveys much of any innate confidence and trustworthiness one might have had in the sender themself.\n|-\n|'''Help.''' Our campaign made some mistakes and we need a lot of money ASAP. Any kind, but cash is…\n|This email is honest about the campaign's incompetence, but is not likely to get much sympathy, except perhaps from those already very sympathetic to the candidate. Any campaign reduced to this level has probably already lost. The email appears to be suggesting that they would much prefer that donors send cash, presumably in the mail. This would raise several red flags: it might suggest that the campaign's finances are in such disarray that it cannot process checks, credit cards, etc. in a timely manner, or it might be that they want to keep donations off the books so that they can be diverted elsewhere, or to circumvent electoral spending restrictions. Even if no dishonesty is intended, it would increase the chances that cash could be stolen or otherwise misused more readily than other forms of payment.\n|-\n|'''Washington is broken.''' When I win, I'll look those other senators in the eye and tell them: \"Jobs.\" Then I…\n|This email, apparently from a candidate for the US Senate, takes a common populist approach of repeating particular phrases to imply that they will stand up for the interests of the common people against a system that is rigged against them, without giving any meaningful indication of what they intend to achieve. Not only is the mere statement of \"jobs\", without any kind of explanation of what problems they believe there are, or what they suggest doing about it, entirely unhelpful, they also seem to suggest that, despite them being elected, it would be everybody else's responsibility to solve it.\n|-\n|'''Hopeless.''' It's bad. Really bad. If you don't chip in now, the darkness spreading across the land will…\n|This is a favorite of moral campaigns, on both sides of a debate. Grand statements about evil and corruption taking over the country if the campaign does not get enough support are common, but they are (hopefully!) extremely biased and dramatic.  The wording in this case is also somewhat archaic and melodramatic, making it sound like something from a fantasy novel.\nThis might also refer to [[1391: Darkness]], where everyone forgets about the day and night cycle, and reporters are reporting on the darkness that has spread as far west as Texas.\n|-\n|As the first woman to fly a fighter jet through our state's formerly all-male university, I learned…\n|Candidates often like to portray themselves as trailblazers for a particular community, who have persevered and achieved despite the odds. Normally, one would make a virtue of being the first ''from'' a university to do something, rather than the first to achieve something involving the university itself. Flying a plane through a university is risky, at the very least,{{Citation needed}} and depending on the definition of \"through\", could imply destruction of buildings or the plane itself, which might paint the candidate in an irresponsible light. The implication of \"formerly all-male university\" may be that the university was changed from being all-male in response to this candidate wrecking it with a fighter jet. This may also refer to the viral 2017 Congressional campaign ad of {{w|Amy McGrath}}, the first female Marine to fly an {{w|McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F-18}} in combat.\n|-\n|'''We're broke.''' No paid staff. No ads. And the cafe has told us to stop using their WiFi to send fundraising…\n| This campaign tactic attempts to appeal to the reader's sympathy by describing financial struggles and poverty, but these tactics may instead make the movement look pathetic and poorly-organized, especially because the group is apparently so poor, they can't afford premises of their own to run the campaign from, or an internet connection to continue sending emails to ask for funding.\n|-\n|When Amy decided to run for Congress, I was like \"Huh?\" but I checked Wikipedia, and apparently it's a branch of…\n|The first few words here might suggest the writer is about to explain how, having initially been skeptical, Amy's inspirational message and/or character has won them over to her campaign. This kind of message is used to make a candidate seem relatable and credible. In fact, though, they just didn't know what she was talking about, as they didn't know what Congress was. Since they clearly don't know much about the subject, this would fail to lend the weight it is aiming to.\n\nFurthermore, while a familiar tone could also be part of a communication strategy to make the message seem relatable, this takes it to an extreme that would probably come across as unprofessional and lacking in seriousness.\n|-\n|'''Are you familiar''' with the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch? His work illustrates my opponent's plan for…\n|The works of {{w|Hieronymus Bosch}} are famous for depictions of {{w|Hell}} and {{w|Limbo}} as brutal places of highly imaginative torments, which the sender implies would be similar to the country under their opponent's plan. This mocks the tendency of political campaigns to present an exaggerated view of how bad things would be if their political rivals were elected.\n|-\n|Being a single mom running a small business while going to law school while being deployed to Iraq taught me…\n|Each of these are typical credentials that a candidate might cite in order to imply that they are hardworking and committed. However, it is extremely unlikely that one person would take on all of these responsibilities at the same time, and attempting to do so might suggest that they lack focus and aren't really that committed to any one thing. Also, it would be very difficult for someone to do all of these things simultaneously (e.g. running a small business while deployed in Iraq), so the person might come across as lying in order to impress people.\n|-\n|'''I will lead the fight''' against the big banks, special interests, the Earth's climate, and our children. I…\n|This is another populist message listing off hot button topics. However, after starting out with some typical promises to fight fairly commonly despised things, it then becomes more controversial. It promises to fight the climate, with the peculiar implication that damaging the climate is the goal, and 'our children', which most voters would think would need protecting. This may be suggesting that politicians using these kind of messages are likely to be hiding bad intentions behind their attractive sounding slogans (or they may be just trying and failing to write a populist message without fully understanding it). The fight \"against our children\" may be a reference to a popular {{w|Bushism}}.\n|-\n|'''Wow.''' Have you seen this video of the squirrel obstacle course? Incredible! Anyway, I'm running because I…\n|A typical form of {{w|clickbait}}. (Don't read another table entry until you've followed that link! Reference #10 will shock you). It is not a reference to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg the Mark Rober squirrel obstacle course], a video that was released two years after this comic came out, but it may reference [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWU0bfo-bSY this now-private video].\n|-\n|'''Outrageous.''' Granted, this was a few years ago, but did you hear what President Ford said about…\n|When a politician makes an offensive comment, it's common for the politician's opponents to send out fundraising emails pointing out the politician's offensiveness as a way of generating donations to the fight against them. Political strategists will often keep dossiers of such remarks to be used when needed in campaigning season. More recently, there has been a trend for trawling opponents' social media accounts for controversial comments they may have made several years previously, or even as a youth. Here, the sender's reaction and e-mail fundraising effort appears to be unusually delayed, as it refers to an alleged comment by {{w|Gerald Ford}} (potentially a reference to his infamous gaffe that there was \"no Soviet domination in Eastern Europe\"), whose term as President of the United States ended in 1977 and who died in 2006.\n|-\n|'''Whoops.''' Due to a typo, we spent months running attack ads against Tom Hanks. Now, we need to make up for…\n|The email apologizes for running months of attack ads against American actor {{w|Tom Hanks}}. Hanks is generally a popular and uncontroversial figure with [http://archive.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2008/01/06/nice_guy_tom_hanks/ a reputation] for being [https://www.ranker.com/list/tom-hanks-was-the-best/lisa-waugh nice and likable in person], making him an unusual target for attack ads. This implies that the sender does not even know who their opponent is, and has mistakenly targeted the wrong person, demonstrating some significant ignorance and incompetence.\n|-\n|'''They say we can't win—'''that we're \"underdogs\" with \"no money\" who \"lost the election last week.\" But they don't…\n|In multi-candidacy electoral races, campaigns will often suggest that a rival 'can't win here', sometimes prefaced with an appeal to authority, such as 'Polls show...'. The hope is that some supporters of the candidate being attacked may be persuaded to switch their vote to the candidate whose campaign it is, in an effort to prevent a third, more disliked, candidate from being elected. Here, the approach seems to be a campaign mocking the opposition's statements about themselves, defiantly exhibiting the negative feedback against them before leading into some point to prove the arguments wrong. However, the complaints being mocked seem like serious flaws in the campaign, and indeed, it seems to confess that they ''already lost'', and thus have no purpose for a campaign anymore. Any campaign continuing to email supporters after losing is clearly in deep denial, especially if it thinks the negative press about it is unjustified. \n\nThis may refer to {{w|Roy Moore#U.S. Senate special election campaign|Roy Moore's attempts}} to overturn his loss in the December 2017 election for one of Alabama's US Senate seats, which came about a month before this comic and made national headlines. After the initial election count had him losing, he demanded a recount. That initial count said he had lost by a large enough margin that Alabama law required him to pay up front for a recount, and his campaign did not have enough funds available.\n|-\n|'''Our campaign's only chance''' is to seduce Jennifer ActBlue, heir to the ActBlue fortune. For that, we need a fancy…\n|This e-mail alludes to [https://secure.actblue.com/ ActBlue], a political action committee that provides technology to help Democrat and progressive organizations to campaign and collect donations online. In reality, there is no ActBlue family, nor any \"Jennifer ActBlue\" who is the heir to its fortune; the name ActBlue is a portmanteau from the words \"action\", in a political sense, and the color \"blue\", which is {{w|Red states and blue states|closely associated}} with the Democratic Party in the USA. Even if Jennifer ActBlue was a real heiress, a candidate whose only hope to win revolved around seducing a wealthy woman would be facing serious problems.\n|-\n|'''Doom.''' Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed, like rain on…\n|This is an excerpt from {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's}} poem ''[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lament_for_the_Rohirrim Lament of the Rohirrim,]'' appearing in ''{{w|The Two Towers}}'':<br />\nWhere now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? <br />\nWhere is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing? <br />\nWhere is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing? <br />\nWhere is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing? <br />\nThey have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow; <br />\nThe days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. <br />\nWho shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning, <br />\nOr behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?\n|-\n|'''Warmest greetings.''' I am the crown prince of Nigeria. I am running for Congress because I believe that…\n|The opening line is designed to sound like spam for an {{W | advance-fee scam}}. These scams typically involve impersonating someone rich, often a Nigerian prince, who claims to be in trouble and promises to share a large sum of money if the victim helps him by sending a small fee in advance. However, the second sentence of this email switches to sounding like a political fundraising email instead of an outright scam. This is either to establish a degrading comparison between flagrant scams and fundraising emails, or just to create a bait-and-switch joke. Another possibility is that the email sounds like it is a scam because it is a scam.\nNote that a Nigerian crown prince could probably not run for Congress without renouncing his title. Congressional candidates must be citizens of the United States, and gaining US citizenship requires one to \"renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which [they] have heretofore been a subject or citizen\".[https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8 (citation)] It is unclear how one could renounce allegiance to a state which they expect to rule.  The only way to avoid this requirement would be for the crown prince to be born in the United States (presumably while their parents were travelling in the country), thus potentially making them a natural-born citizen; even in this case, it might be open to question whether a child born to a foreign sovereign could be said to have been born under the jurisdiction of the United States (and thus to have gained United States citizenship at birth).\n|-\n|The establishment doesn't take us seriously. You know who else they didn't take seriously? Hitler. I'll be like him, but a GOOD guy instead of… (title text)\n|A candidate who {{tvtropes|HitlerAteSugar|compares}} himself to {{w|Hitler}}, even when promising to be GOOD instead, will probably not get many votes. The title text does however conform to {{w|Godwin's law}}.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[An e-mail inbox window is displayed.
