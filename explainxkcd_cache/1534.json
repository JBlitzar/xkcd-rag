I feel no social pressure to enjoy it at all!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Hairy]] offers [[Cueball]] some {{w|beer}} from his fridge, and Cueball takes the opportunity to suggest that people should admit that beer tastes bad and stop pretending to like it. Hairy berates Cueball for making such an admission, and Cueball admits defeat, deciding to drink the beer anyway and pretend to like it to play his part in what he perceives to be a mass delusion.\n\nBeer is made by soaking and fermenting grains in water. This process both produces alcohol, and introduces complex profiles of flavor. However, these flavors are often outside of what naturally appeals to people. As a result, many find beer to be an \"acquired taste\", meaning that most people don't enjoy it at first, but come to appreciate it with time and experience. There's a large and thriving subculture of beer enthusiasts who have strong opinions on the relative qualities and appeal of different types of beer and different process for producing it.\n\nCueball appears to see this entire system as something of a mass delusion, in which nobody really ''likes'' beer, but \"pretend\" to like it, out of social expectation, and proposes that everybody simply admit this. When Hairy rejects this suggestion, Cueball passive-aggressively agrees to drop it, while making clear that he's feigning enjoyment out of peer pressure.\n\nThere are two possible interpretations of this comic. One is that Cueball is right and that no one really likes beer, and everyone is just pretending in order to fit in. The other is that Hairy actually likes beer, but Cueball is adamant on this stance and would sarcastically consume alcohol rather then refusing it. In the first interpretation, the comic is a mockery of {{W|drinking culture}} in general, suggesting that people are simply going along with social expectations (which are created by other people going along with the same expectations). In the second interpretation, the comic is a mockery of people who loudly profess their distaste for beer. In support of this point, Hairy is very clear that Cueball shouldn't drink if he doesn't enjoy it, but Cueball drinks anyway, just so he can continue to complain. \n\nThe title text expands on Cueball's perspective, stating ({{w|sarcastic|sarcastically}}) that he feels \"no peer pressure\" to like beer. The pressure to drink beer or other alcoholic drinks is a well-known phenomenon, especially among {{w|Peer pressure#Adolescence|adolescents and young adults}}.\n\nA similar point about the effects of peer pressure and culture on drinking is made in [[915: Connoisseur]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Hairy standing in front of a fridge.]\n:Hairy: What do you drink? Stouts? Lagers?\n:Cueball: Uh, anything's fine.\n\n:[Cueball and Hairy holding beers and Hairy is drinking.]\n:Cueball: ...do you ever think maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?\n\n:[Now Cueball drinks.]\n:Hairy: Man, you are ''no'' fun at all.\n:Cueball: Ok, got it. Not a word.\n:Hairy: Dude, if you don't like it, don't drink it.\n:Cueball: No, no, gotta do my part! Mmmmm!!!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
