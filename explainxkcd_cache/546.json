Cueball has a point: DRM, while meant to fight those who download media through [[Sketchiness|'dungeon sketchy']] maneuvers, [[Steal This Comic|risks locking out legitimate owners]]. In turn, this turns off legitimate buyers from buying the songs, thus hurting artists. Of course, this would be true if the major stores sell music with DRM. [[Megan]], wanting Cueball to make peace and enjoy his goal, makes the following choice quote: 'Close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out', while she shows the {{w|sign of the horns|sign of the horns}}. The problem is that Cueball is arguing for the enjoyment of arguing, not out of any actual belief in what he's arguing about.\n\nThe title text references [[132: Music Knowledge]] while implying that Randall is not really a music fan, since he would only be interested in music that appears in the games that he plays.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at his computer.]\n:Cueball [typing]: ...and that's why music DRM is bad for listeners ''and'' artists!\n:Megan [off-panel]: What are you doing?\n\n:[Megan enters and Cueball turns towards her.]\n:Megan: In case you didn't notice, we ''won'' the music DRM war.  The big stores are DRM free.\n\n:[Zoom in on Megan who holds up a hand doing the sign of the horns.]\n:Megan: So close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out.\n\n:[Back to viewing both as in panel 2.]\n:Cueball: But I don't actually ''like'' music, I just like being self-righteous on the web.\n:Megan: Lucky for you, ''that'' will always be free.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Rhythm Games]]\n[[Category:Guitar Hero]]\n[[Category:DRM]]"
