This comic plays on that, by placing a Polish Sausage (a North American term for {{w|Kielbasa}}) after both halves of the bun instead of between.\n\nThe title text is a pun on the fact that ''Reverse Polish Notation'' is also known as ''Postfix notation''. \"Fixins\" is a Southern US slang for condiments such as mustard, chopped onions, and more. The slang is derived from how you \"fix\" up, or prepare, your food item whenever you have items that can be customized per person after being cooked.\n\nThe news section for this comic says \"''Comic today's you confuses {{w|Reverse Polish notation|here}} click if''\", which is also written in some kind of reverse polish notation and would be \"''If today's comic confuses you, click {{w|Reverse Polish notation|here}}''\" in proper English. The link in \"here\" brings you to the Wikipedia page for Reverse Polish notation.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A sausage with mustard is sitting to the right of an empty bun.]\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Reverse Polish Sausage\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
