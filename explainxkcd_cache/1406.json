As this is supposed to be a Universal Converter Box, many connections exist.\n\nThe humor from this comic comes from the sheer number of [[927: Standards|different standards]] that all claim to be the universal way to connect two devices, in their target market, as well as the progressively ridiculous conversions that this box is capable of doing, for example, converting audio from a 1/8&nbsp;inch / 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack into a variety of fuel suitable for running your car.\n\nA connector is capable of making a connection to another connector only if the connectors are of the same style and the opposite gender (\"male\" connector is plug, \"female\" connector is socket), except for rare \"genderless\" connectors, such as the token ring mentioned above. Gender changers are devices with two connectors of the same gender. The \"circular center pin DC adapter tips\" in the title text are barrel jack power plugs. There are a large number of these style connectors, and many of these devices look the same, leading to frustration.\n\n===Different connectors===\nThe plugs are numbered from top to bottom and incremented for every wire coming directly from the converter box.\n\n====Left side====\n#{{w|VGA connector|VGA}} (Video Graphics Array): This is a video connector (standard is blue) that connects computers and monitors or projectors. It has fifteen pins in a D-shell.\n#{{w|Digital Visual Interface|DVI}} (Digital Visual Interface): This is a video connector (standard is white) that uses a D-shell with flat pins. DVI is only partially compatible with VGA ports, itself being designed as a \"universal\" connection standard via its sub-types of DVI-D (digital-only), DVI-I (digital+analog), and the incredibly-rare DVI-A (analog-only).\n#{{w|HDMI}} (High Definition Multimedia Interface): This is an audio-video connector that supports high-definition video and audio. It is largely backward-compatible with DVI-D but does not support analog connections from DVI-I or DVI-A.\n#{{w|Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt}}: Thunderbolt can transfer both video signals to a monitor, and audio signals to speakers, and send and receive data at the same time, over the same port.\n#{{w|IEEE 1394|Firewire}} (IEEE 1394): A bidirectional data transfer connector, similar to USB, Firewire is used for networking computers, and connecting audio/video equipment to computers.\n#{{w|Component video|Component}} and {{w|RCA connector|RCA}}: Both component video and RCA are ways of transmitting video and audio signals. RCA is the name of the connector type. RCA uses one plug per audio channel (e.g. left and right). RCA (composite) uses one plug for video whereas the component uses three: Y (luma), Pb (Blue - Y), and Pr (Red - Y).\n#{{w|Phone connector (audio)|1/8\" audio/video}} (3.5&nbsp;mm phone connector): Best known as a headphone plug, but also used for other audio equipment and some video equipment.\n#{{w|Parallel port}}: A port that used to be used to connect printers to PCs.\n#{{w|S-Video (analog video standard)|S-video}}: A video with the video signal split in Y (luma) and C (chroma).\n#{{w|In-flight entertainment#History|Airline pneumatic tube audio}}: The seat would contain the loudspeaker, and the headphone connected to this unit with a pneumatic tube to conduct the sound.\n#{{w|PS/2 port|PS/2}}, PS/3 and PS/4: The PS/2 connector was used for mouse and keyboard connections in older computers; USB has superseded it. There are no PS/3 or PS/4 connectors. This is a play on the {{w|PlayStation}} line of video game consoles, which have recently seen their second, third, and fourth generations abbreviated to PS2, PS3, and PS4.\n#{{w|NEMA connector|120V AC}}: This style of plug is used for domestic power outlets in the US, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and some other parts of the Americas. The pin marked \"removable\" is the ground pin. Not every device requires a ground pin, and some older power sockets do not have a hole for it.\n#{{w|Floppy disk|Floppy}}, {{w|Parallel ATA|IDE}}, {{w|Hard disk drive|2.5\"}}, {{w|SCSI connector|SCSI}}: These are {{w|Insulation-displacement connector|IDC connectors}} for connecting to media drives to processors using different numbers of pins, and hence different widths of {{w|Ribbon cable|cable}}. Despite this similarity, real plugs would not work with break-away parts as the pinout has no similarities and the connectors are keyed differently.\n\n====Right side====\n#{{w|USB#Connectors and plugs|USB}}: Also known as USB-A. USBs are used for connecting various devices to computers, each other, and to power supplies and chargers. The USB standard has multiple connectors. Some of the others are below.\n#USB (weird other end): Also known as USB-B.\n#mini-USB/micro USB: Alternate smaller connections for USB communication.\n#macro USB: Does not actually exist; a joke about a larger version of USB.\n#{{w|F connector}}: A type of coaxial plug used for various television signals and cable modems.\n#{{w|Optical fiber connector|Fiber}}: Optical fiber cables are used for various data transmission purposes and are often connected to devices with only a connector on the device, and none on the cable.\n#{{w|Registered jack#RJ11, RJ14, RJ25 wiring|RJ11}}/{{w|Ethernet over twisted pair|Ethernet}}: Ethernet connections, which use a {{w|TIA/EIA-568|TIA/EIA-568 connector}} (often mistakenly called RJ45 because of its visual similarity), are the most common fixed wire connection for computer networking. The RJ11 connector is used for land-line telephones.\n#{{w|Token ring}}: The token ring was a late-80s competitor to Ethernet for fixed-wire network connections. Its connectors were large and boxy but were unique in that they were genderless.\n#{{w|MagSafe}}: Magnetically-attached power connectors used on Apple devices. The original MagSafe (introduced in 2006) was later replaced by MagSafe 2 (introduced in 2012); both come in \"L\" and \"T\" shapes as shown here for MagSafe and MagSafe 2, respectively, but are incompatible. MagSafe 3 did not exist when the comic was released but was introduced in 2021 with a similar shape to MagSafe 2. The MagSafe 3 charger in the comic appears to resemble the Apple Watch charger, interestingly. In October 2020, Apple introduced MagSafe for the iPhone 12 models. While not called \"MagSafe 3\" by Apple, it resembles the round shape shown here. Also, the MagSafe 4 \"connector\" appears to be broken; this is likely a joke about the {{w|MagSafe_(laptop_power_connector)#Defects|poor quality}} of the original MagSafe 1 cables.\n#{{w|Bluetooth#Communication and connection|Bluetooth dongle}}: A USB device that allows the converter to connect via the {{w|Bluetooth}} wireless networking standard to accessories like phones and computers for audio, general purpose file transfer, mouse and keyboard interaction and a wide variety of other uses.\n#{{w|SCART}}: An audio/video connector mostly used in Europe; it replaced other connectors like RCA connecters and transmited video in many formats, but has itself been superseded by Display Port. Like DVI-I, it, too, was intended as a \"universal\" connector standard by bundling multiple parallel connections into one large plug, with the end devices selecting which ones to use based on common availability.\n#{{w|Tin can telephone|String}}: For connecting to a \"tin can telephone\", an analog device for transmitting sound through a physical connection rather than electronically or via radio waves. \n#{{w|Fuel dispenser#Nozzles|Fuel nozzle}}, with a switch to choose between different {{w|octane rating}}s and {{w|diesel fuel}}: Dispensers for fossil fuels used to power internal combustion engines. Presumably, this would be the gasoline/petrol tip [see trivia].\n\n===Trivia===\nFor some interfaces, such as USB, the female side is standard to the device while the male side is standard to the cable. For other interfaces, such as the RS-232 serial port, the conventions vary or there is no convention.\n\nThe \"universal\" connector here doesn't support the proper RS-232, with the closest surrogate available being RJ-11. The other nearest analog would be the parallel port, available in Centronix and D-25-pin connectors.\n\nThe SCSI connectors have been available as the \"internal\" connectors (see the \"break-away\" above) of 2 different widths, Centronix, 2 widths of the mini-D connectors with the easily bendable pins, 3 widths of the more reliable pin-less mini-connectors, and high-speed serial.\n\nNot only is there gender and connector type but there are also different standards on what data/power is connected on each pin of the connector. Building a working connection often involved getting 3 or 4 adapters connected in a sequence to produce the right connector, gender, and pin-out.\n\nBarrel jack power plugs were developed in the 1980s. The \"barrel\" has an inner diameter an outer diameter, and different style pins.\n\nA D-shell is a trapezoidal metal skirt that protects the pins, prevents the connector from being plugged in the wrong way, and makes the physical connection more secure.\n\nA VGA was developed in 1987, and new versions have been developed since then.\n\nDVI can be configured to support multiple modes such as DVI-D (digital only), DVI-A (analog only), or DVI-I (digital and analog).\n\nHDMI has slowly been replacing DVI and VGA ports on newer devices due to the simplicity the smaller footprint and overall dimensions.\n\nThunderbolt is far faster than almost any connector for transferring data. However, the limited adoption by manufacturers, the higher costs of the hardware, and the security concerns inherent to the interface have limited the adoption by consumers.\n\nBecause Firewire is designed to allow {{w|backplane}} access and {{w|direct memory access}} (DMA) to devices, there are additional conversion and security issues with it.\n\nThe phone connector diameter of 1/8\" is only an approximation using {{w|Imperial units}}. The standard actually specifies a size in the {{w|Metric system}} of 3.5&nbsp;mm. The video plug has 3 contacts (Tip, Ring, and Sleeve) and the audio has 4 contacts (Tip, Ring, Ring and Sleeve).\n\nWhile no longer common in homes or offices, parallel connections are still used in some {{w|embedded system}}s.\n\nAirline pneumatic tube audio was used by in-flight entertainment systems manufactured from 1963 until 1979.\n\nNote that while AC adapters are necessaryâ€”and widely availableâ€”to suit sockets in other countries, this \"universal\" converter does not feature any other AC power plugs, but this could be accommodated using adapters.\n\n{{w|Cheater plug}}s exist to connect a NEMA grounding-type plug (three prongs) to a NEMA non-grounding receptacle (two slots), but the use of such an adapter can be hazardous if the grounding tab is not connected to an electrical ground. A safer alternative is to replace the outlet with a {{w|Residual-current device|Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)}} breaker outlet.\n\nThe computer media drive connectors are unlike the motherboard-powering connectors from the Power Supply Unit of a PC, which may involve multiple additional 4, 6, and 8-pin 'breakout' supply cables that have this feature and specially 'keyed' pin-sheaths as well to allow forward/backward compatibility between various versions of PSU and motherboard that could be used (and power-hungry GPUs of various kinds, as well).\n\nNote that some embedded systems such as cash registers actually do use larger USB connectors to include 12V and/or 24V power connections. These are not, however, called \"macro-USB\", and are not as large.\n\nOther countries often use RJ11-ended cables with locally specific adapter-ends, e.g. the BS 6312 in Britain. Broadband microfilters may make use of this difference by splitting a relevant telephone plug standard into the local non-RJ11 style of telephone plug for an \"audio-only\" pass-through socket and an RJ11 for the router/modem to be cabled up to for the abstracted \"data-only\" signal â€” making an adapter for this will be nearly impossible.\n\nThere are two common systems for showing octane numbers on fuel pumps; the numbers shown (87, 91, 93) most closely map to {{w|Octane rating#Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2|Anti-Knock Index}} values which is used for the North American market and many other countries, the other system used in the rest of the world is Research Octane Number. In the AKI system; 87 octane (91 RON) is regular US, 91 octane (95 RON) is regular European, 93 octane (98 RON) is premium European, and in the US both 91 and 93 are considered premium/super depending on the regulations of a particular state. Some states, such as California, forbid the sale of gasoline above 91 octane. Only very rarely could both 91 and 93 be found at the same gas station. The typical line-up is \"regular\" (87), \"plus\" (89), and \"premium\"/\"super\" (depending on the state and the fuel brand, 91, 92 or 93 octane). A standard diesel nozzle (24mm) is slightly larger in diameter than a standard petrol nozzle (21mm) so you cannot tank diesel into a petrol car but if this nozzle has the petrol nozzle diameter you are still able to tank with it into some diesel cars. Some manufacturers such as Volkswagen fit a misfueling guard and fuel filler neck cap or have redesigned the fuel filler to prevent a petrol nozzle from being used in a diesel car.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Universal converter box with wires to connectors:]\n:VGA\n:DVI\n:HDMI\n:Thunderbolt\n:Firewire\n:Component\n:[sharing connectors with Component:]\n:RCA\n:1/8\" Audio\n:1/8\" Video\n:Parallel Port\n:S-Video\n:Airline Pneumatic Tube Audio\n:PS/2/3/4\n:120V AC\n::[pointing to ground pin:]\n::Removable\n:Floppy/IDE/2.5\"/SCSI\n::[pointing to sections in IDC connector:]\n::Break here\n:USB\n:USB (weird other end)\n:Mini-USB\n:Micro USB\n:Macro USB\n:F Connector\n:Fiber\n:RJ11\n:Ethernet\n:Token Ring\n:MagSafe\n:MagSafe 2\n:MagSafe 3\n:MagSafe 4\n:Bluetooth Dongle\n:SCART\n:String (fits most cans)\n:[Fuel nozzle with selector for:]\n:87/91/93/Diesel\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Computers]]"
