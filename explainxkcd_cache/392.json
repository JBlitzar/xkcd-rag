I'm sure it's all very symbolic or something.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\"{{w|Punch Buggy}}\" is a game played by two people with a view of traffic (often, but not here, during a car ride). For each {{w|Volkswagen Beetle}} that passes nearby, the first player to see it is entitled to punch the other player, while calling \"Punch Buggy\" followed by the color of the spotted Beetle. Traditionally the other player is permitted to return the punch, unless the first player also calls \"no punch back.\" \n\nInterestingly, the second punch has a small effect around it, and knocked the other guy to the ground,rather than just lines, implying that that punch was much stronger in retaliation and that the second person is stronger.\n\nMany people will just assume that the game is always being played and punch you out of the blue, giving you no chance to opt out. [[Cueball]], however, finds the idea that he can simply be roped into a game without consent odd, and decides to make the game stakes more desirable than just the right to punch someone, and (seemingly successfully) uses the same principle to secure the right to sleep with the other man's girlfriend.\n\nThe title text is [[Randall]] elaborating on how ridiculous these types of games are, such as the idea that after being punched, one should just accept a \"no punch back\" rule.\n\nIn the UK, a common variant uses a yellow {{w|Mini}} rather than the VW Beetle. Other examples of this type of game are the {{w|Car numberplate game}} and {{w|Padiddle}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two men are sitting.
