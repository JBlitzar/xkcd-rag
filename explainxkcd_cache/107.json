It'd be much worse.\n}}\n==Explanation==\n''{{w|Snakes on a Plane}}'' is a 2006 movie starring {{w|Samuel L. Jackson}}. It features (surprisingly) snakes, on a plane, attacking the passengers. This comic proposes a sequel, taking the idea to the next level, making things infinitely worse: snakes on every plane!\n\nTo have snakes on every plane is much worse than snakes on just one,{{cn}} as many more innocent bystanders would be injured or killed, and the entire aviation industry would be destroyed. Plus it would be difficult, as there were hundreds of snakes in a single plane in the first movie, so finding enough snakes would be a challenge itself. Since the original movie was generally considered to be quite bad, there is an implied double meaning in the suggested poster, that the movie itself would be \"Much Worse Than Last Time.\"\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] credits [[James Zetlen]] with the idea.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A sky full of jumbo jets is shown in movie poster format.]\n:Top of the poster: From the creators of last summer's hit thriller ''Snakes On a Plane'' comes:\n:Superimposed on the sky and planes: Snakes... on EVERY Plane!\n:Much worse than last time.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring James Zetlen]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]"
