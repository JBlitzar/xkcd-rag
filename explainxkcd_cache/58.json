She responds by saying, \"My heart never gave me a choice,\" a seemingly very sentimental, romantic answer. However, after a {{w|Beat_(filmmaking)|beat panel}}, she effectively kills the romance of the moment by adding, \"I wish it had,\" indicating that she would rather not have loved Cueball.\n\n[[Scott]] appears to be a friend of [[Randall Munroe]]. Comics 57 through 59 all have the title text ''[[:Category:Opening dialogue by Scott|Opening dialogue by Scott]]'', forming a sort of informal mini-series inspired by him. They are:\n*[[57: Wait For Me]]\n*[[58: Why Do You Love Me?]]\n*[[59: Graduation]]\nAs there already was a comic released on Monday that week, the first of these three was released on Tuesday, then Wednesday and Friday. This may be related to the fact that this was the first week where the comics were not also released on [[LiveJournal]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are having a conversation. The same scene is shown for all panels.]\n:Cueball: Why do you love me?\n:Megan: I don't know; my heart never gave me a choice.\n\n:Cueball: Aww.\n\n:[Beat panel.]\n\n:Megan: I wish it had.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Opening dialogue by Scott]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Scott]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
