This comes partly from a supposition that girls aren't smart enough to go on the Internet or even use technology, and more directly from the idea that they are afraid of interacting in such a male-dominated subculture, so anyone claiming to be female on the Internet must be a guy pretending to be one for the purposes of active or passive trolling. Thankfully for humanity at large, the meme is now the opposite of true, but still lives on as a joke, albeit not always a pleasant one. For many users, the {{Wiktionary|puerile}} nature of the Internet creates a repulsive force because of exactly what [[Cueball]] is doing. As soon as anyone claims to be a woman online, there will invariably be a slew of \"[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tits-or-gtfo tits or gtfo]\" replies.\n\n[[Randall]] projects this stereotypical Internet douchebaggery onto [[Cueball]], who behaves this way out of {{w|misogyny}} thinly disguised as a joke. This barely-a-joke, found in certain areas of the Internet (especially IRC and 4chan), holds the view that women are only \"good for\" sex and porn. By making such a huge deal out of her being a girl, he directs unwanted sexual attention at any woman who joins.\n\n[[Black Hat]], while usually a destructive force and self-proclaimed [[classhole]], here switches positions with Cueball, standing up for women everywhere. (This makes sense when you consider that Black Hat tends to pursue Randall's thoughts in a more controversial way, see [[86: Digital Rights Management]]). However, he still keeps some of his destructive tendencies and knocks down Cueball's door. He enlists the help of a [[Ponytail]] character named Joanna to [http://banhammer.urbanup.com/1921346 ban] Cueball from the Internet. (More than 9 years later, Joanna is hired to help {{w|Hillary Clinton}} win the {{w|2016 United States presidential election}} in [[1756: I'm With Her]], released the day before that election. She is also shown in the [[1000: 1000 Comics]], where [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/2d/1000_Comics_-_The_second_zero_in_thousand_Left_with_numbers.png she is seen at number 653].)\n\n{{w|IRC}} is the acronym for Internet Relay Chat. It is a protocol that eventually evolved into the {{w|instant messenger}}s, {{w|chat room}}s, and {{w|XMPP|XMPP (formerly Jabber)}} servers around today. With the advent of live-streaming video online, IRC channels are making a come-back as a way for hosts and audiences to communicate with each other in real-time. An {{w|Electromagnetic pulse|EMP}} is an electromagnetic pulse that will disrupt electronics from functioning normally. An EMP is a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Small EMPs will disrupt electricity momentarily, while larger EMPs are capable of burning out circuitry and erasing hard drives.\n\nAt the title text, Cueball tries to defend his misogyny by claiming that one of his IRC chat system acquaintances is a girl, as if to imply that that makes his words no longer misogynist (this is similar to the defense \"I'm not racist! Some of my best friends are black!\").\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat stands in the entrance to a room. The door has been broken down. A surprised Cueball has turned away from his computer to face the remains of the door.]\n:Black Hat: Hi. I'm here about the girl who visited your IRC channel last night looking for Java help.\n:Cueball: What did you do to my door?\n\n:Black Hat: When someone with a feminine username joins your community and you say \"OMG a woman on the Internet\" and 'jokingly' ask for naked pics, you are being an asshole. You are not being ironic. You are not cracking everybody up. You are the number one reason women are so rare on the Internet.\n:Black Hat: At least, the parts of it <u>you</u> frequent.\n\n:[Joanna enters the room, holding some sort of device.]\n:Black Hat: As someone who likes nerdy girls, I do not appreciate this. I'm here to ban you from the Internet. The gal behind me with the EMP cannon is Joanna - she'll be assigned to you for the next year. Try to go online and she'll melt your PC.\n:Cueball: Dude, she's hot. Is she single?\n:Black Hat: Joanna, fire.\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
