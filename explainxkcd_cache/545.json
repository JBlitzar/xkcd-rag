In fact, its slogan is \"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.\" Most articles on the site can be altered by anyone with access to Wikipedia.\n\nWikipedia has set some standards for its operation, which it refers to as the \"{{w|Wikipedia:Five pillars|Five pillars of Wikipedia}}\". One of these pillars is titled \"Wikipedia is written from a {{w|Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view}}.\"\n\n{{w|Pro-life}} and {{w|pro-choice}} refer to two opposing viewpoints in the debate of the moral and legal rights concerning {{w|abortion}}. For many on both sides, it is a very emotional topic.\n\n[[Black Hat]], like the class-hole he is, has decided to prove that you can create an article which fundamentally cannot remain neutral. Since his charitable donation is determined by the word count of the article, any submission to Wikipedia must result in Black Hat's money supporting either pro-life or pro-choice activists. With a reward of one million dollars, it is unlikely that either side would allow an article that would result in the other side winning to remain unedited. The edits need not even overtly change the neutrality of the tone of the article – by simply rewriting 'unbiased' phrases with a differing number of words, the effect of the page is drastically flipped. It is not clear what would happen if there simply wasn't a Wikipedia article written about the event; if he so desired, Black Hat could argue that this means that the nonexistent article in question has zero words, and zero is an even number. Thus, Wikipedians could be violating the site's impartiality rules even by not taking any action at all. There are other ways in which editors could try to circumvent this situation, such as by using incomplete words, but any of those techniques rely on Black Hat not maliciously altering his own interpretation of what constitutes a word in order to suit his own ends—something that he would surely do, what with being a class-hole and all.\n\nThe title of the comic uses an old (read, \"pre-Internet\") meme, possibly of Yiddish origin, known as {{w|shm-reduplication}}. The speaker replaces the initial consonant cluster (have it 0, 1 or even 2+ consonants) with the cluster \"schm\", read /ʃm/, and says the new word after the unadulterated word, as in the title where it is \"N\" that has been replaced. This denotes an active apathy or an intentional disregard of the authority (for it is usually an authority or someone in a similar position) being mocked. In this case, Black Hat is disregarding Wikipedia's neutrality doctrine with his {{w|word count}} dependent donation rule.\n\nThe title text is an imagined statement from a Wikipedia contributor attempting to assert the neutrality of their submission, claiming no word count was performed before posting. However, it is nearly impossible to trust that ''anyone'' editing such an article would not make an attempt to shift the result in their side's favor, since it is impossible to know whether someone performed a word count.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:Trivia: It's possible to create events which Wikipedia cannot cover neutrally\n:[Black Hat is at a press conference in which he is making an announcement in front of a large crowd mainly of Cueballs but also some Megans.]\n:Black Hat: In a week, I will be donating $1,000,000 to a recipient determined by the word count of the Wikipedia article about this event. If it's even, the money goes to pro-choice activists. If it's odd, pro-life.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]"
