(This had been previously mentioned in [[2481: 1991 and 2021]].) It points out that when a laser is pointed at an aircraft, the pilot or anyone else on board can see a glowing line in the color of the laser exactly pinpointing the location of the perpetrator. While the length of the beam itself is invisible in perfectly clear conditions, any particles in the air along their length will be highlighted by the beam, effectively forming a visible line stretching from the laser point to the aircraft. This is especially true in dark conditions, since any reflecting particles will be particularly obvious in such a case. This is related to the old military adage \"tracers work both ways\", meaning that tracer ammunition reveals the origin point of the bullet just as effectively as it reveals its destination.\n\nGiven this, it can be relatively trivial for authorities to identify where the laser beams are coming from, and quickly apprehend anyone committing these crimes. [[Randall]] suggests that some people shine lasers at aircraft seem surprised when they're caught, but points out that such a consequence is nearly inevitable.\n\nThe Durham Constabulary (UK) released a video on Youtube, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqveUbuxTQY Man shines laser pen at police helicopter, quickly regrets it], which shows what a lasering looks like from a police helicopter, and how quickly it is pinpointed and resolved.\n\nThis comic might be a response to the {{w|2024 United States drone sightings}}, during which many people in New Jersey collectively forgot what a plane is and started pointing laser pointers at them.\n\nThe title text parodies this kind of crime by describing a criminal activity which also makes itself particularly obvious, namely illegal fireworks testing, blimp airfield and searchlight depot, the conspicuous activities of all being clearly visible across a wide area. Such depots, airfields and ranges aren't intrinsically illegal in the US, but typically will need some form of official registration; Randall's examples clearly do not obey the appropriate FAA regulations, zoning laws, etc.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In a black panel there is a glowing green laser beam that starts in a green starburst at the lower right part and exits the panel near the upper left corner. Green text is written along the laser line and where the text ends a small green arrow is pointing to the starburst from where the laser light emanates.]\n:<span style=\"color:#32CD32\">Someone is committing a federal crime right here â†’</span>\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I don't know why people who shine lasers at aircraft are surprised when the police catch them, given that the crime consists of drawing a giant glowing arrow in the sky pointing at your location.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe point of this comic has been previously addressed in [[Thing Explainer]].\n:<b>POINT A GREEN LIGHT AT SPACE</b>\n:You can use a green light pointer to point out stars to your friends. When you do this, it looks really cool, like you're holding a stick that's touching a spot on the sky.\n:Be very careful <i>never</i> to point it at sky boats. It's against the law, and the police lock up many people every year for it. And if you try, you'll be easy to find, because of the bright green line pointing to you.\n::<i>-The Sky At Night</i>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]"
