The previous one was [[8: Red Spiders]], and the next one was [[9: Serenity is coming out tomorrow]]. It was among the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen comics]] posted to LiveJournal within 12 minutes on September 30, 2005, on the first day of the xkcd LiveJournal account.\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] makes a true statement, that his statement is not very funny. However, because he invoked {{w|irony}} and thus makes it self-referential, the sentence is now funny! The other guy Cueball, producing a fake laugh, is probably not so sure that it is actually funny. The barren landscape would have occurred regardless of whether someone made the joke, so ironically, the cautionary tale is completely meaningless, although still funny. Self-references would be used again in [[33: Self-reference]] and [[:Category:Self-reference|many more comics]].\n\nThe title text is a reference to the visit of {{w|Spın̈al Tap}} to the grave of {{w|Elvis Presley}}. In addition, the perspective theme also invokes the Total Perspective Vortex in {{w|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}. This is located on the desolate planet Frogstar B, possibly looking not unlike the final image in the comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A panel only with text.
