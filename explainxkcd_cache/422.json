They normally are awkward experiences for nerdy people.\n\nA {{w|LAN party}} is a temporary gathering of people with computers or game consoles, between which they establish a {{w|local area network}} (LAN), primarily for the purpose of playing multiplayer video games. They are normally very informal.\n\n[[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are likely going to prom together, but they stop when they see that there's a LAN party in formal attire, meaning they wouldn't be out of place. The comic title is likely what one or both of them would say in this situation, since the LAN party is probably much more appealing than a formal ball to them.\n\nThe title text indicates that Randall would have loved for such a thing to be possible, so much that he ''very nearly'' would redo high school just to participate.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball wears a bow tie and stands holding hands with Megan, who is wearing a formal-style dress and has a small stylish crown/high-bun on her head and some trailing tresses. On the left of them, there is a sign pointing left, which reads \"PROM\"; on the right, there is a sign pointing right, which reads \"LAN PARTY IN FORMAL ATTIRE\".]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
