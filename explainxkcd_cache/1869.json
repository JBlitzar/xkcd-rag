I was feeling really sick, but then I ate there and felt better!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic shows {{w|customer review}}s from people who purchased a made-up {{w|sports drink}} multi-pack containing twelve 20 oz bottles. The people who gave negative reviews are {{w|Merlin}} (the wizard from the legends of King Arthur) and B. Button (from the short story ''{{w|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button}}'' and its {{w|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|film adaptation}}). Merlin remembers the future; in the {{w|T. H. White}} novel series ''{{w|The Once and Future King}}'', he was born at the wrong end of time and has to live backwards. Benjamin Button was born with the physical appearance of an old man and grows younger as time progresses. In this comic, they apparently perceive time backwards: Merlin was thirsty then he drank the SmartQuench 9000, but he perceived it as drinking and then becoming thirsty. Benjamin Button was {{w|Dehydration|dehydrated}} then drank 3 bottles and got better, but perceived it the other way around.\n\nParticles of {{w|matter}} can have a positive or negative {{w|electric charge}}. Particles have associated {{w|antiparticle}}s with opposite charge. For example {{w|electron}}s are negatively charged particles and their antiparticles are {{w|positron}}s, which are positively charged. Antiparticles can be {{w|Feynman_diagram|interpreted}} as if they were the associated particle moving the opposite direction in time. Applying that interpretation to customer reviews gives the caption of the comic: positive reviews from people traveling backward in time are negative reviews (the \"antiparticles\" of positive reviews).\n\nThe caption says that negative reviews are only positive experiences, but backwards through life. However, Randall also gives an example in the title text of an ostensibly positive review which is actually about a negative experience by a person traveling backward in time (the person ate at a restaurant then got sick). The conclusion is that even the “normal” negative reviews are from backwards versions of positive events, despite the negative version being more common in our world.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A picture with four small bottles and a larger one is shown.

See [[1240: Quantum Mechanics]] and [[1475: Technically]].\n*There are many examples of [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinSickness \"Merlin Sickness\"] in fiction. Merlin was mentioned earlier in [[270: Merlin]].\n*Time-reversed aging is also explored in [[560: Lithium Batteries]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n<!-- Include any categories below this line. -->\n\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Online reviews]]"
