The title 1337 is \"L-eet,\" or \"elite,\" using the {{w|Leet}} alphabet, a coding system used primarily on the internet (and on early text messaging systems), meant to provide a bit of {{w|obfuscation}} to plain text both to make it harder to read and to show off in a creative way using in-group jargon.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. These are all the comics in [[:Category:1337|1337 series]]:\n* [[341: 1337: Part 1]]\n* [[342: 1337: Part 2]]\n* [[343: 1337: Part 3]]\n* [[344: 1337: Part 4]]\n* [[345: 1337: Part 5]]\n\n\"Like a ring in a bell\" appears to be a reference to the {{w|Chuck Berry}} song {{w|Johnny B. Goode}}, in which Berry describes a young boy (like himself) who becomes a guitar-playing prodigy. The original lyric was \"just like a-ringing a bell.\" Apparently, [[Elaine Roberts]] learned to program as quickly, easily, and skillfully as Johnny (and Chuck) learned to play rock 'n' roll.\n[[Donald Knuth]] is a computer science Professor Emeritus at {{w|Stanford University}} who is famous for writing {{w|The Art of Computer Programming}} and developing the <span class=\"texhtml\"><span style=\"font-family:cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, Times, serif;\">T<span style=\"text-transform:uppercase; vertical-align:-0.5ex; margin-left:-0.1667em; margin-right:-0.125em;\">e</span>X</span></span> computerized typesetting system. He may not have a mountain hideaway (a reference to ''{{w|Kill Bill}}'', by the way, as is the whole training sequence), but he would be one of the best mentors a budding hacker could have.\n\nThe {{w|A* search algorithm}} and {{w|Dijkstra's algorithm}} are {{w|Graph traversal|graph search}} {{w|algorithm}}s. And what study of algorithms would be complete without a healthy study about finding complexities? {{w|Computational complexity theory|Time complexity}} is the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute. Upper bounds for complexity is written in {{w|Big O notation}}. Best possible execution of an algorithm is constant time, or O(1), said in words, for any given data set, no matter how large, the algorithm will always return the answer at the same time. However, constant time is extremely difficult to achieve; linear time (O(n)) is also very good. For more complex algorithms, [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x*log%28x%29 O( n*log(n) )] is good, but [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x*log%28log%28x%29%29 O( n*log(log(n)) )] is better. (Note that logarithms in different bases are proportional to each other. So, this would hold true for any base >1.)\n\nKnowing that [[Mrs. Roberts]] has two children, this daughter named Elaine and the son named Bobby, is the key indicator that this is the mother previously noted as having given her children particularly strange names. Of course, the title text here explains that Elaine is only her middle name (assuming canonicity of title-text), but it was in the title text to [[327: Exploits of a Mom]] that we learned that her first name is \"Help I'm trapped in a driver's license factory\". Mrs. Roberts appears to have had fun naming her children.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball standing and looking down at his Cueball-like friend, who is sitting on the floor near an armchair holding a cloth to his face.]\n:Friend: So the greatest hacker of our era is a cookie-baking mom?\n:Cueball: Second-greatest.\n:Friend: Oh?\n\n:[The next panel is only half height as Cueball's narration is written as a caption above the panel without a frame around it. In the panel to the left lies a young Elaine with a ponytail on the floor typing at a keyboard while looking at a screen connected to a computer behind it with lots of wires and open case. The computer appears to have been pieced together and there is a screwdriver lying next to her and an open box lies behind her. Little Bobby Tables (a kid version of Cueball) is painting with a broad brush at an easel to the left. There is a clear drawing with two parts going up and one down, but it's not easy to see what it should look like. He is holding his other hand up in the air, like he is enjoying the painting.]\n:Cueball (narrating): Mrs. Roberts had two children. Her son, Bobby, was never much for computers, but her daughter Elaine took to them like a ring in a bell.\n\n:[The front of a car is in frame with side mirror and steering wheel visible. Mrs. Roberts is waving goodbye to her daughter who is wearing a backpack and is holding a walking stick. She is about to begin climbing a staircase built into a rocky mountain side. The first 11 step are visible. Behind the two and the stair are two distant mountain peaks, and above them two clouds. Cueball continues to narrate, this time inside the panel:]\n:Cueball (narrating): When Elaine turned 11, her mother sent her to train under Donald Knuth in his mountain hideaway.\n\n:[Donald Knuth, drawn with hair only around his neck, is standing with a pointing stick at a chalk board with graph traversal patterns on it and two blocks of unreadable text the top may be a matrix. This small panel is also lower than the next panel, with Cueball's narration above:]\n:Cueball (narrating): For four years she studied algorithms.\n:Donald Knuth: Childâ€”\n\n:[Donald Knuth whips around from the board slashing the stick like a sword. Elaine jumps, making a somersault (indicated with a line curving on it self from floor to sword) and lands on the stick balancing with her arms out.]\n:Donald Knuth: Why is A* search wrong in this situation?\n:Stick: ''swish''\n:Elaine: Memory usage!\n:Donald Knuth: What would <u>you</u> use?\n:Elaine: Dijkstra's algorithm!\n\n:[Donald Knuth and Elaine are outside, seen from behind while they are both writing on a chalkboard with a thick line down the middle to separate their work. On both sides their writing can be seen but it is unreadable. Where there is only text visible on Donald Knuth's side there is also what appears to be a drawing or matrix at the top of Elaine's. But a similar thing could be behind Donald Knuth's head. Elaine is no longer wearing her hair in a ponytail but have long straight white hair like her mom, Mrs. Roberts. To the left there is a stump from a tree, some grass and maybe a puddle of water. Further back there is a small jagged hill and a flat horizon. To the right there are four mountain peaks and a flat high plateau towards the horizon. The frame of the panel does not include the top-left and bottom-right corners, but cuts round a rectangular section of both places. In these two sections, outside the panel, are the last two paragraphs of Cueball's narrating:]\n:Cueball (narrating): Until one day she bested her master\n:Donald Knuth: So our lower bound here is O(n log n)\n:Elaine: Nope. Got it in O(n log (log n))\n:Cueball (narrating): And left.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOS0sV2a24#t=21m30s this Google speech], [[Donald Knuth]] personally asked [[Randall]] what his ''n*log(log(n))'' algorithm for searching was, and Randall referred him to Elaine.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:1337|02]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|1337]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Elaine Roberts]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Little Bobby Tables]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Mrs. Roberts]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Donald Knuth]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]] <!-- first panel -->\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
