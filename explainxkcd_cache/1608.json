This is not shown in the comic. See trivia-->\n}}\n\n{{TOC}}To experience the interactivity of the game, visit the {{xkcd|1608|original comic}}!\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is an [[:Category:Interactive comics|interactive comic]] made to celebrate the release of [[Randall]]'s new book, ''[[Thing Explainer]]'', which was released on the same day as this comic. It is a platforming minigame, whose ostensible goal is collecting gold coins. This [[:Category:Interactive comics|interactive comic]] appeared on the same date as the release of [[Randall]]'s book, ''[[Thing Explainer]]''. \n\nThe title refers to the skateboard-like {{w|hoverboard}} that was [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ZdMOMUgXE prominently featured] in the movie {{w|Back to the Future Part II}}. The BTTF movies' hero, {{w|Marty McFly}}, travels to the future in this sequel, to [https://www.facebook.com/October212015BTTF 2015-10-21], to be exact. This comic was released on 2015-11-24, about a month later. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33785285 had actually] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HI137m7XA4 come] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLwNGBB_Yb0 to] [https://www.wired.com/2016/03/hendo-2-hoverboard/ pass] by this date, along with inventions like [https://www.terrafugia.com/ flying] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-1pXbW5wVg cars] and [https://www.soundandvision.com/content/wear-your-music-thinkgeeks-soundtrack-shirt#jo8J1DassbWxlptj.97 musical clothing]. Randall is known to have had [[:Category:Electric skateboard|electric skateboards]], which which are thematically related, and another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in [[1623: 2016 Conversation Guide]].\n\nApart from the date of release and the text about the book, there are several scenes in the game that could be seen as [[#Reference to Thing Explainer|references to ''Thing Explainer'']]. Instead, the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.\n\n{{spoiler|The best way to enjoy this comic is to {{xkcd|1608|play the game}}! If you didn't do that already, reading anything below will spoil you from truly enjoying the comic.}}\n\n===Game features===\nYour player in the game is an {{w|animated}} [[Cueball]] riding a hoverboard that assumes [[#Animation|several different positions]] as it travels. You control your player with the left, up and right arrows, as noted on the start screen. Your player can jump repeatedly and thereby reach ever-increasing heights. You can move him left and right both while jumping and descending. (More under [[#Functionality|Functionality]] and Controls.)\n\nYour player begins in a maze (called the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a9/All_play_area_hanging_all_coins.PNG Play Area]). It holds 17 gold coins and contains a \"deposit\" box. One goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible and deposit them quickly. Deposits returns [[#Coins|text messages]] describing the result of the round of play. It may seem to some, at this point, that there is nothing more to the game.\n\nHowever, just out of view, beyond the maze on either side are [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/8b/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Coins_Hoverboard_and_View.png tall walls seemingly designed to contain the player]. But  these walls can be scaled by continuous jumping, allowing the player to exit the maze on both sides, despite the flashing red false warning [[#Coins|error message]]: \"'''[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/Return_to_the_play_area.PNG Return to the Play Area]'''\".\n\nIf you disregard this, you can take your player, hoverboard Cueball, to explore far beyond the walls to left and right (and above), where there are many points of interest to be found, as well as 152 more [[#Coins|coins]] to collect, 116 on the right and 36 on the left.\n\nAll of the interesting places of the game are noted in the references and maps below and on the Extra Hoverboard Pages that are linked there. As a practical matter, however, you can only visit many of the most interesting places only with the help of the JavaScript Goggles hack. Entering Goggles Mode brings up a new pane to the right of the comic that enables you to see secret entrances in otherwise solid surfaces, and to see in the dark after the player enters black spaces.\n\nTo open the JavaScript Console, press F12 on PCs, and Command-Option-i on Mac. In the command line under the Console tab, enter: ze.goggles ( ) , making sure your command includes spaces before, between and after the two parens. This will bring up a window to the right of the comic showing black objects that are right next to the player in red. The red marks the spots where the player can pass objects that are black in the game. Cyan lines in the window mark the limits of how far the player can pass in the dark.\n\nHoverboard's many {{w|Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs}} recall comic [[1110: Click and Drag]]. Nonetheless, Hoverboard is xkcd's first actual game, one in which you move an object in front of the drawing. In Click and Drag you only move the drawing into the view section. In the two previous [[April Fools' Day comics]], [[1350: Lorenz]] and [[1506: xkcloud]], the user does not move anything, but only supplies choices, text and drawings. The next {{w|April Fools' Day}} comic contains another game, [[1663: Garden]], in which you also moved objects around and make them disappear (as you do with coins in this game.)\n\n===Main themes===\nThere are many themes and references throughout the game, but the two main ones are '''{{w|Star Wars}}''' and '''{{w|The Lord of the Rings}}'''. Below is a [[#Details and references|list of details and references]] to these movies (19 to SW and 6 to LOTR) as well as much more.\n\nThe largest part of the game is located on the '''right side''' of the play area and is dominated by references to ''Star Wars'', notably a recreation of [https://youtu.be/yHfLyMAHrQE?t=112 the opening scene] in the {{w|Star Wars (film)|first film}}, where {{w|Princess Leia|Princess Leia's}} space ship ''{{w|Tantive IV}}'', also known as ''[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/82/1608_1015x1078y_Entire_Rebel_Blockade_Runner_zoom_out.png The Rebel Blockade Runner]'', is flying over [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/33/1608_1015x1073y_Ponytail_in_the_dunes_zoom_out.png the desert] planet {{w|Tatooine}}. Here it is followed by the {{w|Star Destroyer}}, ''[https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Devastator Devastator]''. The [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/04/1608_1015x1078y_Entire_Rebbel_Blockade_Runner_zoom_out_to_torpedoes_and_ground.png desert ground with these two space ships] above is the first you find to the right. Although in the game they are located inside the atmosphere, not as in the movie out in space, a fact that is [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1d/1608_1049x1090y_Atmosphere_worry_and_car_room_at_bottom_of_hull.png commented on] by [[Megan]] who looks out from an opening in the bottom of the Destroyer's hull. \n:Megan: Is this ship designed to fly in the atmosphere like this? \n\nBoth ships are high above the ground, but there are three [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/76/1608_1014x1076y_Entire_wires_from_ground_to_Runner.png wires from the ground] that connect (and thus guide you) up to ''The Runner'' and from there [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/87/1608_1023x1085y_Entire_torpedoes_rain_from_Runner_to_Destroyer.png 100+ torpedoes], which are fired [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f1/1608_1018x1079y_Top_rear_end_of_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png down on the Runner] coming [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5f/1608_1034x1091y_Torpedo_canon_below_Destroyer.png from the Destroyer] above, gives away the location of the Destroyer itself. The Destroyer is so high up in the air, that you would not be likely to find it by chance without these leads (or at least some of the several other hints from people on the ground [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f2/1608_1010x1073y_Cliff_with_rock_and_cactus.png looking up and reacting] or like [[White Hat]] looking from the tip of the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/21/1608_0995x1079y_Entire_Washington_monument_extra_zoom_out.png Washington Monument] and reacting [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6f/1608_0995x1083y_Tip_of_Washington_monument.png by saying]: \"Uh, what the heck is ''that?!''.\"). There is also a giant island floating very high above the flagpost in the left side of the world, with no indication of its existence.\n\nOne of the main points (The Joke) of the entire game is the extreme size of [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/cd/1608_Entire_Star_Destroyer.png such a Destroyer]. It takes up more space than the rest of the game (and most of the coins are located there). Inside the Destroyer there are many, many rooms, long corridors and deep shafts, even a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/58/1608_Entire_Cave.png huge cave] with trees and animals. At [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c7/1608_Vader_twice_and_emperor_on_and_near_bridge.png the bridge] we meet both {{w|Darth Vader}} and the Emperor himself, {{w|Palpatine}}. There are many other jokes related both to Star Wars and other movies and xkcd comics inside the Destroyer. For instance, Darth Vader discusses {{w|Steven Universe}}, bringing up Rose Quartz and Steven himself ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/39/1608_1031x1095y_Steven_Universe_family_and_ice_cream_prediction.png who can be found with the Crystal Gems] in a different part of the Destroyer).\n:Darth Vader: But Steven's ''mother'' is a Crystal Gem...\nThere are also interesting things and references along the ground beneath the Destroyer, some of these are also Star Wars related like [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c9/1608_1038x1073y_Wedding_and_picnic.png the wedding scene] where {{w|Jabba the Hutt}} is mentioned. \n\nTo the '''left side''' is an entirely different world, although much smaller (shorter) than the one to the right. Here, the main theme is ''The Lord of the Rings'' mainly with the presence of a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6a/Entire_Volcano_zoom_out.png volcano] where for instance [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/77/1608_0952x1087y_Ring_of_power_and_lave_floor_at_the_right_crater_top.png Megan tries to throw] in {{w|One Ring|''rings'' of power}}, as in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpF3SUFaDw the scene] from the {{w|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|last LOTR film}} where {{w|Frodo Baggins|Frodo}} fails and {{w|Gollum}} attacks inside the volcano {{w|Mount Doom}}, thus making it clear that the volcano in the xkcd game represents Mt. Doom. Frodo, {{w|Sauron}}, and {{w|Gandalf}} are all mentioned in the game. The first two by name in the text. Two {{w|Eagle (Middle-earth)|great eagles}} are [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/cb/1608_0956x1088y_Eagles_over_right_crater_top.png talking about Frodo] and {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien}}, Sauron's name is [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/66/1608_0964x1078y_Megan_reading_for_children_about_Saurons_ring.png read up by Megan from a book], and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a5/1608_0944x1083y_Rock_with_Gandalf_in_Lava_lake.png Gandalf is drawn as a wizard figure] in the crater and also his name is used in the [[#Coins|message]] you receive if you collect [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f7/169_coins_fastest_way.PNG all possible coins].  \n\nThe two worlds do conflict though, as an {{w|X-wing fighter}} is [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/44/1608_0982x1077y_Gas_station_with_x-wing.png parked at a gas station] to the left in LOTR world, and Gandalf's famous quote ''You shall not pass!'' from his fight against the {{w|Balrog}} is modified by [[Cueball]] who is [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ad/1608_1026x1093y_Shall_not_not_pass_room_and_parachutes_at_one_of_two_ledges_at_bottom_of_hull.png ''not'' trying to block your path] to a coin inside a room in the Destroyer. This conflict could very well be a reference to the fact that {{w|Andy Serkis}} who played {{w|Gollum}} in LOTR, now plays the {{w|Supreme Leader Snoke}} in the new Star Wars movie, and [https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/6/64/Supremeleader.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20151223201852 his appearance] as Snoke is not that much different from Gollum's. Snoke also delivers a line in the movie (about \"bringing someone to me\") that reminds one of Gollum when he talks about \"the ring coming to me\". Randall would not have known this last part at the time that this comic was released, but he would likely be aware of Andy Serkis' involvement.\n\nOther themes are related to other movies, like a [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/star-trek-fans-rivalry-george-lucas-roddenberry/ naughty reference] to {{w|Star Trek}} from inside [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png the bridge] of the Rebel Blockade Runner where a long-haired woman (maybe [[Danish]] since she obviously does this to annoy Star Wars fans and [[Hairbun]] behind her, which could represent Princess Leia with her [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Princess_Leia%27s_characteristic_hairstyle.jpg special hair style]) delivers the following line taken from the Star Trek universe: \n:Long haired woman: Captain's log, stardate November 24th, 2015...\n:Hairbun: ''Augh!'' No!\n\nAlso references to video games are seen, best shown with the maze towards the back end of the Destroyer which are an almost [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e2/1608_Comparing_Prince_of_Persia_maze_with_real_level_1.png complete depiction] of ''[https://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/a/a2/Princeofpersia_dos_level1.png Level 1]'' of the computer game ''{{w|Prince of Persia}}'' down to the three coins being in the place of three items to take in that game, and at least two of the opposing sword fighters in the correct places as well. \n\nThe comic/game and book were released only 3 weeks before the 7th Star Wars movie ''{{w|Star Wars: The Force Awakens}}'' was released on December 14, 2015. And this movie had already been referenced by Randall 7½ weeks earlier in [[1585: Similarities]], when another movie ({{w|The Martian (film)|The Martian}}) were released. It was a reference in the title text to the new robot ''BB-8'' that are featured in the Force Awakens. That the Star Wars section is thus so much larger than the LOTR section could be a hint to the fact that it is now 12 years ago that the last of those films were released, and although {{w|the Hobbit}} has been released as {{w|The Hobbit (film series)|three films}} over the previous three Christmases it was Star Wars that dominated the Christmas a month after this comic's release.\n\n===Extra Hoverboard pages===\nSince this comic is so big and complicated extra pages have been created to include much more information than is wished for on this main page (which is already of considerable size). These pages are listed here for convenience, but they are also listed in the relevant sections below:\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/Transcript]]''' - The full transcript of the entire comic, as if you played the game can be found here. It is linked from the [[#Transcript|Transcript]] section.\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/The whole image]]''' - A collection of different compilations of the whole Image. It is linked from the [[#Environment|Environment]] section.\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/Images of secret passages]]''' - Images with an overview of the secret passages in the game. It is linked from the [[#Secret passages and hidden places|Secret passages and hidden places]] section.\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/All image links]]''' It is linked from the [[#All images|All images]] section.\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/Images coins]]''' It is linked from the [[#Coins|Coins]] section.\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/Screen-shots]]''' It can be linked from several sections, but among others from the [[#Coins|Coins]] section.\n\n*'''[[1608: Hoverboard/Images of individual scenes]]''' It will be linked from the [[#Details and references|list of details and references]], which will be using these images in the explanation.\n\n===Characters===\nAlmost all main [[:Category:Characters|characters]] in the xkcd gallery are used more than once, especially there are three characters that are used several times. Number one is of course [[Cueball]] (with close to 90 appearances) who is already shown at the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6c/1608_1000x1074y_The_Play_Area.png starting point]. He is also the first character seen when walking both [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c0/1608_1004x1074y_Cueball_outside_play_area.png right] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/dc/1608_0994x1074y_Base_of_Washington_monument.png left] (where he speaks the first line to the left).\n\nThen follows [[Megan]] with at least 40 appearances, she is even shown twice in the same location three times, one of these three even occurs within one of the [https://xkcd.com/1608/1090:-1088+s.png small images]. She is also shown with Cueball in his first appearance to the left, and she is the first to speak a line to the right [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f2/1608_1010x1073y_Cliff_with_rock_and_cactus.png here]. \n\nAlso [[Ponytail]] is well represented with 26 appearances (for instance [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/2d/1608_0947x1073y_Antenna_cave_in_lair.png here)]. \n\n[[Hairy]] (with different hair styles) is used 7 times (for instance [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/54/1608_Actual_Bridge_with_Vader_and_Tarkin.png here]) and [[Hairbun]] is used 5 times (for instance [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e4/1608_1054x1099y_Corridor_peristalsis_and_two_coin_rooms_at_top_of_hull.png here)]. \n\nTwo of the main characters are used twice: [[Beret Guy]] ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/4f/1608_0990x1074y_If_loving_you_is_wrong_I_dont_want_to.png here] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/21/1608_1020x1083y_Torpedoes_two_steps_above_Runner_with_Beret_Guy.png here]) and [[White Hat]] ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6f/1608_0995x1083y_Tip_of_Washington_monument.png here] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d9/1608_1093x1074y_White_Hat_hiding_in_the_grass.png here]).\n\nThe only exception is that the main villain of xkcd [[Black Hat]] who is very hard to find. He is only [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/68/1608_1069x1093y_Deer_and_exit_below_lamp_coin_and_Black_Hat_in_the_bottom_right_side_of_the_cave.png shown once] in the comic where he very uncharacteristically just sits and snores at the right wall in the cave inside the Destroyer (is it really him...?). The only other hint that he is not forgotten is that his hat can be seen [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1073x1074y_Ponytail_and_bird_black_hat_on_a_stick_and_Cueball_whistling.png on a stick] under the Destroyer after the three large T-like structures.  And this is not that kind of stick characters Randall usually draws. But at least we now know where Danish has hidden it from him this time (see [[405: Journal 3]]). Given that his hat is stuck there, he could also be any of the Cueballs close by…\n\nAlso [[Blondie]] seems to be only represented once, while in her reporter mode while discovering a bug before the volcano as can be seen [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/1608_0970x1077y_Kite_and_weird_bug.png here]. \n\nThere are also several characters that are not recognizable as either any of the standard xkcd characters or in any other way (see for instance a few of the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a6/1037x1073y_Wedding.png wedding guests]). But there are possibly some of the minor characters are used like [[Danish]] at the bridge in the Blockade Runner ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png here]) but this cannot be confirmed, she just looks like her and has some similarities teasing the Star Wars fan.\n\nSeveral places in the comic it is clear from the size and the behavior that some of the characters are kids, see for instance the Blondie image mentioned above, where two kids looking like Megan and Hairy stand behind her, but they would in principle not be Megan or Hairy despite appearance, as these named characters are adults.\n\nThere are also many fictive people from different movies, books, and shows; for instance Darth Vader ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fa/1608_1077x1109y_Darth_Vaders_talks_about_Steven_Universe_on_the_bridge_Megan_adjust_antenna.png here]), Gandalf ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a5/1608_0944x1083y_Rock_with_Gandalf_in_Lava_lake.png here]) and Steven Universe ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/39/1608_1031x1095y_Steven_Universe_family_and_ice_cream_prediction.png here]) all three mentioned above, and some real life people: you can find [[Elon Musk]], who has a [[#Secret passages and hidden places|hidden lair]] under the Volcano (see [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/73/1608_0945x1074y_Elon_Musks_cave_in_lair.png here]), and Gregor Mendel, hanging out on a Star Destroyer with a pea plant.\n\nFurthermore, there are many animals (like [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b0/1608_1067x1094y_Gazebo_puma_deer_Cueball_with_bow_and_talk_of_Palpatine_in_the_middle_of_the_cave.png the puma and the deer]) in the cave, some even rather big like this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b5/1608_1038x1094y_Giant_octopus_in_Destroyer.png octopus] or even gigantic like this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d2/1608_1078x1095y_Ant_Queen_in_Destroyer.png ant queen] (all three from inside the Destroyer). There are also a couple of small Star Wars robots, one in a corridor in each spaceship ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/df/1608_1034x1091y_Photon_canon_Tetris_piece_and_mini_robot_at_bottom_of_hull.png here from the Destroyer]).\n\n==Environment==\nThis is the whole comic image, without coins. The part visible at the beginning is marked red. See also a collection of different [[1608: Hoverboard/The whole image|the whole image]]!\n[[File:1608 full.png|1300px|link=1608: Hoverboard/The whole image]]\n\n===Secret passages and hidden places===\nThere are many places where you can disappear behind black areas, as not all of these are solid. You might have discovered this yourself if you stayed in the play area, as the platform below the inverted parentheses is only solid at the edges. Some of these places out of the play area even hide secret passages or hidden rooms. You can reveal them by [https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard#Cheats_and_Exploits activating goggles mode].\n\nOne notable hidden area is Elon Musk's volcano lair, which is located beneath the lava in the crater of Mount Doom. It can be difficult to find your way in here without using goggles mode even if you know it is there. (For more details, see [[1608: Hoverboard/Images of secret passages|secret passages]].)\n\nAnother hidden place is the floating rock island that floats high above the {{w|Washington Monument}}, which is almost the highest point with solid ground. It is located just outside the left edge of the play area. This island is almost impossible to find by chance, as it takes around 30 seconds of repeatedly pressing the Up Arrow key to reach it from the top of the Monument. Even if you go up enough, you will almost miss it, as the Monument is not aligned to the island. (The [[#Viewers|maps]] can help you if you're having trouble finding it.)\n\nAs there are two coins on the floating rock island and four coins in the lair below the lava, it is very hard to find all the coins. There are even several coins that are hard to find because they just float in the air nowhere near any drawn things, or at least no things you can see before seeing the coin. They may hang in the air a few jumps above the ground, or in one case more than a seconds drop below the Destroyer. Getting all coins without help from a map would truly make you a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f7/169_coins_fastest_way.PNG Gandalf-like wizard]. (See more regarding [[#Coins|coins]] below.)\n\n===Coins===\nThere are 169 total coins in the comic. For more details, see the [[1608: Hoverboard/Images coins|coins location]]. The highest-located coin in the game is beside the large rock on Rock Island, while the lowest-located coin is a toss-up between the one in the volcano lair, in the well, and on the rogue wave talking to Cueball. (There's also a coin under the lava but it's not at the bottom of the room.) On top of the eggs in the stork nest, on the far right of the image, there are ten coins. These are the most coins that can be collected in one place outside the play area.\n\nThe Coins are not part of the drawing, as they are added later and are superimposed on top of the comic image. This means they are always on top of the black parts of the image, even in secret paggsages. There are no coins located over any part of the solid bedrock or walls in the comic, but sometimes they coins are placed over some of the black parts that you can walk through. See example here [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/0b/1608_with_coin_1070_1095.png with coin] vs. [https://xkcd.com/1608/1070:-1095+s.png without coin]. The coin is here a lamp, and then when it is removed it reveals an exploded lamp and also one more insect. See a picture here of the coin delivery after [[1608: Hoverboard/Screen-shots#Reaching all the boundaries|reaching all coins and all the boundaries]].\n\nDifferent amounts of coins collected in the play area, will give different messages in yellow on the black part at the bottom of the screen when delivered to the coin collector. The table contains examples of what may be written depending on the number of coins. The time (and the amount when there is a range with similar rating) is just chosen at random (although in a realistic range).

Then, it pauses for about 1.3 seconds and repeats five times, flashing a total of 15 times in just about 11.3 seconds. The message will stop immediately if you re-enter the play area during this period. If you re-enter later, it will flash once you leave again. The play area is anything within and below the middle part of the walls just outside the starting maze.\n\n===Boundaries===\nThe whole map is 1920 pixels wide, for a length of 10,656' or 3247.9488m. The larger game world is physically bounded in the left, right, and down directions, with invisible walls to each side and the ground preventing you from going any further down than the deepest depression or hidden caves. In the upward direction there is theoretically also an invisible wall, but while jumping, [[Cueball]] and his hoverboard will appear to continue upwards as long as you jump; in addition, the longer the up arrow is pressed repeatedly, the longer it will take for Cueball to fall down again once the button is released. So, although there are no new things above, you can keep jumping as high as you like and will then fall proportionally longer to get back to where you started out. When the comic was first released, it could have been possible that there were some hidden unexplored parts. Shortly after it was posted, however, a [[#Viewers|map]] was created which covered the entire game.\n\nTo the far right is a platform at the top of a high pole. This platform turns out to be a nest (like a stork nest).\n\nTo the far left is a blond woman wearing her hair in a bun, looking right. She tells you about the Destroyer, should you have gone this way without finding it yet.\n:Woman: In the sky, beyond the mountain, I saw a starship.\n\nThe highest straight rise into the air to something other than white is Rock Island, just left of and very high over the Washington monument. Standing on the large rock on top of the Island, you are standing almost as high up as possible (the very top of the bridge on the Destroyer is just a tad higher). There is a coin here one step next to the rock. This is the highest located coin in the game. Going over Rock Island's edge also represents the largest possible drop in the game.\n\nAs for the deepest parts of the image, the volcano lair and the deep well (halfway to the volcano on the left) are tied. The deepest part where you can stand, however, is in the ocean below the Destroyer where a rogue wave is talking to Cueball:\n:Wave: I know rogue waves seem implausible, but we're a straightforward consequence of the equations of fluid dynamics.\n:Cueball: ... But you can talk?\n:Wave: The equations are really complicated.\n\nTaking a route through all the extremes mentioned here (the lowest, highest, leftmost, and rightmost solid positions within the game) can be achieved in about 9 minutes and 30 seconds. It takes 1 minute and 52 to get from the starting point to the leftmost edge. While we do not have a definite speed for the hoverboard, we can obtain the dimensions of the map by using the Washington monument. Assuming it reflects the real-life dimension of the monument, it is 100 pixels tall, while the actual monument is 555'. This means that 1 pixel is about 5.55 real-world inches.\n\n===All images===\nCoordinates for the images are given in (X, Y) coordinates with the starting point at [https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png (1000, 1074)]. \nIn total there are 3440 images on xkcd that can be accessed via links of this format: https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png [This link is for the (1000, 1074) starting point image.] '''Here is a page with a table of all the links to images: [[1608: Hoverboard/All image links|All image links]].''' The individual images are so small and cut off at \"random\" intervals, so you will often be unable to see both a person what they're sayin in the same image.\nSee for instance this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a6/1037x1073y_Wedding.png wedding scene] to the right under the Destroyer, which only makes sense when these four images are put together (as they are in the link): [https://xkcd.com/1608/1037:-1073+s.png (1037, 1073)] — [https://xkcd.com/1608/1037:-1074+s.png (1037, 1074)] — [https://xkcd.com/1608/1038:-1073+s.png (1038, 1073)] — [https://xkcd.com/1608/1038:-1074+s.png (1038, 1074)]\n\nThe maximum possible number of images in the x-direction is 180. Going left will decrease X down to 928 (so 82 pictures left of the starting point in X-direction). Going right will increase X up to 1107 (so 107 pictures left of the starting point in X-direction). The total possible images in the y-direction are 44. Going down will decrease Y down to 1069 (so 5 pictures down from the starting point in Y-direction) Going up will increase Y up to 1112 (so 38 pictures up from the starting point in Y-direction)\n\nThe number of possible active Y-images depends on the X-coordinate, as there are several non-existing images that are not just totally white (i.e. blank images), but which don't even have a number/or active link on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com]. The top active image over the floating island and over the top of the bridge section of the Destroyer all have Y coordinate 1112. There are only 20 active images at this Y-coordinate. The same also goes for the X coordinate: above X=1076 there are also many non-existing images with not active link. All possible images are thus spread over a 180 x 44 grid, with a possible 7920 images. But 4480 of these images are non-existing on xkcd, but you can travel through them in the game, as they are just shown as completely blank/white empty air in the game. If you try to load one of the completely blank images like [https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1077+s.png (1000, 1077)], three images above the starting point, you will get an error message. There are only 76 (vs 180) images at this Y-coordinate.\n\nNote there are several completely empty/white images that are active, but those can be loaded on xkcd like the one below the missing picture mentioned above: [https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1076+s.png (1000, 1076)]. There are no blank images in completely black areas, like inside structures or underground. And below Y = 1077 all 180 possible Y-images exist for all X-coordinates, from Y = 1069 to 1076. For instance, the image below the starting point is completely black [https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1073+s.png (1000, 1073)], and so are the next three below. The bottom images at Y = 1069 has a white border at the bottom: [https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1069+s.png (1000, 1069)]. All the images at Y = 1069 are the same except the one at the very right edge because at this edge there is also a white border to the right [https://xkcd.com/1608/1107:-1069+s.png (1107, 1069)] (this is not the case to the far left at [https://xkcd.com/1608/928:-1069+s.png (928, 1069)]). You will never see the images at Y = 1069 in the game. Actually, you will neither see anything of the images with Y = 1070 or 1071. And there is nothing that is not completely black for Y = 1069 to 1072. First from Y = 1073 are there active images which includes white. This picture with the wave at [https://xkcd.com/1608/1022:-1073+s.png (1022, 1073)] gives the lowest point where the hoverboard Cueball can actually stand. Since you will sink into the water here, you are almost standing on the top of the Y = 1072 image: [https://xkcd.com/1608/1022:-1072+s.png (1022, 1072)], which is of course completely black.\n\nHere is a list of the places where there are most images at a given X coordinate:\n\n*At X = 1078, right under the highest point of the Destroyers bridge [https://xkcd.com/1608/1078:-1112+s.png (1078, 1112)] there are 36 active images. Thus, even here 8 images are missing between the bottom active image below the Destroyer and the first active near the ground level at Y=1076. (Y = 1077 to 1084 are missing).\n\n*These missing Y coordinates are active in other places, for instance under the torpedo rain at X = 1020 where all Y images are active up until 1100 - 32 images. But since the last twelve images above this are missing it is still four less than under the bridge.\n\n*Under the floating island, where there are active images at the top Y = 1112, like [https://xkcd.com/1608/990:-1112+s.png (990, 1112)], there is also the Washington monument below which goes high up, but still there are only 20 active Y images, as there are no active images between 1084 and 1109 (24 missing in between).\n\n*Over the volcano's edges the highest images directly connecting to solid ground is found at Y = 1087. One image above this is also active making the height here going up to 1088, thus also making it twenty active Y images. The only '''not''' completely white image over the volcano at Y = 1088 is the one with the eagles [https://xkcd.com/1608/956:-1088+s.png (956, 1088)].\n\n==Details and references==\nOn the page [[1608: Hoverboard/Images of individual scenes]], images covering all individual scenes (in full size and with coins) has been saved and uploaded to be used for reference in the [[#Table with references|table]] below from where they are linked directly.

Here are some examples:\n\n*[[1133: Up Goer Five]], the comic that was the impetus for the book. These are both referenced in this game by the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e2/1608_0976x1079y_Space_capsule_with_parachutes.png space capsule] used for re-entry by the astronauts that flew to the moon using the {{w|Saturn V|Saturn Five}} rocket. This capsule is floating down over the plateau before the volcano to the left. \n\n*In ''Sky Toucher'', the last entry explaining a skyscraper, there are several references to the game, one of these being the space capsule just mentioned above. Other references:\n**Ponytail throwing a paper plane out, which she also does [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/20/1608_1077x1107y_Tarkin_on_the_bridge_and_Ponytail_with_paper_plane.png below the bridge] of the Destroyer.

Being up in a kite is also referenced in both [[235: Kite]] and in the title text of [[1614: Kites]] (from just a few weeks after the release of this comic.)\n**There is a floor in the middle of the building with trees, just like there is a cave inside the Destroyer [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/75/1608_1053x1093y_Lake_with_tree_birds_and_puma_on_rock_at_exit_in_the_bottom_left_side_of_the_cave.png with a tree \"inside\"].\n**Cueball is holding a fishing rod out over the side of the building letting the hook hand in the air.

The shape of the octopus is the same as the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b5/1608_1038x1094y_Giant_octopus_in_Destroyer.png silhouette of a giant octopus] inside the Destroyer. Octopuses like this are often used in xkcd, and they are also included in the explanation about ''Writing sticks'' (as the source of ink for the pens), as a motive in ''Picture taker'' and in ''Tree of life''. As an example, from another xkcd comic with octopuses see for instance [[435: Purity]].\n**There is also a bowling alley in the hull of the ship - a reference to the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/53/1608_0987x1075y_Hamsterball_bowling.png hamster ball bowling] in the left part of the world. Bowling is also used two other places in the book, namely on the suspension of the longest bridge in ''Tall roads'' and a bowling alley is used for measuring length in ''How to count things''. \n\n*Ants are used three times in the book. A zoom-in on an ant is used to indicate size in ''Earth's past'' about geological ages of the Earth, and under the ''Tree'' in that explanation there is an ant colony where one ant is much bigger than the others; an ant queen, a clear reference to the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d2/1608_1078x1095y_Ant_Queen_in_Destroyer.png ant queen] in the Destroyer. They are of course also in the ''Tree of life''.\n\n*Basketball is shown twice in this comic ([https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a4/1608_0936x1084y_Basketball_on_the_volcano.png left of volcano] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1d/1608_1067x1104y_Basket_ball_on_top_of_Destroyer.png on top of Destroyer]).

The table first goes through the entire image from left to right along the ground (i.e., going up the volcano and down in the lair, down the well and up to the top of the Washington Monument.) Then, it goes back to the Rebel Runner, and after that follows the torpedoes up to the Star Destroyer. Finally, it goes through the Star Destroyer from tip to rear in four sections, taking everything within each section top to bottom, before moving on to the next section. In the table are the following columns:\n\n*'''Description''' of the scene depicted in the overview links. If the scene is a zoomed-out overview that covers the images below, its explanation is in '''bold'''. This can be used as a guide to where in the image the scenes are located, unless you sort by column.\n\n*'''Transcript'''. Any text has only been transcribed once. If some scenes overlap, the text has only been written in the first or the one where the text is most central. Also, overviews that has been zoomed out aren'ttranscribedd and are listed as (N/A). However, (None) means the scene doesn't contain text. By sorting the transcript, the scenes with text are shown first.\n\n*'''Overview links'''. There can be many, but the first will always be the overview. If there are secret passages or hiddend environment, two versions of the images are included. The second version, ''Hidden passages in red'', marks these passages in red instead of black.\n\n*'''Tiles (X, Y)'''. For the standard images, there is also a link to the defining image tile on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com].\n\n*'''References'''. Three things are referenced many times, and each has their own column so the table can be sorted on these:\n**'''SW''': {{w|Star Wars}}\n**'''LOTR''': {{w|The Lord of the Rings}}\n**'''TE''': [[Thing Explainer]]\n**'''Other'''. There is also a column for \"other\" types of references so they can also be sorted, without drowning in the three recurring types of references. These can also be sorted, since they start with \"Comics:\", \"Movies:\", etc.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Description\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Transcript\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Overview links\n! colspan=\"2\" | Tiles (X, Y)\n! colspan=\"4\" | References\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explanation\n|-\n!

She beat them both and it looks like a very ordinary bike she rides. The all-time record for downhill racing is not using the ashy slopes on volcanos but from racing on snow, and here the record is not in danger from Ponytail as it is a staggering 138&nbsp;mph (222&nbsp;km/h) again with a lesser record for serial produced bikes of 130&nbsp;mph (210&nbsp;km/h).

Cueball is even opening the hatch during descend to increase this chance, which would be highly dangerous. Also normally they would land in water (which will though not be the case this time). The reason he does this is that they wish to know how many more likes they (and their mission) has received during the reentry. This would have been relevant if the moon landings had taken place today. There where no social media or internet back in 1969.

So, this is why this real girl explains that she is actually not a ghost, she just like wells and thus likes to sit in the cold water at the bottom of wells. This could be very dangerous, and she will probably have a hard time getting up. It is also a very deep well, so falling into this well might very well be lethal. There are also many stories (in this case also real stories like the one about {{w|Jessica McClure}}) about kids that fall into wells, some of them surviving being stuck for several days in the wells. Also, in movies this story is often used, for instance in {{w|Batman Begins}} the young Bruce Wayne falls down a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a fear of bats.\n|-\n|Entire gas station with birds above\n|\n:(N/A)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b3/1608_0982x1079y_Gas_station_with_birds_above_with_coin_on_string.png Overview]<br>[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/83/1608_0982x1079y_Gas_station_with_birds_above_without_coin_on_string.png Without coin]\n|Overview\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The two birds with a coin between them flying above the gas station is way too high up, to be discovered when just moving normally over the gas station, even jumping once up from the highest spot.

It will have taken considerable skills to land this close to the station without hitting the cover over the stander. Ponytail is sitting in the shop with a coin. This is the first coin to be discovered when going left from the play-area. There is a long stretch without coins to begin with. The coins on the rock island in the sky it on this stretch, but so far above that most people would miss them altogether. There is also a coin with two birds straight above the right wing on the X-wing. But about three jumps up, so it is easy to miss. To get into the shop you need to go over the stander and back.

Someone asks how they happened to be in England and there is discussion about migratory birds like {{w|swallows}} and the possibility that they have brought the coconuts along with them.

The first three lines of the quote goes as in the film, but then it turns out that the girl is properly referring to the Star Destroyer that would be clearly visible from this cliff as it covers almost the entire right part of this world from just beyond the play-area. (They do not look high enough to see the rock island in the sky, and it would also not cast shadow over an entire region.) As it is not certain players coming here have already been to the right to see the Destroyer it is not necessarily clear that the reply from Cueball should apply to the Destroyer. But if it does then it would be the Emperor Palpatine that he refers to as God. The emperor is on board the Destroyer near the bridge at the very top rear end of the spaceship and has God like powers. It could however also just be a general reference to the {{w|God}} and thus be inferred as if God cast a shadow over an entire region (country). Maybe just in general as if he has a place in the sky that cast a shadow (like sitting on a cloud). Alternatively, it could be the people who believe too much in any God, which can be viewed as living under a shadow, as they will not try to see any reality if it does not fit with their religious beliefs.\n|-\n|Hamster ball bowling.\n|\n:(None)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/53/1608_0987x1075y_Hamsterball_bowling.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/987:-1075+s.png (987, 1075)]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/989:-1074+s.png (989, 1074)]\n|\n|\n|{{yesno|yy}}\n|Comics: [[:Category:Hamster balls|Hamster ballscategory]]\n|There have been several xkcd comics with human sized hamster balls, and there is even one more in this comic up in the Destroyer.

By \"Washington\" he could be referring to the city of Washington DC or to the real Washington monument, but he is probably referring to the first US President George Washington, since monuments often depict (look like) the person they are dedicated to, but the real Washington monument is not meant to look like Washington himself. Cueball seems to have expected all presidential monuments to include a statue of the honored president and is confused and disappointed when the monument fails to meet his expectations. Of course, since this is the only Washington based building in the game it is true that the place doesn't look like the city. If he refers to the monument, then it can be questioned if this is because the monument is not an exact replica (in proportions and/or scale). In any case it is clearly meant as an indicator that this is supposed to look like the monument, and with the tip's apex being made of aluminum (see that scene) as on the real monument, there can be no doubt what is referenced. It is possible to get to the left side of the monument without going up to see the tip, if the player immediately understands the sign with the white arrow that points to a hidden passage through the base of the monument, as can be seen in the second image with the hidden passages shown in red.\n\nTo the left of the monument there is a flagpole with a blown-out flag. It is all black, but it should be the {{w|Flag of the United States|the Stars and Stripes}} as there are fifty flag poles with the US flag (one for each [[1653: United States Map|state]]) surrounding the monument in a circle. On top of the pole there sits a duck looking left. Towards the end of the world to the left on top of the left volcanic rim there also sits a similar duck looking right.\n|-\n|Tip of Washington monument with Cueball and White Hat\n|\n:Cueball: Look at that- Solid aluminum!\n:Cueball: We´re gonna be rich!\n:White Hat: Uh, what the heck is ''that?!''\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6f/1608_0995x1083y_Tip_of_Washington_monument.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/995:-1083+s.png (995, 1083)]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/995:-1084+s.png (995, 1084)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The tip of the monument is actually {{w|Washington_Monument#Aluminum_apex|made of solid aluminum}} and at the time this {{w|aluminum}} apex was installed it was a rare metal as valuable as {{w|silver}}, but today it is maybe about 1/300 as valuable as silver.

Just before a {{w|wedding}} it is sometimes customary to ask if any in the crowd could give a cause why these two people should not be wed. What is not customary is to threaten those who do have any objections that they would then have to plead these in front of the great gangster boss from Star Wars, {{w|Jabba the Hutt}}. In case he has condoned this wedding, you may end up pleading for him to kill you mercifully if you did object anyway. The normal form of the priest's question goes more [https://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/marriage.pdf like this]: \"If any of you can show just cause why they may not lawfully be married, speak now; or else for ever hold your peace.\" (See the top of page 4 of the pdf file in the link (page 424) and a discussion about this sentences use [https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=635317 in real life]).\n\nBeyond the wedding, another Megan is sitting on a large boulder facing the wedding, and behind her a third Cueball is having a picnic with a second Ponytail. The question here is if Megan looks at the wedding or turns her back to the picnic. Depending if the player went right along the ground to begins with and saw the wedding first or went through the Destroyer and came back the other way and saw the picnic first the players preconceptions on these questions may be completely different.

Standing on the rock with Megan hoverboard Cueball cannot see either of the scenes, but standing between Megan and either scene, she can be seen together with either of the relevant Cueball and another girl. In the first case with the wedding, she might have wished she had the courage to speak up in spite of the Jabba threat. In the other case she may feel rejected by the happy picnic couple and has turned her back to them. Poor Megan.

Since no one really speaks the language anymore, and only few learn it well enough to just read any sentence, by doing so you actually hide this motto that you probably would like to tell people about. The only Latin that has entered popular usage are generally idioms, like {{w|Carpe diem}} (seize the day), etc. (et cetera, meaning \"and the rest\"). However, most of the time, like the one Megan is explaining to her friend, it would make much more sense to just write it in your native language (English in this case); but then of course there would be no need for a motto, where you ask yourself why you are speaking Latin. In this way, the joke is quite self-referential. There is also a cemetery in Click and Drag.\n\nThe Latin in the motto is not correct, but close, and it could both be Randall's accidental errors or purposeful errors (as there are probably many \"private\" mottoes out there that are not completely correct. <br> The original sentence:\n\n'''Cur''' - why. <br>'''Ego''' - I.<br>'''Committitur''' - can be translated as \"start\", but is incorrectly conjugated; in view of the proper translation, a more acceptable word would be \"commisi\".<br>'''Dictar''' - likely a misspelling of \"dictare\", an acceptable translation of \"to speak\". <br>'''Latinae''' - Latin, but in the wrong case; a more correct translation would probably be \"Latinam\".<br>A possible translation of this sentence is therefore \"Why did I start to speak Latin?\". The word ''just'' is completely missing and could have been included by using ''modo''. However, Megan could have added it to make it more \"natural\" in English. In this way, the family motto given here is a slightly misused satirical statement on Latin family mottoes.\n|-\n|Huge foot.\n|\n:Cueball: It says \"Yo, future dirtbags!

Typically old relics from the past has been demolished, and if only part of a human body is displayed (at least when it is not just a {{w|Bust (sculpture)|bust}} supposed to only have head and shoulders), then it is often assumed that the rest of the statue has been lost. Just like the missing arms of the ancient Greek statue {{w|Venus de Milo}}. These arms were there originally. But as it turns out as Cueball reads the transcription someone in the past just wished to show the future his huge foot. Suggesting that this is either actual size, or just that he was very proud of at least one of his feet. He also mocks anyone reading the inscription by calling them the derogating word [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dirtbag dirtbags]. This is a recent work so if this were an ancient monument it would be highly unlikely that it said that. Of course, it could be Cueballs translation of what is actually written, or as this is not necessarily old, it is not just part of the original monument but the entire unbroken statue of a foot, then it could be a contemporary artist who made it. However, it is just in front of the pyramid to the right, and in front of the real pyramid {{w|Pyramid of Khafre}} the {{w|Great Sphinx of Giza}}, also much larger than life size lies. (It has lost its nose by the way). So, this could be the games version of such a large statue in front of a pyramid.\n\nAs from the scene to the left of this giant foot, the inscription that Cueball reads is probably in Latin, in which case it could have read something along the lines of: ''Io, de futuro sacculo terra! Reprehendo sicco meus ingens radices!'' (which could be translated back to ''Io, for the future of the bag, earth Check out my huge foot!'', since there were no words for ''Yo dirtbags'' in Latin.\n\nThis is likely to be a reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem ''{{w|Ozymandias}}'', which starts:\n I met a traveller from an antique land,\n Who said: \"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\n Stand in the desert.

First on the bridge itself a long-haired woman (the captain) is mocking both Star Wars and Star Trek fans alike by using the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcRX0Gw1aaw opening line] from the Star Trek series about stating the {{w|stardate}} for the captain's log on board the first spaceship ever shown in the Star Wars franchise. Hairbun behind her (it could be {{w|Princess Leia}} who also has buns but above each ear) is clearly distressed by this \"mistake\". This could either be because she is a Star Wars fan that dislike Star Trek or because the stardate used is the real date, November 24, 2015, on which the comic was released (as well as the book ''Thing Explainer'') instead of using the normal convention for stardates with a four or five digit number plus a decimal like 1513.1. Given that the long-haired woman has the appearance of [[Danish]], this may be intentionally rather than a mistake. There is another reference to the Star Trek universe in the scene where the torpedoes are fired from the Destroyer above, so no less than two Trek infiltrations in the opening scene of Star Wars.\n\nBeneath the bridge there is a smaller room where Ponytail and Megan spoofs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X69NCLxwLEY Luke's Lightsaber Training] from the original Star Wars movie where {{w|Luke Skywalker}} practices under {{w|Ben Kenobi}}'s guidance while {{w|Han Solo}} comes with snide remarks.

There is a similar cannon with a coin in front on top of the Destroyer. Beneath this cannon is a tiny room where another Cueball is pouring several small bullets from a bucket into a black box labeled bullets (for the cannon). From this room there is a small shaft down to the main corridor in the Runner. But this shaft is too slim for hoverboard Cueball to pass up through it, or rather for the board to get in. Cueball can pass into the hole, but the board holds him back from reaching up in the small room. The cannon below has two of the anchors from the wires going to the ground attached around its barrel. The third anchor is stuck in the bottom hull further down the hull. It is unclear how this last has become attached to the hull!\n\nIn the corridor that runs away from the bridge a small robot on wheels drive towards left.

Further down the corridor Ponytail is walking to the right while singing indicated with two notes.\n\nAbove the cannon at the bottom of the hull on a ledge with an entry to the ship is a third Cueball holding a fishing rod out over the ledge, so the hook hangs in the air. Maybe he is fishing for either of the two birds that are flying around the line.

The sentence uttered by First Cueball is said by a Storm Trooper to Darth Vader. The [https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes?qt=qt0440708 rest of the quote] is not quite like in the comic. Rather is goes like this:\n:Darth Vader: [addressing the Tantive IV's captain, whom he is interrogating] Where are those transmissions you intercepted? WHAT have you DONE with those plans?\n:Captain Antilles: We intercepted no transmissions... This is a consular ship... We're on a diplomatic mission...\n:Darth Vader: [shouting] If this is a consular ship, WHERE is the ambassador?\n:Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! \nThe comic jokes with the way Darth Vader seems to assume that if the plans had been found on the computer, then no one else would have had access to them. The second Cueball, although not Vader, represents a superior that have absolutely no idea about how computers work, in spite of his insistence that he actually do. If the data has once been intercepted, they could have been shared or copied to several other computers or devices or even been printed. By finding them in the main computer they would only make sure that they were indeed intercepted, but not be certain that they have not been delivered to the rebel base.\n\nThe other two Cueballs on top of the ship stand over a hole in the hull going into a small room above and left of the large room. It seems that the fourth Cueball has made this hole directly from the outside (i.e. it is not caused by an exploding torpedo from the Destroyer above). Because he confirms when the third Cueball asks if he just came down to make the hole without permission. The third Cueball thinks this is rude. This is, of course, hilarious as if a space pirate or any other attacker of a spaceship would ask permission before attacking. And also, the idea that he might get permission for asking is likewise crazy. To call this rude is also a weird way to look at such an attack. {{w|C3PO}} uses [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWoG9tKf1lA this as reply] to a comment made to him by a similar droid in the second movie.\n|-\n|Top rear end of the Rebel Blockade Runner.\n|\n:First scene:\n:First Cueball: That thing is ''huge.

Beginning with the scene to the far left the two first Cueballs discuss what type of Star Destroyer is shooting at their ship from above them. They are clearly tilting their head far back to look up. The first Cueball comments on how huge it is and asks if it is an {{w|Star_Destroyer#Imperial_class|''Imperial'' class}} Destroyer. \"''Imperial'' class\" is the designation of the Destroyer ''[https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Devastator Devastator]'' that followed the Rebel Runner ''Tantive IV'' in the opening scene. There is also and more than 10 times as large version called a {{w|Star_Destroyer#Super_Star_Destroyer|Super Star Destroyer}}, which were featured in the two sequels in the original trilogy. But even the original Star Destroyers were improved during the movies, so when the improved Destroyers came out, they became known as ([https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Imperial_II-class_Star_Destroyer Mark II], Mk-II or plainly II, and the original (as Devastator) became known as [https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Imperial_I-class_Star_Destroyer Mk-1]. The second Cueball agrees with the first and suggest that it is a Mk-1 and thus makes it even more clear that this scene is actually the opening scene of the original Star Wars movie. But then again, he continues, it depends weather this is the {{w|Star Wars expanded universe|expanded universe}} (now known as ''Star Wars Legends'') where all  authorized media (books etc.) released based on the Star Wars franchise should be counted in, or if it is only the movies sanctioned directly by George Lucas (and now Disney). What he says is that in all those works there could be so many other types os ships mentioned, that he could mistake for a Mk-1, that in that universe he would not be certain at all. But in the \"official\" universe he would claim that it was a Mk-1 ''Imperial'' class Star Destroyer.\n\nIn the next scene Ponytail and a third Cueball fight with bows and arrows against the Destroyers 100+ torpedoes raining down from above. Ten of these can be seen falling, one hits the ship, and one has just exploded in a big ''boom'', to be compared with the feeble ''twang'' made by Cueballs bow when he fires the arrow. When later discovering how far there is up to the bottom of the Destroyer it only becomes even more silly.\n\nIn the third scene two more Cueballs (four and five) look up at the torpedoes falling down in an arch over their heads. The fourth Cueball asks why they still keep firing. And the fifth Cueball tries to explain. A {{w|Gun turret|turret}} is generally a weapon mount that houses the crew and a projectile-firing weapon and lets the weapon be aimed and fired in a given cone of fire. So, it is this crew, that are the turret operators. There is also such [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/bc/1608_1012x1078y_Bridge_on_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png an operator] on the Rebel Runner below the top cannon (or turret), in the scene with the bridge. The reason they keep fighting is given that they just do their own thing and that is annoying. This indicates that these two Cueballs do no longer think that the Destroyer needs to fire anymore on the Runner, and thus also indicates that they are part of the crew from the Destroyer send down to take over the Runner. Thus, it is annoying that the shooting has not stopped as it puts them in danger. If they belong to the Runner, then they would not think it weird that the shooting continued. It turns out to be Megan who is the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5f/1608_1034x1091y_Torpedo_canon_below_Destroyer.png turret operator in the Destroyer]! At least they can be happy that it is regular torpedoes. (See the explanation of the scene regarding the Torpedo cannon below Destroyer).\n\nIn the final scene at the very end of the hull is the sixth Cueball together with Megan. She holds on to him as he tries to toast a giant marshmallow on a stick by holding it in front of the exhaust pipe of the Runner. This would most likely melt the marshmallow instantaneously... In ''Red world space car'' in TE the Mars rower also toasts a marshmallow on a stick over a small fire.\n|-\n|Bottom rear end of the Rebel Blockade Runner.\n|\n:(None)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5b/1608_1020x1078y_Bottom_rear_end_of_the_Rebel_Blockade_Runner.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1020:-1078+s.png (1020, 1078)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The rear end of the Rebel Runner with the last part of the big Death Star plan room to visible to the left.

This large section is the section in which [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e1/1608_Entire_Rebel_Blockade_Runner_swallowed_by_Destroyer.png the Destroyer swallows the Rebel Runner] in the opening scene of the first Star Wars movie, as mentioned in the overview above.\n\nBehind the two women, who are standing on a thin ledge where the large gap ends, there is another car (see scene above). At least it is clear how this car could get into this room (and out again). Above the car there is a coin. Behind the car there is a corridor going into the Destroyer, but quite high up on the wall for a normal exit. The car cannot be used as a step to jump in there, as it is not part of the solid picture. \n|-\n|Ponytail flying up a shaft towards a coin.\n|\n:(None)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/76/1608_1053x1091y_Ponytail_flying_up_a_shaft_towards_a_coin.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1053:-1091+s.png (1053, 1091)]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1054:-1091+s.png (1054, 1091)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The corridor from the room with Megan and the car is long. In the middle of it there is a shaft going up (a long way). Just inside this shaft Ponytail is seen flying up, hands in front of her like another Superman. Above her in the shaft there is a coin. This is not the only place in the comic where Ponytail is flying. Although here it seems like an automatic thing (like Superman), whereas down below on the ground below the Destroyer she has to flap her arms violently, but then actually manages to take off from the ground. In a spaceship like this Destroyer there could both be a system to let people float upwards, some gravitational effects or just plain effects of the flying itself, whereas down on the ground flying like that would be magic for sure. But at least there seems to be some correlation since it is Ponytail that flies in both cases.\n|-\n|Trap covered with leaves and flying Ponytail at bottom of hull.\n|\n:Cueball: ...And we cover it with leaves so no one sees it.\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fd/1608_1055x1090y_Trap_covered_with_leaves_and_flying_Ponytail_at_bottom_of_hull.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1055:-1090+s.png (1055, 1090)]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1055:-1091+s.png (1055, 1091)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|After the shaft where Ponytail flies up (see more in the scene above) the corridor continues to a pit which Cueball and a kid have been covering with leaves and sticks.

Alternatively (given the words Cueball uses), they have made this hole by mistake, and now tries to cover it so no one sees it.

This interpretation can further be extended to the very front end, where there is the appearance of a head that eats coins (see the front-end overview) and at the rear end a coin is bouncing out at the very last shaft before the very end of the ship. Suggesting where this animal gets rid of the waste products afterwards.

As there are coins at both end of this section it is quite clear that these coins are moved along by the corridor itself. The indentation of the corridor is so strong that the corridor is not wide enough to allow hoverboard Cueball to pass through. So, to get both coins another route needs to be found. The shortest way is to go up the shaft behind Hairbun, passing the two empty rooms with coins on the way to the top of the Destroyers hull. To get to the other side hoverboard Cueball will then have to pass through the Destroyers colon like structure to the right. See below.

As can be seen there is a very deep black hole beneath the surface of the cotton (which Ponytail states is cotton).

Given that hoverboard Cueball is not affected by the cotton and can move either up again, or out left or right it is not a trap for him.

Similar systems are referenced in [[1737: Datacenter Scale]]. This system is generally used in large server rooms, where a room with fire will be sealed off from the rest of the servers, and the inert gas will flow into the room, extinguishing the fire, at the cost of whatever was in the room. Since this could be deadly these systems are only legal in rooms with little or no human interaction. The character on the left (Possibly Megan with hair buns) starts off by describing this system, though the system on the star destroyer has the key difference of piping in oxygen, instead of nitrogen, which Ponytail questions. Megan responds \"Uhh, ''Boring''.\" which is technically true. An Inert gas will have a little visible effect, and the fire will slowly die. Piping in oxygen, however, is not a valid way to extinguish flames, as it would feed the fire instead of extinguishing it, though, if you have an adequate seal, this might not be as much of a problem as it sounds. The fire will eventually consume all of the oxygen and die. Unfortunately, there are 3 problems with this. The first is simple: there are people on a star destroyer, and this system will kill them if they happen to be near the fire. The second is that in addition to simply feeding the fire the oxygen is explosive, which could potentially blow the doors that seal the decks, allowing the fire to spread. The third is in the wording of (Megan?); who says that it will seal off the affected ''deck'' which is SW generally refers to an entire level. While this may just be a wording error by Randall, given the humor of the rest of the system, it would not be a great leap to imagine a system that seals off a whole floor regardless of the size of the fire, killing everyone on that floor. In addition, given that the Empire is evil, it is also not a stretch to believe that they would kill an entire deck for a small fire just because the alternative is boring. This kind of scenario was in fact explored in the novel {{w|Star Wars: Lost Stars}} where it is described that entire decks were destroyed during the scene in {{w|The Empire Strikes Back}} where a star destroyer chases the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field. This destruction is pointed out in the novel and dismissed, as it is in this comic.\n|-\n|Darth Vader’s gold bullion and Cueball and Ponytail in small room at the top of the hull.\n|\n:Cueball: Aha!

Ants are also used twice in TE A zoom in on an ant is used to indicate size in ''Earth's past'' and under the ''Tree'' in that explanation there is an ant colony where one ant is much bigger than the others: an ant queen, a clear reference to the ant queen in the Destroyer. The other comic is a discussion running along exactly the same template ending in ''Eww''.\n\nThis is probably a reference to a part of Orson Scott Card's \"Xenocide\" in his Ender series. In it, the main character, Ender, visits a hive queen \"bugger\" he saved on his travels and became friends with, at a time after the queen has settled in on a new planet. At one point, Ender brings other humans to meet the queen at a time when she was giving birth to some of her drones. This is most likely meant to represent a parody of that conversation or else represent a comedic idea of his first conversation with her when she had been birthing, where Ender is alone and is speaking to the Hive Queen. In this version, when he finds out that she is in the process of birthing more ants, rather than being compassionate and understanding with the Queen (as he is in the book), Ender is weirded out like the other humans he brings along with him later. \n|-\n|Entire shafts from top to bottom towards the rear end.\n|\n:(N/A)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/ce/1608_Entire_shafts_from_top_to_bottom_towards_the_rear_end.png Overview]\n|Overview\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|This is the longest shaft in the Destroyer, and with the other shaft going out at the rear end, it is possible to go from the top room at the emperor and out beneath in a very short time.\n|-\n|Coin in the longest shaft.\n|\n:(None)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5a/1608_1084x1099y_Coin_in_the_longest_shaft.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1084:-1099+s.png (1084, 1099)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Might be a reference to how the emperor fell to his first death by being thrown down a shaft in the throne room by Darth Vader onboard the 2nd Death Star in Return of the Jedi.\n|-\n|Cueball and Megan hanging on to each other in a shaft figuring this out.\n|\n:Cueball: Okay\n:Cueball: We can figure this out.\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c4/1608_1084x1095y_Cueball_and_Megan_hanging_on_to_each_other_in_a_shaft_figuring_this_out.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1084:-1095+s.png (1084, 1095)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Possibly a reference to a similar scene in \"The Emperor's New Groove\", although neither character here is obviously a llama.\n|-\n|Zoom out on light bulb with corridor and other room.\n|\n:(N/A)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5b/1608_1084x1092y_Zoom_out_on_light_bulb_with_corridor_and_other_room.png Overview]\n|Overview\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Giant light bulb room.\n|\n:(None)\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d2/1608_1084x1090y_Giant_light_bulb_room.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1084:-1090+s.png (1084, 1090)]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1085:-1090+s.png (1085, 1090)]\n|\n|\n|{{yesno|yy}}\n|\n|In ''The pieces everything is made of'' in TE a light bulb is used as reference for the entry on tungsten as the filament in such bulbs is made from this element.\n|-\n|Hairbun proposition room and Cueball losing his sandwich at the rear end.\n|\n:Hairbun: Use a proposition instead of a preposition if you need something to end a sentence with, baby.\n\n:Cueball: My sandwich!\n|[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/63/1608_1086x1091y_Hair_Bun_Girl_proposition_room_and_Cueball_losing_his_sandwich_at_the_rear_end.png Overview]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1086:-1091+s.png (1086, 1091)]\n|[https://xkcd.com/1608/1089:-1091+s.png (1089, 1091)]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|One comment is inside the other on the outside of the Destroyer.

This is one of the rare incidences where there are two almost identically Megans in one scene.\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Technical aspects==\nThe game was made by [https://chromakode.com Max Goodman] who has previously worked on [[1416: Pixels]]. The source code for the game can be found [https://xkcd.com/1608/tigl.js here].\n\n===Functionality===\nBy observing page code while playing, the game grabs and displays images based on location, and subsequently clears all non-visible images. The game uses what seems to be a position syntax to retrieve the intended images live and returns an error if such an image does not exist, such as a blank area. This technically means things could be added to the world and updated live. If the player is moving sufficiently fast or if the internet connection is slow, this means that the player can get stuck in a black area that does not load in time.\n\nThis also means that the game does not have coded top or bottom limits, so any attempt to find the ''ceiling'' of the game will be futile unless the game is tweaked. The game does however have side limits, and it is not possible to go down further than image with Y coordinate 1073 (and it goes down to 1069 in the full image), so there is a bottom limit in the game. If using a [[#Cheats|cheat mode]] this may be different.\n\nThere are a couple of issues in the game. On a slow connection, it's possible to move into an 'open' area before the black image loads and permanently traps you immobile (unless you [[#Cheats|cheat]]). Sometimes, the timing of the game is completely off, which can make Cueball move extremely slowly or quickly, which makes the images jump and makes the graphic look worse. The latter error was actually used to discover something about how you move when pressing the arrows - see under [[#Functionality|Functionality]]. If the focus switches from the game to the page, the Cueball can freeze in midair. The same thing can happen if the window border overlaps the play area.\n\nThe keyboard controls are as follows:\n\n*'''Go Left''' - Left arrow key, a or h\n*'''Go Right''' - Right arrow key, d or l\n*'''Go Up (jump or hover)''' - Up arrow key, w, or k\n*'''Go Down (if gravity disabled)''' - Down arrow key, s, or j\n\nThis control scheme covers the three commonly used directional key sets: WASD a set of keys commonly used by modern games; HJKL a set of movement keys used by vi and applications which attempt to mimic vi key controls (vim); and the arrow keys, the most generic set of keys which is usually accepted by most applications which take movement as input, these were commonly used in older games.\n\nOn devices which have a touch screen and tilt sensor (portable devices like mobile phones and tablets) the controls are as follows:\n*'''Go Left''' - Roll the device anticlockwise\n*'''Go Right''' - Roll the device clockwise\n*'''Go Up (jump or hover)''' - Tap the screen\n\nAfter inspecting the source code, there appears to be no way to move down on a portable device, this is only relevant if gravity is disabled (see [[#Cheats|Cheats]]).\n\nIf you keep down the left/right control, you will keep moving along in that direction as long as no object blocks you.\nA jump will only take you a certain height. The jump is initially very quick, then gravity stops you and reverts the direction. When descending, you accelerate quickly but reach a terminal velocity after a few seconds. If you jump repeatedly while keeping a left/right control down, you will jump in that direction. If you only jump once while holding down the direction control, then you will stop moving forward after about 2.8s. From then on, you will just keep falling straight down or stop where you reached if on the ground. This makes quite a difference when you jump into an opening from a high structure. If the background is completely white, you cannot see that you do not continue to move forward and will thus not be aware that you are now falling straight down, instead of going left/right. \n\nIt can actually be quite difficult to notice as you will leave any structures that can indicate this issue very quickly. Of course, if you notice that you land much too close to some high structure from where you base jumped, you will begin to understand. For instance, falling off the floating rock, and not moving away from under neath it during that long fall. The timing was discovered because of one of the bugs in the program that sometimes [[#Functionality|makes Cueball move extremely slow]], so one jump takes more than 3s. The solution to keep moving to either side while descending is that, after the jump, you release and repress the left/right control. You will then continue moving in that direction as long as you do not jump again. If you keep holding one of these buttons, you will also keep moving laterally. When you jump up over a long distance or continue to jump hover over the landscape, you will not have this issue, since every jump reactivates the lateral movement.\n\n===Animation===\nThere have before been several interactive comics and also a few with animations. But these animations have typically been lines of flashing text or changing lights. This comic is the first with a character that is specifically changing position in animation style. Apart from this, there are also flashing text when leaving the play-area and text that appears and disappears as described in [[#Coins|Messages in Play Area]]. This also happens with the text written to begin with explaining how to play the game: ''Use the arrow keys to move'', which disappears upon touching the keys. Below are two images showing two kinds of animation of the hoverboard Cueball. The first image shows the eight standard animation that can easily be seen. They are\n*Standing still facing right (starting position)\n*Standing still facing left\n*Moving left along flat ground (lifting arms)\n*Moving right along flat ground (lifting arms)\n*Jumping while facing left looking up with hoverboard pointing down\n*Jumping while facing right looking up with hoverboard pointing down\n*Falling while facing left looking down with hoverboard pointing up\n*Falling while facing right looking down with hoverboard pointing up\n[[File:1608 Hoverboard Cueball standard animation.png]]\n\nThere are several in-between frames of Cueball turning from left to right and even more from right to left. The second image shows eight in between animations (together with four from above). Not all the positions are necessarily caught in this collage here, but there is only a limited amount of them and all last less tahn a split second. They have been sorted so it could look like Cueball has just turned to the right standing still, then jumping while turning right, then turning right while in jump, to finish the turn while falling.\n[[File:1608 Hoverboard Cueball turning animation.png]]\n\n===Image coordinates===\nAs previously noted, the comic bears considerable resemblance to [[1110: Click and Drag]]. The comic is made in much the same way, with 'drawn' images \"glued\" together to form a large \"map\", with the illusion of infinite bounds made possible through space saving techniques where blank tiles are not stored and are instead painted white. The boundary between blank squares and 'drawn' squares is made clear as any white space in the normal images has a very slight grey tint. Thus, seams between images and blank spaces can be discerned.\n\nThe tiles for the map are stored as simple PNG files in the naming scheme: X:-Y+s.png. An example from the starting tile can be seen here: https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png, with the coordinate (X, Y) coordinate (1000, 1074).\n\nEach file is 513x513 pixels in size, one pixel is reserved as overlap to ensure seamless joining of images. The image tiles names are listed as coordinates in an X - Y grid with X in the range from 928 to 1108 and Y in the range from 928 to 1112. \n\nInternally in the game, the position of the player is given for instance as (X: 512187, -Y: -549668) for the starting position. Then these numbers are divided by 512 and rounded down. This gives the coordinate of the tile that the hoverboard is currently in.\n:(X: 512187, -Y: -549668)/512 => (X, Y) = (1000.37, -[-1073,6]) => (1000, 1074) when the numbers are rounded down. \nThe bottom left corner of the first tile, would thus be (1000, 1073), and the top left corner (1000, 1074) => (512000, -549888).\n\nThe collision map is encoded in the darkness of the black. Using an image manipulation program, one can easily find the secret pathways even in the zoomed-out maps provided below by enhancing the contrast of the dark areas. Here is an example which uses the initial Play Area:\n\n{{cot|Play Area used as example}}\nUsing the Play Area as an example some of the features mentioned in this section will be explained.\nThe images used below can be seen together [[1608: Hoverboard/Screen-shots#All of Play Area|here]].\nThe hoverboard begins in (X, Y) = [https://xkcd.com/1608/1000:-1074+s.png (1000, 1074)]. \nBut even while staying within the Play Area, defined as the area where you will not be told to [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ae/Return_to_the_play_area.PNG Return to the Play Area], you can see all or part of twenty images. \nYou can move one image left and right of the starting point before reaching the walls, and one image up without getting too high. But from there you can see part of the images one step further left, right and up, and from the starting level you can see part of the black images below as well.\nThis makes it a five times four images rectangle.\nThis first example shows a full-size image combined from these twenty images that make up the play area starting in the top left corner with image [https://xkcd.com/1608/998:-1076+s.png (998, 1076)] and finishing down the right corner with image [https://xkcd.com/1608/1002:-1073+s.png (1002, 1073)]. \nHere are only the images themselves, nothing with the game parts, i.e. coins and hoverboard Cueball: [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/eb/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Images_Only.png Play Area Full Size Images Only].\n\nThe next example shows both where the tiles are and what you see to begin with, i.e. the starting view when loading the comic to begin with. Still without any in game details.\nHere the tiles are lines out with green and the view frame is in red. From this it can be seen that the view is somewhat larger than a single image.\nMore precisely the view is 1.43 times longer and 1.34 higher than a tile giving an area almost twice as big (1.93 times), but only going about one-third of a tile length in each direction: [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7b/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Tiles_and_View.png Play Area Full Size Tiles and View].\nThis third example shows the game version, with coins and hoverboard, but still the hole Play Area and hence also the read viewing square.\n\nThis is included to indicate which coins can be seen to begin with and also how the view is centered around Cueball and the hoverboard.\nCueballs center is also the center of the view. His center is defined as the line of his body in the X direction and just above his hands in the Y direction.\nThe view is twelve times as high and thirty times as wide as the Cueball on hoverboard (and compared to a tile these numbers are 9.4 and 20.8 times).[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/8b/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Coins_Hoverboard_and_View.png Play Area Full Size Coins Hoverboard and View].\n\nThe last and fourth example is the same as above, but again with the green tiles.\nThis to indicate the size of a tile compared to Cueball\nIt also shows that although there are twelve coins in the starting view, the one at the top left is clearly in the image above, and the three others at the top are grazing the top edge of the image: [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a3/1680_Play_Area_Full_Size_Coins_Hoverboard_Tiles_and_View.png Play Area Full Size Coins Hoverboard Tiles and View].\n{{cob}}\n\n===Cheats===\n[[File:1608_MetroidXK.png|500px|thumb|right]]\nA standalone cross-platform [https://github.com/AMDmi3/hoverboard-sdl open-source] remake of this comic is available.

You can find more information [https://web.archive.org/web/20170223172620/http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=113083&start=120#p3913102 here] and download it [https://www.xeloh.com/Releases#MetroidXK here].\n\nAside from the obvious ability to move out of bounds in the game, there are some more obscure hidden features which can't be enabled through normal gameplay:\n\n'''Modes''' are activated by opening the Javascript Console (F12 [Or Command-Alt-I in most browsers under Mac OS X] to open Developer Tools, then Console tab) and writing corresponding commands.<br>\n'''Click to expand:'''\n\n*'''Gandalf Mode:''' ''i.am.gandalf = true'' - jumps and runs further. displays a white Gandalf hat that works well in places where the avatar can't be seen.\n\n*'''Speedhack:''' ''explorer.opts.speed= *Value*'' - Speed hacking, with 1 = normal speed\n\n*'''Jump Hack:''' '' explorer.opts.jumpForce= -*Value*'' - Jump hacking, with -10 = normal jump (positive values cause the hoverboard guy to move down when jumping)\n\n*'''Mewtwo mode:''' ''mewtwo = true'' - disables gravity\n\n*'''Noclip mode:''' ''noclip = true'' - player is able to move around the map without collision. Combine with Gandalf and Mewtwo modes for free easy map traversal.\n\n*'''Goggles mode:''' ''ze.goggles()'' - displays a small window showing area around the player in a pixelated manner. The goggles indicate collision boundaries (where the player touches the world) in cyan lines. Black pixels that are passable (such as other characters or text) will be highlighted red (allowing secret passages to be discovered).\n\n*'''Position Tracking:''' ''explorer.pos'' - Returns the player location to the console. Can be used to track position and test to ensure you are still moving. Must be re-entered to compare positioning.\n\n*'''Position Setting:''' ''explorer.pos.x = *Value* or explorer.pos.y = *Value*'' - Can be used to manually set a position within the world. The start is at x: 512106, y: -549612. The left terrain bound is at x: 475210, y: -553711. The right terrain bound is at x: 567281, y: -549712. Mewtwo and Noclip modes are necessary for exploring in this way.\n\n* '''All the above:''' ''explorer.opts'' - Contains all the game's parameters. You can directly mess with ''gravity'', collision (''disableCollision''), jump force (''jumpForce'') and speed (''maxSpeed''), among others. Run ''Object.keys(explorer.opts)'' to list all available parameters you can tweak.\n\n* '''List all coins:''' ''explorer.objects'' - Array containing the position of the 169 coins of the game.\n\n* '''Disable tilt input:''' ''getEventListeners(window)['deviceorientation'][0].remove()'' - on Macs with motion sensor, disables tilt input which causes problems controlling the avatar\n\n* '''Getting All Coins:''' To instantly get all coins, input the code below into the console window. Does not use standard formatting of [i] to avoid conflicts with i.am.gandalf\n{{cot|View hacks}}\n    for (var T = 0; T < explorer.objects.length; T++) {\n        explorer.objects[T].got = true;\n    }\n\nTo teleport to the next coin every time you press the left or right arrow:\n\n    var T = 0;\n    document.onkeydown = function(event){\n      if (event.keyCode == 37) { T = T-1 }\n      else if (event.keyCode == 39) { T = T+1 }\n      else { return }\n      T = T % explorer.objects.length;\n      var coin = explorer.objects[T];\n      explorer.pos.x = coin.x1;
