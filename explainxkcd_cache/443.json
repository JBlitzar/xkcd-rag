He then points out that {{w|Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy}} is another vine-like plant with 3 green leaves that also grows near camping areas - but causes skin rashes. His girlfriend is into {{w|Bondage (BDSM)|light bondage}} (being tied up or tying up another for erotic purposes), yet the area around their tent was too dark to differentiate between the two vines when they went looking for some impromptu rope. \n\nThe implication: Either Randall, his girlfriend, or both spent some time that night wrapped in poison ivy. The resulting painful rashes were likely blamed on the one who harvested the wrong plant, and the relationship suffered.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that many modern tents are self-supporting and no longer require rope to put up. Had there been tent rope on hand, there would be no need to look for vines.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Picture of a green, five-leafed plant:]\n:Virginia creeper: Vines useful as impromptu rope\n\n:[Picture of a green, 3-leafed plant:]\n:Poison ivy: Grows in same habitat as Virginia creeper\n\n:[A woman with long hair standing:]\n:Girlfriend: Into light bondage\n\n:[A dark image of a tree, the top of which extends above the panel, with light green vines near the base of the tree trunk:]\n:Area around campsite: Too dark to see\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Relationship after camping trip: Strained\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
