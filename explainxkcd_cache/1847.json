I looked up the Academy, and it says on their MySpace page that their journal is peer-viewed and downloaded biannually.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic alludes to the growing industry in {{w|Predatory open access publishing|disreputable academic journals}}, many of whom accept articles of dubious merit for publication without rigorous peer review upon payment of a fee.  In an attempt to sound legitimate (and thus attract submissions), many such publishers publish journals whose names sound intentionally similar to (if not identical to) established titles.  Here, the ''National Academy of Proceedings'' is a meaningless title that sounds similar to the highly regarded academic title {{w|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA''}}.\n\nThe title text implies that this (at present) fictional journal has a dubious online presence in the faded internet site {{w|Myspace|MySpace}}, where the publishers make claims that may be true but are misleading: \"peer-viewed\" sounds similar to \"{{w|peer review|peer-reviewed}}\", the community-led process of establishing a paper's scientific integrity prior to publication, but in fact means only that scientists have viewed the content (as [[Cueball]] is now).  Likewise, some journals might be \"published biannually\", whereas \"downloaded biannually\" implies that the journal is ''read'' only twice each year. Single articles in high-profile journals such as ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' would expect to receive [http://palgrave.nature.com/nchem/journal/v7/n5/nchem.2243/metrics hundreds to thousands] of views in their first year of publication.  The [[Black Hat|fictional journal publisher]] no doubt hopes that an inexperienced scientist may mistake these claims for meaningful statements of authority, and thus submit a paper (and eventually pay a fee for its publication).  \n\n''The National Academy of Proceedings'' in fact sets itself apart from certain predatory journals by ensuring that the claims on its website are in fact factually accurate (if phrased to mislead article authors, particularly those with English as an additional language); some journals are [http://www.nature.com/news/predatory-journals-recruit-fake-editor-1.21662 openly dishonest] on their websites.\n\nRandall also judges academic content based on superficial details in comic [[1301: File Extensions]], where he focuses on how the information is formatted (in particular if it is in TeX or with the TeX rendering-style of a scientific publication). Similarly, in [[906: Advertising Discovery]], Randall muses on how we automatically trust anything formatted in Wikipedia style. (This was later proven in a scientific study.<ref>No it wasn't. But weren't you inclined to believe it just because of the little blue \"[1]\"?</ref>) And on a different note, prestigious-sounding but meaningless names also appear in the title text for [[1068: Swiftkey|1068]], where {{w|SwiftKey}} suggests the phrase \"Massachusetts Institute of America\" to Randall.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is standing behind Cueball who is sitting at a computer desk using a laptop.]\n:Megan: Are you sure this study is legit?\n:Cueball: Sure, it says it was accepted for publication.\n:Megan: Where?\n:Cueball: Hmm... ''The National Academy of Proceedings''.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:If something is formatted like a serious scientific paper, it can take me a while to realize it isn't one.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Science]]"
