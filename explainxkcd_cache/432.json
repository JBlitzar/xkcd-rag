He then proceeds to silently scorn the person once they give him any kind of reassurance.\n\nIn Journal 2, however, [[Danish]] sees through his ruse. She counteracts it by proving that she understands him, and attempts to resign him to the fact that he will never see her again, thus robbing him of the satisfaction of a proper social connection. She leaves, taking his hat in the process. Initially stunned, in Journal 3 he at last regained his hat, the emblem of his personality and attitude, leaving him with the higher ground.\n\nNow, precipitously, Black Hat has found himself to be in love with Danish, even though this counters his whole worldview. He even took off his precious hat. As stated in the title text, he somehow believed that he was immune to such feelings. What is he to do? And why is he in love? And how?\n\nThe title text indicates that Black Hat had previously believed that his hat signified, or even caused, immunity from emotional sensitivity (usually depicted in his [[classhole]] behavior). The meaning of Black Hat's hat is not specified, but it is clearly something important to him. More evidence of the hat's adumbrative meaning can be seen in [[455: Hats]].\n\nThe whole \"[[:Category:Journal|Journal]]\" story is:\n*[[374: Journal]]\n*[[377: Journal 2]]\n*[[405: Journal 3]]\n*[[432: Journal 4]]\n*[[433: Journal 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat sits slumped over on a bench, holding his hat in one hand, displaying his thin hair, while resting his cheek on his other arm.]\n:Black Hat: S<big>i</big>GH\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Journal|04]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Journal]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]] <!-- i -->"
