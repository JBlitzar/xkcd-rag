This one is charted as a timeline, whereas 715 was charted as line graphs.\nIt is a list of things predicted or announced by anyone at any time (the ones you see on Google search using \"by the year...\" or similar statements).\n\n\"2101 - War Was Beginning\" is a reference to the opening narration of video game ''Zero Wing''; the same narration is famous for the internet meme \"{{w|All your base are belong to us}}\". As there are not any other out and out references in the comic, and the rest are actually results that you can find using Randall's methods, \"War Was Beginning\" was probably the only thing he got when he googled 2101 as well.\n\nCertain events in this comic, e.g., \"Social Security stops running surplus\", are repeated multiple times. Also, certain bizarre events, like \"Apocalypse occurs\", or \"Flying cars reach market\", happen before rather plausible things, like \"'Big one' hits California\". Certain events, like \"Japan is a robot-only country\" or \"Gillette introduces 14-blade razor\" may be related to the recurring theme [[605: Extrapolating]].\n\nAccording to [https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.pdf some official projections], (non Hispanic) {{w|White people}} will no longer be the majority in the United States by 2045 due to low birth rates and high rates of immigration. The title text is Randall's statement that, for both the US and Great Britain, there are so many sources that mention this, for any year he cared to search for and many using more far more doubtful sources (if any), that he decided that it was not worth flooding the chart with all these spurious repetitions, even though he did include other less prolific recurring themes.\n\nThis comic has similar features to [[1413: Suddenly Popular]], [[1093: Forget]], and [[891: Movie Ages]].\n\n==The predictions==\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Prediction\n! Further Details\n! Outcome\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 2012\n| World population\n| Ever since the advent of modern medicine and the more efficient agricultural processes developed since the Industrial Revolution, the human population had been growing at an unprecedented rate. This has caused some people to {{w|Human overpopulation|worry about overpopulation}}, which would cause a scarcity of resources and overcrowding, and propose various solutions, most of which involve some form of eugenics. 7 billion is a landmark number because it is a multiple of 1 billion.\n| Close; Earth reached 7 billion in late 2011.\n|-\n| Flying cars\n| For decades, flying cars have been a staple of futuristic sci-fi and technological predictions. So far very few of these predictions, which to tend to hover around 5–10 years from whatever the current date is, have come true.\n| Too early; a flying car designed for consumer use was [https://www.suasnews.com/2021/04/announcing-aska-the-electric-take-off-and-landing-flying-car-for-consumers first demonstrated in July 2021] , but has yet to go into production. You could argue that helicopters count as flying cars, but these are not affordable{{citation needed}} and hence not widely used by the general public.\n|-\n| Canada cuts greenhouse emissions\n| Currently, the Earth is experiencing an unprecedented period of warming we call global warming, caused in part by greenhouse emissions, which are gases that help trap heat in the atmosphere. Countries have repeatedly gotten together and promised to stop emitting greenhouse gases, but so far they have failed to meet their targets.\n| False. Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in late 2011, and its emissions in 2012 were 18% ''above'' 1990 levels (though its population had grown 26% and its GDP had grown 67% in that period).\n|-\n| Apocalypse occurs\n| The end of a cycle of the Mayan calendar on December 22, 2012 has been used in popular culture as a basis for predicting the end of the world. Amongst other things, this included the film '2012'. Some people took this rather more seriously, and actually believed that the world would end on this date. \n| False.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 2013\n| National debt paid off\n| For years, the subject of national debt (in the USA) has been a political point of contention.  While both parties theoretically support reducing the debt or paying it off entirely, Democrats are more willing to spend to pull the country out of recessions in the economy and Republicans to cut taxes. The last time that spending did not exceed revenue begin under Clinton, a Democrat, and ended after George W. Bush, a Republican, said that this amounted to taxpayers being \"overcharged\" and taxes were lowered, followed by the Great Recession.  Clinton at one point proposed [https://money.cnn.com/1999/06/28/economy/clinton/ paying off the debt by 2015].\n| False.\n|-\n| Microchipping all Americans\n| Microchips are small computer chips, typically embedded in pets in case they get lost, that contain information about the pet. Some, more paranoid, people worry about the government microchipping everyone in an effort to monitor their activities.\n| False, although voluntary RFID implants do exist.\n|-\n| Homelessness ended in MA\n| In 2008, the Commission To End Homelessness in Massachusetts, under Governor Deval Patrick, proposed a plan to all but eliminate homelessness over the next five years (hence the 2013 end-date on the comic).\n| False.\n|-\n| Health care reform law repealed\n| A health care reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010. Ever since, many Republicans have tried (in vain) to repeal it, disliking the idea that government should provide and require healthcare. However, President [[Joe Biden]] has stated to restore Obamacare.\n| Too early; almost repealed in 2017.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2014\n| US leaves Afghanistan\n| After the {{w|September 11 attacks|terrorist attack}} on the {{w|World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center}} (WTC) in New York on September 11, 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan, due to the Taliban allegedly hosting al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization behind the attacks. The war has gone on since then, with the public growing increasingly tired of it. Public support then favoured a withdrawal, but for military and logistical reasons, the government could not simply move all the US troops in Afghanistan to their home. Therefore, the government promised to eventually withdraw all troops, initially planned to do so by the end of 2014.\n| Too early; the remaining US troops [https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/afghanistan-afghan-troops-struggle-to-replace-americans-at-key-bagram-air-base-2480356 left Afghanistan in June 2021.]\n|-\n| GNU/Linux dominant OS\n| An operating system, or OS, is the software that forms the structure in which applications on you computer function. Some typical OSs include Mac OS X, Windows 10, and Linux. The first two of those three are commercial products, sold as a copy by a company. The last is an open-source OS, one that anyone can download and modify free. Typically, open-source software is used by a small number of socially conscious people. \n| False, although Linux-based Android dominated phones since 2011.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2015\n| New Horizon reaches Pluto\n| The New Horizon spacecraft is a U.S. space mission designed to go to Pluto and take photographs, collect samples, etc. \n| True. [https://pluto.jhuapl.edu It reached Pluto on July 14, 2015].\n|-\n| Healthcare law causes hyperinflation\n| The National Inflation Association warned that the [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthcare-bill-to-cause-us-hyperinflation-by-2015-88711032.html healthcare bill would cause U.S. hyperinflation by 2015.]\n| False.\n|-\n| Millennium development goals achieved\n| {{w|Millennium Development Goals}}\n| False.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2016\n| Baby boomers begin turning 65\n| {{w|Baby boomers}} are individuals conceived in the years following World War Two, roughly defined as those born from 1946-1959. This isn't so much a prediction as basic math; if you were born in 1946, you turned 65 in 2011.\n| True.\n|-\n| Android takes 38%/45% of market share\n| {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}} is a popular operating system for smartphones and tablets, created by Google. Market share is the percentage of all devices that use the product, in this case the Android operating system. These entries together are humorous because they cannot both happen at the same time.\n| Too late; passed these marks in 2010. {{w|Android OS}}'s [https://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp market share was already 84.4% as of the third quarter of 2014,] showing that both estimates were overly conservative.\n|-\n| Windows phone overtakes iOS\n| {{w|iOS}} is the operating system used by Apple iPhones. At the time of the comic, Apple's mobile OS is much more popular than Microsoft's. The article Randall found predicts that the tables will turn. However, Windows Phone was discontinued in 2017, with support for the last version (Windows Phone 10) ending on December 10, 2019.\n| False.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\"| 2017\n| China completes lunar mission\n| The {{w|Chinese space program}} has plans for extraterrestrial exploration, including a manned mission to the Moon.\nAlready having had success (prior to the comic) with lunar orbiters from 2007 onwards, the first lunar lander was 14 December 2013. The mission that the comic describes, however, is the first sample-return mission that returned to Earth 16 December 2020 (later than this prediction).\n| Too early.\n|-\n| Social Security stops running surplus\n| The first of many predictions about the United States {{w|Social Security (United States)|Social Security}} trust fund program, all predicting its decline due to a variety of factors.\n| Too early. Occurred in 2021.\n|-\n| US budget balanced\n| The {{w|United States federal budget}} outlines how much the US government spends on what in a given fiscal year. The budget is not required to be balanced, and so often more money is spent than is earned in revenue, causing the national debt to rise.\n| False. Still pretty negative.\n|-\n| Newspapers become obsolete and die out\n| The increasing popularity of social media and online news has caused a steady decline in the popularity of print media.\n| False. Though newspapers (especially printed ones) are in decline, they are certainly not obsolete as of 2017, or {{CURRENTYEAR}}, for that matter.\n|-\n| Cosmetic surgery doubles\n| {{w|Cosmetic Surgery}}\n| False. According to the ASPS (American Society of Plastic Surgeons), 1.6 million cosmetic surgeries were performed in 2011, while 1.8 million were performed in 2017, an increase of only 0.2 million.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2018\n| Social Security stops running surplus\n| {{w|Social Security (United States)|Social Security}} again.\n| Still too early.\n|-\n| Jesus returns to Earth\n| A number of Christians have attempted to predict the return of Christ (a.k.a. the {{w|second coming}} or the rapture) using clues from The Bible, even though the Bible and other religious texts says that \"no man can know the date\" and that it would be within the lifetime of some who witnessed Jesus's first appearance. Several predicted dates have come and gone.\n| False.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2019\n| Social Security stops running surplus\n| {{w|Social Security (United States)|Social Security}} again.\n| Still too early.\n|-\n| Every baby has genes mapped at birth\n| {{w|Gene Mapping}}\n| False.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2020\n| Solar power becomes cheaper than fossil fuels\n| Scientists estimate that more than half of the {{w|fossil fuels}} in existence have already been found and that fossil fuel production will begin to decline due to the scarcity, causing prices to increase. At the same time, improvements in {{w|Solar Power|solar technology}} are causing the prices for solar energy to steadily decrease.\n| True, though only in {{w|Cost of electricity by source#Recent_global_studies|certain cases}}.\n|-\n| Keyboards and mice become obsolete\n| {{w|Computer input device|Computer input devices}} are beginning to adopt other inputs, such as trackpads, voice commands, touch screens, and eye tracking. While touch screens in particular are gaining widespread use with the rise of smartphones and tablets, as of 2022 desktop computers that use mice are still fairly common. And while voice-to-text has greatly improved, it still doesn't have the accuracy to replace typing. None of the other text inputs are as fast as a keyboard, and none are suitable for writing program code.\n| False. While touchscreen devices ''are'' increasingly common, desktop computers are still very much in use. Mice continue to be used alongside touchscreens and trackpads, and keyboards remain the dominant method of writing on computers. \n|-\n| New Tappan Zee bridge constructed\n| A {{w|Tappan_Zee_Bridge#Replacement_bridge|replacement bridge}} was announced in 2008.\n| Too late; completed in 2017.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 2021\n| US debt reaches 97% of GDP\n| {{w|US Debt}}\n| Too late; reached in 2011.\n|-\n| US unemployment falls to 2.8%\n| {{w|Unemployment in the United States}}\n| False: because of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment has actually ''increased''.\n|-\n| Restored caliphate unifies Middle East\n| A {{w|caliphate}} is a form of {{w|Islam|Islamic}} theocracy, centred around a Caliph, or successor to the prophet {{w|Muhammad}}. This prediction foreshadows the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which attempted but failed to create a caliphate in the Levant.\n| False.\n|-\n| Lake Mead evaporates\n| Formed by the {{w|Hoover Dam}} on the {{w|Colorado River}}, {{w|Lake Mead}} is the largest reservoir in the United States (measured by maximum capacity). It hasn't reached its capacity since 1983, due to drought and increased demand for water. This is linked to {{w|global warming}}.\n| False, although water levels continue to fall.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2022\n| Kilimanjaro snow-free\n| At 5,895 metres, {{w|Kilimanjaro}} is the highest mountain in {{w|Africa}}, and the highest free-standing mountain in the world.
