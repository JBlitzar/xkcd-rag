''Spore'' starts you off as a cell, and when you become smart enough, you leave the water for land and start growing. To begin with, the scale of your interest is thus very small as you are only concerned with your spot of water. During the next two stages, the scale grows to being the entire continent. Once you start building cities, you get to view the entire planet. The last stage (and scale) is space, where you get to first travel through your own solar system, then the entire galaxy.\n\nCueball runs into a common gamer's problem, that being an inability (or unwillingness) to purchase a game on its release date due to the initial price. Since Cueball can't yet afford ''Spore'', he instead is recreating the experience by playing older games, starting off with small scale games. In the comic, Cueball had just beaten the game ''{{w|Populous}}'', which is on a planet scale, so now he can go on to the interstellar scale with the game ''{{w|Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri|Alpha Centauri}}''.\n\nThe following three games could, for instance, have been played before the ones mentioned: ''{{w|SimAnt}}'' (ant scale), then moving up to ''{{w|The Sims}}'' (human scale), and then proceeding with ''{{w|SimCity}}'' (city scale). \n\nThe title text refers to the game not being able to run on the Mac using a {{w|GMA 950}}, which is a type of Intel integrated graphics processor. It was first supported in OSX 10.4. It lacked hardware support for vertex shader 2.0, which some games required.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sitting at computer desk, surrounded by game boxes.]\n:Cueball: Sweet, beat ''Populous''. Now, on to ''Alpha Centauri''.\n:Until I can afford ''Spore'', I'm just playing through all my old games in order of scale.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Video games]]"
