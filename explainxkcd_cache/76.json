However, she recognizes that what she has should be enough, and resolves to stop worrying. Hairy responds to this by saying that he doesn't even like her, recognizing that it's relatively poor timing to say so after her expression of love (albeit a rather ambivalent one).\n\nThe title text is a sad-face emoticon, representing either Megan's sadness about his dislike of her, his (possibly disingenuous) sympathy for her, or the narrator's recognition that he's depicted a sad situation.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairy and Megan are talking]\n:Megan: I worry that I'm just with you because it's familiar. Of course no one else compares. I've known you for so long that I'd have to spend years with someone to build up this kind of connection and I daren't let you go of you long enough to let that happen.\n:Megan: But I guess this is really all I can ask for. I'm happy with you; I should stop worrying.\n:[Megan takes Hairy's hand.]\n:Hairy: This is probably a bad time to bring this up, but I don't actually like you.\n\n==Trivia==\nSimilar to [[62: Valentine - Karnaugh]] and [[63: Valentine - Heart]], until 2023-08-03 or before, the image for this comic was rotated 90 degrees clockwise due to the EXIF metadata.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
