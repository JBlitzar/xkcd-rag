It makes me feel really ironic.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic presents a snapshot of an argument between [[Black Hat]] and [[Cueball]]. Black Hat states that it's ironic how Cueball understands the definition of irony, yet Black Hat is happy while Cueball is not. Cueball is upset because Black Hat is purposely misusing the term \"ironic\", likely after Cueball had previously corrected him on his use of the word.\n\n{{w|Irony}} is a broad concept that is very often the subject of confusion and debate, especially concerning whether something is \"really\" irony. In this comic, [[Black Hat]] is probably referencing {{w|Irony#Situational irony|situational irony}}, which occurs when there is a sharp contrast between the expected and actual results of a situation, often in a humorous way or one that includes some sort of contradiction. For example, {{w|Cane toads in Australia|cane toads}} were introduced to Australia to control the native cane beetle, a pest to farmers. Ironically, the toads have caused massive ecological damage and become a pest themselves, and have even failed to control the cane beetles. That someone who understands what irony is would be unhappy while someone who doesn't would be happy is ''not'' an example of irony. Since Black Hat is trying to irritate Cueball, he is intentionally misusing the word \"ironic\".\n\nIrony can have other meanings besides situational irony. Verbal irony (which is related to sarcasm) refers to a contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning. Dramatic irony is a device in fiction in which the consumer of a work is aware of information that is unknown to a character in the narrative. The adjective \"ironic\" is often used colloquially to mean strange, interesting, unexpected, or funny based on some subversion of expectations. The use of the word in these ways is often what prompts conversations and arguments about what really is or isn't ironic.\n\nWhat could be going on is that Cueball was trying to correct Black Hat's misuse of the word irony, in order to make him feel bad about misusing it. However, Black Hat being the [[classhole]] he is, could have decided to take advantage of it, and misuse it '''again''', to make Cueball angry again.\n\nIn the title text Black Hat once again misuses the word ''ironic'', this time in an even more absurd way. It is unknown what Black Hat means when he says Cueball's glaring makes him feel \"ironic\", as this is a totally spurious use of the word, and one which is probably not intended to actually mean anything and is only done to annoy Cueball further.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Cueball are walking together, with Black Hat walking behind Cueball with his arms out and palms up. Cueball is visibly upset, as evidenced by the squiggle floating above his head and his balled up fists.]\n:Black Hat: It's ironic how '''''you''''' know the definition of irony, yet '''''I'm''''' the one in this conversation who's happy.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
