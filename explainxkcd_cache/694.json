The world of Windows will fade any moment now!\n}}\n==Explanation==\nThis comic uses the word \"retro\" as a reference to {{w|Retro|retro style}} and \"virus\" as a reference to {{w|Computer virus|computer viruses}}. This {{w|portmanteau}} is also a double entendre for a {{w|retrovirus}}, which is a type of actual biological virus which injects its genetic code into a cell and may wait several cell generations before triggering and multiplying.\n\n[[Cueball]] finds himself needing to clean a virus off his {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}} machine. Unfortunately, the {{w|Windows Registry|registry}} editor (regedit), a key tool in manipulating Windows, is affected. A coworker comes over and mentions that it has been a while since he has worried about cleaning viruses in the {{w|Windows API#Versions|Win32 API}}.\n\nCueball responds that {{w|Windows XP}} operating system is still the most popular (which it [http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=11&qpcustomb=0&qpsp=2009&qpnp=4&qptimeframe=Y was] in 2010, and remained until mid-2012), but is drowned out by another coworker ([[Ponytail]]) who exclaims that it is as if they are back in 2003. Back then, {{w|Windows XP}} machines were the standard in many places, and were far more often targeted by viruses than other systems, e.g. {{w|Linux}}, {{w|Mac OS X}}, etc.\n\nIn the final panel, Cueball's coworkers continue to make fun of him by referencing things that were important back in 2003 like {{w|Howard Dean}}, {{w|Friendster}} or {{w|Kazaa}}. Such things have since fallen largely out of prominence.\n\nThe title text is a reference to the {{w|Desktop Linux#Year of Desktop Linux|year of Linux on the desktop}}, which is an expectation that in an upcoming year, Linux will make a large breakthrough and be widely adopted by businesses and personal users. The expectation has been around since about 2000, however, and has not exactly happened (although non-desktop devices running {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}}, a Linux-based OS, are now very common). If it were to happen, the large market share enjoyed by Windows OSes would fade away.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is using a computer.]\n:Cueball: Argh, this is frustrating.\n:Friend (off-panel): What?\n\n:Cueball: This Windows box has a virus and I can't get RegEdit to-\n:Friend (off-panel): Haha, cleaning viruses? Man, what a blast from the past!\n\n:Friend: Check it out! Dude's cleaning Win32 viruses! Remember that?\n:Ponytail (off-panel): It's like we're back in 2003!\n:Cueball (small): Hey, XP's still the most-\n\n:Friend: Did you get the virus from Kazaa?\n:Ponytail (with laptop): Guess what I just read on Howard Dean's Friendster!?\n:Cueball (head in hands): Guys...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
