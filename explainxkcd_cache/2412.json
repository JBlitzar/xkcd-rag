It follows directly from the previous release in the same week [[2411: 1/10,000th Scale World]] and it was followed less than two weeks later by [[2417: 1/1,000th Scale World]]. [[Randall]] has another seemingly complete {{w|scale model}} of {{w|Earth}}, this time at a smaller {{w|Scale (ratio)|scale}} of 1:100,000 – that is, 1 meter in this scale world represents 100,000 meters in the real world. (This is one tenth the size of his first 1/Xth Scale World comic, [[2411: 1/10,000th Scale World]]. Again, real-world features and phenomena are depicted at scale and labeled with warnings. Details on the various remarks are in the [[#Table|table]] below.\n\nThe title text states that the floor should be slightly curved. In fact, given that the model in the comic is about 10 meters long, it represents about 1000 km of Earth, which spans about 9 degrees of a great circle. Therefore, if the model wasn't larger than the part shown in the panel, its edges would have a very noticeable slope of 4.5 degrees. What's more, the note that artificial gravity hasn't been invented reveals that the scale worlds are nothing more than a mundane model, rather than some supernatural phenomenon that allows giants to roam about the surface of the Earth. Instead, intoxicating gas is added to the air to make people feel like the ground is curving away.\n\nCurved floors were also mentioned in [[2632: Greatest Scientist]].\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rule\n!Explanation\n!Notes\n|-\n|Our aurora are probably non-toxic but please stop trying to taste them\n|{{w|Aurora|Auroras}} are colorful discharges of light in the ionosphere, roughly 50-1000 km (30-600 mi) above the Earth's surface, or 50 cm-10 m (1.5-30 ft) in this scale model. The specific aurora in the image is now temptingly at head height, and presumably looks a lot like cotton candy or other inviting foodstuffs.\n| The plural of \"{{w|aurora}}\" should actually be \"auroras\" or \"aurorae\".\n|-\n|No breaking off pieces of the ice caps to put in your drink\n|An ice cap is a mass of ice that covers less than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) of land area. At about 2-3 km thickness in real world, 1/100,000 scaled ice caps have a 2-3 cm (about 1 inch) thickness, which is a convenient size to put in drinks.\n|Breaking off pieces of somebody's models is rude.{{citation needed}} In addition, removing pieces of ice caps would affect the climate of the scale world.\n|-\n|Warning: Limited cell network coverage above the ionosphere, crouch down to get more bars\n|The ionosphere reflects radio signals, including those used by cellphones. The ionosphere would be at around 50 cm-10 m (1.5-30 ft) in the scale world, so visitors would need to place their phones below it to receive cellphone signals.\n|Usually, people try to get as high as possible to get better cell coverage, so this is a comic twist to that. As another comic twist, It's unlikely that ordinary cellphones would respond to the very short radio frequencies being transmitted by cell towers in this scale model.\n|-\n|Do not step on Mt. Everest\n|Mt. Everest, the highest peak on Earth at 8849 m (29,032 ft), is about 9 cm (3.5 in) tall at 1:100,000 scale.\n|Mt. Everest would probably be extremely sharp and hurt or puncture your foot.\n|-\n|Caution! Ocean floor slippery when wet\n|The average depth of the ocean is about 3.7 km (2.3 mi), which would come out to 3.7 cm (1.5 in) in this world. This amount of liquid would cause more of a 'slippery surface' than a 'water region'.\n|The ocean floor is generally wet.{{citation needed}}\n|-\n|Wear sunscreen; the ozone layer only protects you below the knees.\n|The ozone layer is a layer of the Earth's stratosphere that shields the Earth from the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. It is approximately 15-35 km (9-22 mi) above Earth, or 15-35 cm (5.7-14 in) in this scaled world, which is below knee height. To protect themselves from UV rays, visitors would need sunscreen on exposed parts of their body above that level.\n|Visitors may also choose to wear sunscreen on the exposed parts of their body below the ozone layer as well. This is where most people actually do it.\n|-\n|Beware of chest-level meteors\n|Meteors happen when meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere and start to burn up. This typically occurs in the mesosphere at altitudes from 76 to 100 km (250,000 to 330,000 ft). In the scale world, meteors would occur at 76 to 100 centimeters, around chest height.\n|Above the atmosphere, meteoroids typically travel at tens of thousands of km/h (mph), which at this scale would work out to 20-70 cm/s (8-30 in/s). They're usually no larger than a meter (3 ft), but a very large one might be up to 100 m (300 ft), which in this world would be about 1 mm (1/25 inch). This would sting if it hit a visitor in the eye, which is another reason that safety glasses (see below) might be a good idea.\n|-\n| -100°C mesopause vest recommended\n|The mesopause is the boundary in the earth's atmosphere between the mesosphere and the thermosphere. Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong radiative cooling from carbon dioxide, it is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100 °C (-148 °F).\n|Without protection, visitors would succumb to hypothermia, in addition to extreme discomfort, due to the extremely low temperature.\n|-\n|If Lake Tahoe or the Dead Sea dries up, refill them with this 5oz wine glass\n|Five ounces, times 100,000<sup>3</sup> (because this is volume, so the linear scale factor applies to each of three dimensions), would be about 150 cubic kilometers, which is the approximate volume of {{w|Lake Tahoe}}; the {{w|Dead Sea}} is recently about 115 cubic kilometers, though it used to be somewhat larger.\n|Five fluid ounces (US customary) is a tad below 148 cubic centimeters, or milliliters. (Elsewhere, if used, it is actually nearer 142cc.) Modern wine glasses may actually hold 450ml (filled to the brim), but 150ml is typical of a late 19thC antique glass or a modern 'serving' level that is more tasteful/economic than an overgenerous 'drown your sorrows' one. The reason Randall gives this rule is because the Dead Sea is drying up and Lake Tahoe has experienced recent low water levels due to drought, making this pertinent.\n|-\n|Safety glasses required for protection from reentering spacecraft\n|It is at approximately head height in this model that de-orbiting spacecraft are at their fastest, depending upon where their decayed or departed original was. At scale, they'd probably equate to a metalworking fragment, perhaps more dangerous in quantity than individually.\n|We also tend to know about satellites and fairings returning to Earth and most (unless intended to) won't significantly survive. Meteoroids (see above) are hard to spot in space unless particularly big, may only be detected when spotted burning up, may be significantly denser/less fragile, and could be traveling five times faster. General head protection may be advised, just in case.\n|-\n|Do not anger the sprites\n| {{w|Sprite (lightning)|Sprites}} are poorly understood electrical phenomena in the upper atmosphere. They are enormous but very short-lived.\n| Sprites are also a name given to a form of forest spirit known for mischievous and sometimes harmful behavior. In some fairy tales, a warning would be given to not anger the spirits in case of grave repercussions.\n|-\n|Please stop digging through the Moho. Staff are tired of cleaning up large igneous provinces.\n|Short for the {{w|Mohorovičić discontinuity}}, and not to be confused with [[1244|Kerbal]] [[1356|Space]] [[2204|Program's]] [https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Moho planet of the same name], the Moho is the boundary surface separating the Earth's crust from the mantle. It can be found at a depth of about 10 km (6-7 mi) under the ocean bed, and about 40-50 km (24-30 mi) under the continents.\n|In Randall's 1/100,000th scale world, this would be approximately 10 cm (4 in) or 40 cm (16 in) respectively, making the Moho easily accessible via digging. This would get messy and dangerous lava all over the place and create {{w|Large igneous province|large igneous provinces}}, which have been linked with mass extinctions. \"Large igneous provinces\" may be a reference to [[2061: Tectonics Game]], where making them is \"the worst.\"\n|-\n|ISS (14 feet up) Returns every 90 minutes - Hit it with a nerf dart, win a prize!\n|The {{w|International Space Station}} is the largest human-made object in space and orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes. Its average altitude is about 400 km (250 mi), or about 14 ft (4 m) in this comic's scale. \n|This idea of treating modern research as a toy is in the same general panel area as the weather balloon smacking from the previous comic, except instead of a rule preventing people from doing so, this time the visitor is being incentivised to attempt it, similarly to a {{w|carnival game}}.  Hitting the ISS with a nerf dart in this scaled world would have a potentially devastating effect on the ISS; however, at this scale, the ISS would be about a millimeter across, so that hitting it so far above your head as it goes by would be very difficult. Rather like a target in a typical carnival-game, the scale ISS is moving past at a moderate speed, about three inches per second (7.7 cm/s), so you can have several attempts before it's entirely out of range till its next orbit.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[At the top of the image, inside the panel, a large title is floating in the air.]\n:RULES\n:For visitors to my 1/100,000th scale world\n:1 meter = 100 km, 1 ft=100,000ft≈20 miles\n\n:[Each of the following rules is written near a character or point of interest on the map.]\n\n:[Dark-colored aurorae are floating in the air.]\n:Our aurora are probably non-toxic but please stop trying to taste them\n\n:[Ponytail is kneeling and breaking off part of an ice cap.
