But at this point music stores are just rooms where CDs are set out to age before they're thrown away, so probably nobody would see it.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn this comic, Cueball, as a student, moves into a dorm. There is a poster on the wall with the album artwork, by {{w|Hipgnosis}}, for {{w|Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd's}} album {{w|The Dark Side of the Moon}}. It shows a beam of light passing through a {{w|dispersive prism}} and separating into a rainbow. This is a fairly common poster to have on a wall, particularly for someone in their late teens to early twenties, and is generally seen as a clich√©. After thinking a bit, the new student makes a poster that uses a lens to reverse the rainbow into another prism, likely to mess with his new roommate. This idea actually isn't very innovative, because the original backside of the album contained the reverse rainbow and prism (but not the lens). The setup with two prisms was used by Isaac Newton to prove that white light is composed of different colors of light.\n\nIn the title text, Randall makes the joke that by recording a record under the name \"PINK FTFY\" (fixed that for you), the name of his band would come immediately after Pink Floyd alphabetically, so the album would be to the right of Pink Floyd's album for Dark Side of the Moon, allowing for the same image seen in the back of the dorm room to be on the shelves of the record store. Since the cover of his album would be catching the light from Pink Floyd's album and forming white light once again, Randall would be \"fixing\" the cover of Dark Side of the Moon. However [[Randall]] makes the crack that no one would see the joke, because of the fact that most music is bought and downloaded online, which has significantly decreased the traffic to record stores in recent years - catastrophically so at the time of this comic's publication, before the popularity of vinyl rebounded in the late 2010s.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball finds his dorm room. He is standing with a paper in his hand in front of a door labeled \"117\".]\n:Paper: 117\n\n:[View into the dorm room. The left half is already occupied, and a roommate has filled his side with the normal accoutrements of dorm life. There is a Pink Floyd \"Dark Side of the Moon\" poster hanging on the far wall, offset and only on the roommate's side.]\n\n:[Cueball has a bit of a ponder.]\n\n:[Cueball leaves for a bit.]\n\n:[Cueball returns with an item.]\n\n:[View into the dorm room. Cueball is moving in, and has placed a second Pink Floyd \"Dark Side of the Moon\" poster modified with a lens in the rainbow's path. The poster is placed upside down on Cueball's side of the far wall to catch the rainbow, feed it back into the prism, and turn it back into a narrow stream of white light.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
