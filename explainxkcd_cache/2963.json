It is arranged as a table of five columns of conduits to and from a house, by five rows of resources and people, each of which typically enter, exit or both enter ''and'' exit the house via at least one of the identified conduits. The table cells have a green background for compatible methods of transit; a red tint is used for the more problematic pairings. Each panel can be read as \"[row label] [entering and/or exiting] the house via the [column label]\", for example, \"Fresh water entering the house via the well\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #E6C3C3;\"\n|+ Explanations of the \"House Inputs and Outputs\" table cell drawings\n! !! Well !! Garage !! Power lines !! Front door !! Septic tank\n|-\n! Fresh water (Input)\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| The purpose of a well is usually to supply fresh water into the home, primarily for drinking or washing. It may be unnecessary in many places if a reliable {{w|water supply network}} is available. || Long gone are the days of {{w|Labours_of_Hercules#Fifth:_Augean_stables|having to clean up after your primary mode of transportation}}, for most people. A source of water may be useful to clean a vehicle itself, although this would perhaps be more commonly done outside. || Power lines conduct electricity, not water. The two functions are inherently dangerous if carelessly combined. Water can be used to cool high-energy lines, such as fast battery charger cables[https://www.connectortips.com/where-liquid-cooled-connectors-and-connectors-for-liquid-cooling-used-in-evs-faq/] and cables supplying electric arc furnaces, but not overhead residential power lines. || Many people prefer to control the amount of water they get, and contain it to a controlled area, since the water may damage things inside the house. || Pumping water into a septic tank could cause it to back up, resulting in the unpleasant contents being forced back in to the house. Also, if this were the only supply of water, most people would prefer anything they drink not to contain (or go through pipes that have contained) sewage.\n|-\n! Cars (Input/Output)\n| Most cars can't fit inside most wells. Storing them in a well is also likely to be inconvenient when you come to need to use them again.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Garages are in fact built for the storage of cars and other similarly-sized vehicles. Placing a car in one will both help protect it from the elements and make it easier to access from inside your own home. || The illustration has the car actually balancing upon the strained wire, a rather difficult 'track' to drive upon, even assuming the cable is strong enough to withstand the forces. || Most cars can’t fit through a typical front door, and are likely to cause damage if forced. || Comedian {{w|Garrison Keillor}}'s 2008 ''More News from Lake Wobegon'' includes a story where an old septic tank is discovered to actually be a buried car.[https://theseriouscomedysite.com/comedy-cd-or-download/garrison-keillor-more-news-from-lake-wobegon/]\n|-\n! Electricity (Input)\n| Wells are not designed to safely and effectively transfer electrical power to the devices that require it. The water would mostly just conduct the electricity into the surrounding construction. || In the United States, lightning is responsible for causing around 24,600 structure fires annually, resulting in $8 to $10 billion in losses.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| Power lines are designed to facilitate the connection of individual homes to the broader local power network. [[Randall]] omits the fact that electricity can also be an output; e.g. houses with solar panels regularly export electricity too. || {{w|Benjamin Franklin}} invented the {{w|lightning rod}} to prevent lightning strike damage to structures. || As Knit Cap observes, septic tanks are not a source of electric power.\n|-\n! People (Input/Output)\n|style=\"background-color: #E6C3C3\"| Being inside a well is very dangerous for most people.{{Citation needed}} The comic depicts a view from inside a well (as a [[:Category:Comics with inverted brightness|dark scene]], it is drawn <span style=\"background-color: black; color: #E6C3C3;\">red-on-black</span>). The motif resembles poster art for the 2002 horror movie remake ''{{w|The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring}}'', which involves a girl left to die in a well who becomes a vengeful ghost (see also [[396: The Ring]]).\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| A person can enter and exit their home through a garage door, provided the garage has an internal door to the rest of the home (as is usually the case for attached garages like the one in the image). Though it is perhaps a fairly common way for such a house's residents to conveniently enter and exit, it isn't generally the best way to welcome or discharge most guests. || Overhead power lines to homes are generally not strong enough to climb, and attempting to do so incurs a very serious risk of electrocution. \n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| The front door of a home is designed for entry and exit of humans and similarly sized items. || In general, people find crawling through waste unpleasant. Also, the septic tank is not connected to the street.\n|-\n! Sewage (Output)\n| Sewage in drinking water can cause disease. It is/was the main cause for most {{w|cholera}} epidemics, which was clarified by {{w|John Snow}} during 1854 cholera outbreak in London.\n|colspan=3| Sewage spills are smelly, disgusting and hard to clean. They can destroy carpets, floors, drywall and property value.\n|style=\"background-color: #C5E6C3;\"| A {{w|septic tank}} is an underground chamber through which wastewater flows for basic {{w|sewage treatment}}.\n|}\n\nThe title text references {{w|Power over Ethernet|power over ethernet (PoE)}}, first implemented in the early 2000s, to provide electric power along with data on twisted-pair Ethernet cabling. A welcome development, it removed the need for many separate power supplies. While networked water delivery (\"running water\") is also a welcome development, doing so over ethernet cables would be extremely problematic, risking several top points of failure, while providing limited amounts of water. However, again, electric vehicle fast charging cables and arc furnace power inputs are sometimes water-cooled.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A 5x5 grid of squares.
