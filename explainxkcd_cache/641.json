Wait -- this one over here has no swine flu! Now I can't decide.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Asbestos}} is a fibrous material most commonly known and used for its heat-resistant properties. It was commonly used in housing insulation until its astonishingly destructive effects on human lungs were discovered. The use of asbestos in housing is now banned, but asbestos is still quite common in laboratory hot pads, as well as in concrete industrial buildings where the risk of it getting into the air is minimal.\n\nThe comic depicts a common advertising trick taken to an absurd extreme; asbestos would not be encountered nor added to cereal and thus it is considered obvious that all cereal is free from asbestos. However, here one brand of cereal is advertising this fact, implying that it is not the norm and the other cereals contain asbestos. Note that in some countries, like Germany for example, this practice is actually not allowed, since it counts as \"misleading advertising\".\n\nWhile the suggestive implication might be that competitive products do not declare as asbestos free because they cannot truthfully say this, the irony may be that the \"asbestos-free\" disclaimer could also cause a customer to ''distrust'' the product on the grounds of {{w|Damning with faint praise|damning by faint praise}}—if the best thing they can say about a product is that it doesn't contain a toxic building material, do we really want to know what actually ''is'' in this stuff?\n\nThe claim in the title text—that a rival product has no {{w|swine flu}}—is equally superfluous, as any food product containing disease-causing viruses would be subject to recalls, severe fines, and quite a few people losing their jobs; the fact that the product is actually on a supermarket shelf implies that it already has a stellar reputation for not causing serious illness.{{Citation needed}} The use of it here could also be a reference to [[574: Swine Flu]].\n\nThe competing claims, however, sets up the ''hopefully'' false risks involved in whether to choose the one with definitely no asbestos (but possibly contains swine flu) or the other that definitely has no swine flu (but may include asbestos).\n\n* GenCo probably stands for {{w|Generic brand|Generic}} or General Company and may be a reference to {{w|General Mills}}\n\n* [http://ghostbusters.wikia.com/wiki/Stay_Puft_Marshmallows Stay Puft] is also the company that produces marshmallows in the movie franchise [[wikipedia:Ghostbusters_%28franchise%29| Ghostbusters]].\n\n* Redfarm is likely referring to cereal companies that advertise their \"farm freshness\", maybe a reference to Pepperidge Farm. It is also a [http://redfarmnyc.com/ Chinese Restaurant] in NYC, although this is most likely a coincidence.\n\nMisleading advertising is also the subject of the previous comic [[624: Branding]], and of subsequent comics [[870: Advertising]] and [[993: Brand Identity]].\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* This comic is the TropeNamer of a {{tvtropes|AsbestosFreeCereal|documented trope}}, as well as being the page image for that trope's entry.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A shelf holds 3 boxes of cereal.
