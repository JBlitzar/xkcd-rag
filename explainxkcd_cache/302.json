This doesn't often happen with one's own significant other, however, hence the joke.\n\nCueball has been in a relationship with someone but does not know his girlfriend's name. He knows that the relationship has progressed to the point where asking for her name would be awkward and impolite, and so he waits for someone to call her by name. Cueball is excited when one finally does, only to reveal that they are in the middle of a wedding ceremony. It is hard to be in a relationship with someone if you don't know their name, and for said relationship to progress to the point of a wedding is simply incredulous.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title-text talks about how it's sometimes tricky to say the right things during an introduction, and while making sure you don't make an incorrect response (replying to the question \"How're you doing?\" with \"Not much,\" for example, mishearing the question as \"What are you doing?\"), one can sometimes forget to pay attention to the actual ''important'' part of the introduction: the person's name. And it's awkward to ask someone for their name when you ''should,'' by all rights, already know it.\n\nForgetting people's names is a frequent symptom of various social anxiety disorders, but it can happen to anybody at any time.\n\nThis comic may have been inspired by [https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2003-04-16 this SMBC comic].\n\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Next to Cueball's foot is an object, that cannot yet be identified.]\n:Cueball (thinking): I hate it when I don't know someone's name, but it's been long enough that it's too awkward to ask.\n\n:[The scene is revealed to be at the altar getting married by a minister to a woman in a bridal dress. The unknown object at Cueball's foot in the first panel turns out to have been the trailing hem of the woman's wedding gown.]\n:Minister: Do you, Rachel, take this man...\n:Cueball (thinking): Aha!
