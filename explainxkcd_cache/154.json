Young Earth creationism is mainly based on {{w|Biblical literalism|literal interpretations of the Bible}}, which is [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Creationism pseudoscience]. The professor is originally not bothered by the fact that someone believes in Young Earth creationism and simply tells the child to look at the scientific {{rw|evidence}}. However, she then hears that the person is actually a {{w|United States Senate|United States senator}}, who would presumably influence national policy according to his creationist beliefs. This, she acknowledges, is an actual problem.\n\nThe comment on the fossils refers to an argument by some Young Earth creationists about the {{rw|Evidence_against_a_recent_creation#Lack_of_DNA_in_fossils:_100.2C000|discovery of fossilized sea creatures at high altitudes}}. While mainstream science sees this as evidence of geological processes taking far longer than six thousand years, these creationists say that sea life reached these locations during a worldwide flood that covered even the tops of mountains.\n\nThe story of this flood, colloquially called ''{{rw|Noah's_Ark|Noah's Ark}}'', is found in the Biblical {{w|Book of Genesis}}; [http://biblehub.com/genesis/6.htm chapters six through nine]. Though it is not stated in {{w|the Bible}} story, many sea creatures are presumed by those who make this claim to have died at high altitudes when the waters lowered. This is a theory held by some Young Earth creationists for the fossils.\n\nThe last panel is a reference to the fact that a number of people vote based on their perception that the person they're voting for shares their religious views, and then that person goes on to make legislative or educational (if they were voted to a board of education) decisions based on said beliefs.  There have been several instances in the U.S. of state boards of education trying to or succeeding at including young-earth or other creationist theories in the state's science curriculum. See for instance {{w|Theistic evolution}}.\n\nThe title text makes a further, more playful jab, claiming that {{w|scientist}}s not only have the upper hand in reasoning but also in sexiness. This subverts the once-commonly held idea that smarts and attractiveness are not always contained in the same \"package,\" the stereotypical scientist being boring and dull. It also adds a tinge of irony, as no competent reasoner would make an {{w|Argument from authority|argument from sexiness}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A girl with long black hair and a professor who looks like Megan stand together. The girl points to Cueball in the distance.]\n:Girl: Professor, that man claims the earth is 6,000 years old!\n:Professor: So? Just use your head and don't concern yourself overmuch with what other people think.\n\n:[Cueball is gone and the girl is no longer pointing but just talking to the professor.]\n:Girl: But he says the fossils in the mountains were put there in a flood!\n:Professor: Well, evidence suggests that they were not.\n:Girl: But he--\n\n:[A mountain landscape with blue sky to the left with white clouds, gray clod cover to the right and gray mountains below. The most prominent peak is just right of the middle, but there are 14 small and large peaks all in all.]\n:Professor (off-panel): A million people can call the mountains a fiction, yet it need not trouble you as you stand atop them.\n\n:[The girl throws her hands in the air while the professor just looks at her.]\n:Girl: But he believes the silliest things!\n:Professor: So?\n\n:[The girl has her arms down again and looks on the talking professor.]\n:Professor: The universe doesn't care what you <u>believe</u>. \n:Professor: The wonderful thing about science is that it doesn't ask for your faith, it just asks for your eyes.\n\n:[The girl and professor talks.]\n:Girl: But he's a US senator!\n:Professor: Ah, then yes, we do have a bit of a situation.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Politics]]"
