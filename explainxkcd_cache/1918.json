Henry, Deep Space Nine, freshwater whitefish, teenaged Incan emperors, Brak's brother, and vegetable-based shortening.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\n[[Cueball]] is confusing {{w|NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS}}, a [https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus USA and Canada border control pre-screening program], with [http://ferngully.wikia.com/wiki/Hexxus Hexxus], the villains from the animated film ''{{w|FernGully: The Last Rainforest|FernGully}}''.\n\nTrusted traveller programs like Nexus allow people who match certain criteria to apply for a membership and subsequently save time when boarding airplanes or crossing borders via use of expedited lanes.\n\nFernGully is a story set in an Australian rainforest inhabited by fairies including Crysta, who accidentally shrinks a young logger named Zak to the size of a fairy. Together, they rally the fairies and the animals of the rainforest to protect their home from the loggers and a malevolent pollution entity, Hexxus. Hexxus has previously been mentioned in [[1750: Life Goals]] as an especially hard-to-spell word and in [[1767: US State Names]] (as a replacement for Texas).\n\nThe title text is confusing {{w|Cisco Systems|Cisco}} (a telecoms & tech brand which has a line of switches called {{w|Cisco Nexus switches|Nexus}}) with:\n* The artist {{w|Sisq√≥}} who performed '{{w|Thong Song}}'\n* {{w|The Cisco Kid}}, a character created by {{w|O. Henry}} in the short story \"The Caballero's Way\"\n* {{w|Benjamin Sisko}}, commander of a space station in the Star Trek Universe (''{{w|Deep Space Nine}}'')\n* {{w|Cisco (fish)|Ciscoes}} (freshwater whitefish)\n* [http://emperorsnew.wikia.com/wiki/Kuzco Kuzco], teenaged Incan emperor in ''{{w|The Emperor's New Groove}}''\n* [http://brak.wikia.com/wiki/Sisto Sisto], brother of Brak in ''{{w|The Brak Show}}''\n* {{w|Crisco}} (vegetable-based shortening)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball walking through an airport.]\n:Sign: Apply for NEXUS Save time at the border\n:Megan: Maybe we should sign up for this.\n:Cueball: No way. I refuse to have anything to do with Nexus after what they did to FernGully.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n<!--hexxus-->\n[[Category:Aviation]]"
