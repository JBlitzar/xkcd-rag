The rope is attached ({{w|tether}}ed) to the pole on one end and to a ball on the other end. The players try to wind the rope in opposite directions and do so by hitting the ball at the rope's loose end with their hands or with paddles. [[Randall]] has the usual configuration last with five stars, preceded by several humorously inane configurations with fewer stars:\n\n'''Ground-rope-ball''' receives only one star because there is no way to keep \"score\". [[Megan]] holds the rope while looking at [[Cueball]] holding the ball. What to do...\n\n'''Ground-pole-ball''' receives only one star because there is no way for anything to happen. The pole is fixed in place, and the ball is fixed in place at the top. [[Ponytail]] can be seen waving her hand at the ball at the top of the pole, but it's too tall and she can't even reach it. [[Hairbun]] has just given up.\n\n'''Ground-rope-pole-ball''' is slightly better than the previous configurations and therefore receives two stars instead of one. The players have some way to keep score by seeing which way the rope is wound around the pole, but a player who is behind can reset the score by pushing the rope windings off of the pole. Also, twirling the rope in order to rack up point windings would be awkward—and possibly even dangerous to the other player, depending on how long the pole is. Lastly, the ball serves no purpose in this case. Ponytail holds the rope while [[White Hat]] holds the ball from which the pole goes up.\n\n'''Ground-pole-rope-ball''' is the best and therefore receives five stars. Players can accumulate point windings by hitting the ball past the other player, and gravity and the pole's height prevent the player who is behind from unscrupulously resetting the score. This is the configuration that is used in real life. Back to Cueball and Megan, who are getting ready to play a regular game of Tetherball.\n\nIn the title text a fifth alternative is mentioned, where there is no rope, and instead a second pole rotates freely around a joint made out of a ball:\n'''Ground-pole-ball-pole''' is mentioned to be fun, because if you shake the pole stuck in the ground, the loose one connected via the ball could begin whipping around dangerously. Whether this is actually entertaining depends on whether you get hit by it... Again, You would not be able to keep score in the same way as regular tetherball, but you could count who got hit by the second loose pole first, or, for instance, the first to 10 hits. Alternatively, you could score a point by managing to make the free pole make a complete rotation without your opponent managing to change its direction. If the pole is not padded, or made of a soft material, this would likely be dangerous,{{citation needed}} or at least painful. Randall also remarks that the ball would probably get torn apart as it acts like a joint between the two poles. No rating is given, but, given that he calls it fun, at least 3 stars might be expected.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four panels show four different configurations in which the elements of a tetherball game could be connected. Two persons are trying to play each of these configurations in each panel, in a side view of the ground and the people and their particular game upon it. Below, within each panel, a star rating with five stars (progressively filled or empty) is shown. Above, within each panel, a label states the combination of parts in use. Above all four panels, there is a heading:]\n:Tetherball configuration playability ratings\n\n:[Megan holds on to the rope with both hands while looking at Cueball holding the ball in both hands, who is looking back at her. They are standing at equal distances on either side of where the rope is connected to the ground. The rope goes from the ground to the left up and through Megan's hands and then to the right over to the ball. The configuration has a one-star rating, with one filled and four empty stars.]\n:Ground–rope–ball\n\n:[Ponytail is stretching as high as she can while waving one hand towards the ball that sits at the top of a pole much taller than she is. Hairbun is standing on the other side of the pole looking at Ponytail. The configuration gets a one-star rating, with one filled and four empty stars.]\n:Ground–pole–ball\n\n:[Ponytail is looking at and holding on to the rope to the left of, but close to, where it is tethered to the ground. The rope then goes up to the top of a pole, but this pole is supported only by its attachment at the other end to the ball, which White Hat looks at as he holds it in both hands to angle it steeply up in Ponytail's direction. The configuration gets a two-star rating, with two filled and three empty stars.]\n:Ground–rope–pole–ball\n\n:[Cueball is standing to the left of the pole, from where a rope goes down to the right to a ball that Megan balances on one hand while preparing to hit it with her other hand. She is looking at the ball and Cueball is looking at Megan. This standard configuration of tetherball gets a five-star rating, with five full stars.]\n:Ground–pole–rope–ball\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Sport]]\n[[Category:Rankings]]"
