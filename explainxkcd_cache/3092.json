This stems from a tradition in medieval times whereby salespeople would include 13 items when selling a 'dozen'. This was due to them having to pay penalties (in some regions, {{w|Ducking stool|draconian}} ones) when customers were [https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/inspire-me/obscure-medieval-laws/ sold too little bread]<!--\nDUBIOUS: Do people really believe this? Sadly, I guess the Wikipedia article is the place to debate this, although I fear there is a https://xkcd.com/978/ problem. In any event, the battle is lost? ~~~~ -->, which could easily be done unintentionally with items like loaves of bread which would vary slightly in weight. To avoid the customer complaints and the penalty, bakers added a safety margin of one extra loaf that allowed them to still serve the correct weight of bread.\n\n[[Randall]] proceeds to apply this principle to other things involving the number 12. That is, \"simply\" applying a count of 13 of a thing, or adding one to the most prominent quantity.\n\n; Baker's foot\n\n: Imperial feet are 12 inches long, so a 'baker's foot' would be 13 inches long.\n\n; Baker's noon\n\n: Noon is 12 o'clock (also 12:00 in {{w|24-hour clock}} notation). A 'baker's noon' would be 1 o'clock PM (13:00 in 24-hour notation). Local noon has often been a vital piece of information for those who need to know when the working daylight is half-way through, or specifically for noting the {{w|Solar time|local solar maximum}} for astronomical or navigation purposes, whilst 1 PM does not usually merit any note beyond that of any other hour — except during daylight saving time, when baker's noon may be closer to local noon than 12 o'clock. In some locations, bakeries that operate on sundays close their business around noon - the baker's noon would be an inconvenience instead of a safety margin for these businesses.\n\n; Baker's dodecahedron\n\n: A {{w|dodecahedron}} is a solid shape having 12 faces (\"dodeca\" = \"twelve\"). The best-known kind is the regular dodecahedron, a {{w|Platonic solid}} whose faces are regular pentagons (the shape that most {{w|Dice#Polyhedral dice|d12}}s take the form of), but there are others such as the {{w|rhombic dodecahedron}} and {{w|Pyritohedron#Pyritohedron|pyritohedron}}. A 'baker's dodecahedron' would have thirteen faces, making it, in fact, a tridecahedron, typically a form with some combination of triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons and/or hexagons. One way of forming a tridecahedron is to truncate one vertex of a dodecahedron, essentially \"replacing\" it with an additional small face. Tridecahedrons are not Platonic solids, and their use in dice-based games (though not impossible) would result in an unbalanced skew of possibilities, as well as one extra result (perhaps zero or thirteen) that a gaming system might not be designed to anticipate.\n\n; Baker's New Year's Eve\n\n: Under the {{w|Gregorian calendar}}, years have 12 months and, in most Western traditions, New Year's Eve is celebrated on the last day of the 12th of these. Therefore a baker would celebrate 'baker's New Year's Eve' at the end of an extra 13th month, on January 31 (possibly implying that their New Year would shift by one month each year, relative to everyone else's calendars). There are proposed calendars that have 13 months in every year, such as the {{w|International Fixed Calendar}}.\n\n; Baker's octave\n\n: In {{w|12 equal temperament|12-tone music systems}}, octaves contain 12 half-steps, also known as semitones. (A half-step is the distance between adjacent notes, such as F and F#.) A 'baker’s octave' would have 13 semitones, corresponding to a minor ninth, and would cause problems in musical composition as baker's octaves are dissonant instead of consonant. However, Randall's musical notation actually shows a ''major'' ninth, with ''fourteen'' semitones. If he wanted thirteen semitones, Randall could have used D♭ instead of D, or drawn a bass clef instead of a treble clef. Another way would have been to shift two notes up to make the pair E and F, or one note down to make it B and C, as these pairs are actually 13 semitones apart. Alternatively, he could keep the difference between the octave notes the same (preserving the ratio of 2:1), but split it into 13 semitones making notes slightly less than a standard semitone apart, requiring a complete overhaul of notation.\n\n; Baker's jury\n\n: Trial juries in the Anglo-Saxon law tradition ({{w|Common Law}}) consist of 12 peers. The 'baker’s jury' would have 13 peers. This might be considered to make little practical difference, though it does mean that in situations where a jury is allowed to present a majority verdict instead of requiring unanimity, the odd number of jurors would prevent exact ties. (Note that {{w|Trial by jury in Scotland|Scottish juries}}, start with the expectation of there being 15 jurors, and may well end up reduced to 13 or even 12.)\n\n; Baker's EU flag\n\n: The {{w|Flag of Europe}} has 12 stars forming a circle (symbolising the togetherness and union of its peoples). \n: In the United States, 13 stars in a circle is associated with the {{w|Betsy Ross flag}}, the first U.S. flag, in which each star represented a state. But, unlike {{w|Flag of the United States#Historical progression of designs|the current and various historical US flags}}, the EU's stars do not represent member states. The flag was first adopted by the Council of Europe in 1955, when it already had 13 members, and currently there are over 40.\n: The European Communities adopted the Flag of Europe in 1986, before the EC, turned into the European Union, which is currently 27 member states. A 13th star could potentially be added to make a 'baker's EU flag' without major alteration of the symbology. \n\n; Baker's magnesium\n\n: Magnesium is element number 12, with 12 protons (and, typically, 12 neutrons) in its nucleus. Aluminum is element number 13, signifying one extra proton (although also having ''two'' extra neutrons, in a typical atom). This is perhaps more importantly, for our purposes, reflected in the two elements' configuration of electrons that dictate their relatively different chemistries and behaviour in various solutions, compounds, alloys, etc, through {{w|Valence (chemistry)|valence}} and availability of bond-types. 'Baker's magnesium' actually has more applications than standard magnesium in baking; such as {{w|sodium aluminium phosphate}}, used in some baking powders, and {{w|aluminum foil}} (often called tinfoil), sometimes used to protect pans or baked goods during baking, but it does not have as much actual nutritional value and is not quite so obviously a direct replacement/upgrade to its non-Baker 'original' as most of the other examples.\n\n; Baker's gross\n\n: In the title text, 144 (12x12) is a gross. Thus, 169 (13x13) would be a 'baker's gross', an addition of not just one but 25 units.\n\n==Transcript==\n:<u>Baker's units</u>\n:[A formation comprising 13 small circular items] - Baker's dozen\n:[A ruler divided into 13 parts] - Baker's foot\n:1:00 PM - Baker's noon\n:[A polyhedron with 13 faces] - Baker's dodecahedron\n:January 31st - Baker's New Year's Eve\n:[Two notes on a staff 14 half-steps apart] - Baker's octave\n:[13 people standing in a row] - Baker's jury\n:[A flag with 13 stars forming a circle] - Baker's EU flag\n:Aluminum - Baker's magnesium\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Time]]"
