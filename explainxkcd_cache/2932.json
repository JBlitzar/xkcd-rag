Some drivers, when having {{w|Traffic#Passage_priority_(right_of_way)|priority}} by the rules of the road (termed \"right of way\" in US legal statutes), will let others take it before them. However, yielding the right of way when it is not required does not legally grant the other driver the right of way -- they may still be required to yield to other vehicles on the road. (Hence the title of the PSA: \"Random drivers can't grant you the right of way as a gift.\")\n\nAt a 4-way stop, giving another driver the right of way is usually safe and courteous, but in other cases it can be dangerous. This comic is saying that people who exhibit this behavior dangerously can be assumed to be {{w|The_Terminator|Terminator}}-style assassins, sent to kill you by sending you into contention with other traffic to make it look like an accident, and thereby prevent some future act on your part that is not to their liking.\n\nIn this comic, the deferential driver is holding up a queue of vehicles (including a large tractor-trailer truck) that is obscuring the immediate view of oncoming traffic. Instead of simply turning left and reducing the queue, they are waving Randall's car into that traffic, perhaps because they forgot that the other lanes have priority over the crossing driver. The effect could be to wave him through right into the path of another car traveling at full speed — a clever way for a time-traveling assassin to take down one's target without arousing suspicion.\n\nNot pulling into traffic when your view is obstructed is good advice, and Randall's comical exaggeration may make the advice more memorable. Always check for yourself that your way is clear, and if your view is blocked, sit tight. \n\nHowever, Randall seems to be assuming that the waving gesture can only ever mean one thing: Pull all the way into traffic. It may be that a \"waving out\" gesture is intended to give the waiting car a chance to turn into the median strip (see details below). Viewing courteous behavior as conclusive evidence of a temporal assassination conspiracy is humorously ego-centric and improbable.\n\nThe title text explains that Randall made this PSA because he has experienced this multiple times in the last month, and that the assassins should try harder next time. \n\n===Alternate interpretation of the waving gesture===\n\nNote that in this comic, as currently illustrated, there appears to be sufficient room in the median strip for the waiting car to pass the first set of lanes and stop in the median strip, protected from passing traffic on both sides, to legally wait for the second stream of traffic to safely subside. Waiting in this median turning area is a normal maneuver in suburban and exurban US areas where these types of non-signaled intersections are common. There's no reason to assume that the supposed would-be assassin is not simply waving the waiting car to the safety of the median strip. Randall's message of caution is still sound, but he accidentally illustrated an intersection diagram that fails to optimally support his case.\n\n[[File:2932 Alt.png|frameless|Illustration showing room to safely turn left halfway, stopping in the median strip]] \n\n'''Legality'''\n\nMedian strips are typically used to allow vehicles to safely make left turns without impeding the flow of traffic. When emerging from a side road, vehicles can cross the first lane(s) of traffic and wait in the median strip until it is safe to merge into the opposite lane(s).\n* In Texas, using the median strip to wait for a gap in traffic is generally acceptable. The Texas Department of Public Safety suggests that drivers use the median strip when appropriate.
