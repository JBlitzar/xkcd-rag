[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sketchy Urban Dictionary] provides a good definition of \"someone or something that gives off a bad feeling\".\n\nIn this comic, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] rates words by how sketchy they make the sentence \"Hey baby, wanna come back to my sex ____?\" when inserted into the blank. As noted from the scale (which already starts at \"sketchy\" and goes up to \"very sketchy\"), the sentence itself is already inherently sketchy, in that it sounds like it would be a pickup line delivered by a person attempting to solicit sex from a stranger.\n\nThe sketchiness is increased by the various words which run from the ''relatively'' common or understood to the obscure and unusual.\n\nThe first few are actual terminology: A sex party or sex {{w|orgy}} are basically group sex parties at which multiple parties engage in sexual activity. A {{w|sex dungeon}} is a location where {{w|BDSM}} (bondage/submission — think leather and handcuffs) activity is engaged in. \"Sex House\" is the name of an {{w|Onion_News_Network|Onion News Network}} parody of reality shows like Big Brother.\n\nAs the scale increases, the words become simply locations where sex might take place, which increase from comfortable to unusual and creepy (i.e. sex crate, sex ravine, sex tarp). It is particularly sketchy because of the phrasing of the sentence which implies the speaker has a specific [insert word] used for sex. It might be sketchy enough to walk up to someone and suggest \"let's go down in the ravine and have sex\", but it is made sketchier when the phrasing suggests going to \"my sex ravine\".\n\nThe title text continues the thought process with further possible sketchy words, beginning with more odd locations and moving on to \"onslaught\", an abundant wave of attack or overwhelming amount of something — in this case sex; \"extractor\" suggests some sort of device that might force someone to have sex; and finally \"judge\", suggesting the speaker has someone in mind to judge sex. Very sketchy indeed.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A timeline-style graph.]\n:'''Words'''\n:Arranged by how sketchy they make the sentence\n:'''\"Hey baby, wanna come back to my sex _______?\"'''\n:sketchy <--------> very sketchy\n:party --- orgy --- dungeon --- palace --- house --- shrine --- room --- basement --- truck --- platform --- van --- area --- crate --- chute --- ravine --- tarp \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
