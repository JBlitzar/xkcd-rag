Obviously this method of reloading would not work in real life.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe title text tells you to watch out for the guy from comic [[53: Hobby]], which shows a man who randomly pops up to the police when they are performing a drug raid. This refers to the random figures that pop out at many games; if they are not a valid target and you shoot them, you will lose points.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four soldiers are preparing to enter a battlefield; their leader addresses them.]\n:Leader: Okay men, we're going in. Stay low, keep behind cover, and if you run out of ammunition, shoot outside the battlefield to reload.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Video games]]"
