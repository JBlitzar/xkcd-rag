In the case of {{w|Wikipedia}} and other wikis powered by {{w|MediaWiki}} (including this website), they are blue for non-visited and purple for visited. In this comic, [[Randall]] is ashamed of the pages he has visited, because with the color changes there is evidence of what he has visited in the past, e.g. {{w|autoerotic asphyxiation}} (possibly while researching [[682: Force]], which features that very Wikipedia page).\n\nThe pages that he did visit before are in great contrast with the pages that he hasn't. Pages he didn't click are often difficult, highly intelligent topics, while he only clicks the easy, funny articles with little scientific background on the Wikipedia site.\n\nThe title text refers to a common mistake many people make when reading articles on Wikipedia. Words referring to subjects that have an article on Wikipedia are colored in blue. This, however, can cause confusion when two words leading to two separate articles appear together, as the two links appear to be one. However, on hovering the cursor over the article link, only one word at a time is underlined, showing that the links are separate.\n\nIt is not possible to determine who this fake article is supposed to be about, but the Macarena band is certainly from Dos Hermanas, Spain. So, it is quite possibly a made-up article from [[Randall]].\n\n==Transcript==\n[The following is in the standard format of a Wikipedia article, modified to reflect the content of the comic. The First and Last paragraph was partially cutoff]\n:...and was a pioneer of literary <u>social realism</u>[link not clicked].\n\n:He was born in <u>Dos Hermanas</u>[link not clicked] in the <u>Andalusia</u>[link not clicked] region of <u>Spain</u>[link not clicked] (not to be confused with <u>Andalasia</u>[link clicked], the kingdom in Disney's <u>''Enchanted''</u>[link clicked]), which is also the hometown of <u>''Macarena''</u>[link clicked] band <u>Los Del RÃ­o</u>[link clicked],\n\n:His <u>third novel</u>[link not clicked], set during the <u>Burmese-Siamese war</u>[link not clicked], marked the start of a lifelong interest in the <u>history of Southeast Asia</u>[link not clicked]. He spent his later years in <u>Thailand</u>[link not clicked], writing his his final novels just a few blocks from the hotel where actor <u>David Carradine</u>[link clicked] died of <u>Autoerotic Asphyxiation</u>[link clicked].\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:If I go for a while without clearing my browser history, I start getting embarrassd by which words on Wikipedia show up in purple.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the caption of the comic, embarrassed is spelled incorrectly.\n* In the third paragraph, there is an extra \"his\" in the phrase \"writing his his final novels\".\n* Wikipedia's internal Manual of Style [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking&oldid=1294512359#Wingsuit_combat used \"Wingsuit Combat\"] as an example for the guideline that links should not be placed next to each other [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style%2FLinking&diff=prev&oldid=1267219169 from January 4] to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking&diff=prev&oldid=1294513685 June 8, 2025]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Wingsuit]]\n[[Category:Disney]]"
