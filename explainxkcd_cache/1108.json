In this comic the ghost wakes up a man who is intent on correcting people's usage of the word \"literally.\" People often use \"literally\" as emphasis or exaggeration to a figurative statement, when the word's original meaning was that something had happened exactly as described. A statement such as \"I literally ate 40 lbs of chocolate\" might be said, when the person might have only actually eaten half a pound. A more correct statement would be \"I ate a large amount of chocolate.\"\n\nThe ghost shows the protagonist two futures, one where he keeps correcting people, and one where he stops. That the two \"different\" futures are exactly (i.e., literally) the same suggests that the man's struggle to get people to stop using \"literally\" incorrectly will have no meaningful effect on the world, and so the man (and by extension, everyone else) may as well stop wasting time and energy on it.\n\nIronically, the title text indicates that a second apparition encouraged the man to continue the fight on a different grammatical issue, the use of the phrase \"if it were,\" which is frequently incorrectly substituted with \"if it was.\" \"Were\" is correctly used in a hypothetical condition, when referencing something that may not be true. The ghost of subjunctive past references the ghost of Christmas past and the {{w|English subjunctive#Use of the past subjunctive|'Subjunctive past tense'}}. The following sentences illustrate the correct usages:\n*If I were rich, I wouldn't have to work for a living.\n*When I was rich, I didn't have to work for a living.\n\nAnother xkcd comic, [[725: Literally]], also refers to the overly mocked usage of \"literally.\"\n\nA similar ghost is seen in [[1393: Timeghost]], where it reminds Cueball about the passing of time, and [[2836: A Halloween Carol]] similarly parodies Dickens's ''A Christmas Carol''.\n\n===Popular Culture===\nThe comics ''[https://explosm.net/comics/matt-literally-a-comic Cyanide & Happiness]'' and ''[https://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally The Oatmeal]'' offer examples of this sort of derision.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A man wakes up to an apparition hovering over his bed.]\n:Apparition: ''ooOOOOOOOOOOooooo''\n:Man: A ghost!?\n:Apparition: ''I bring a '''cautionary vision''' of things to come!''\n\n:Apparition: This is the future:\n:[Two people are standing between a pair of houses. There is a tree. An airplane flies past.]\n\n:Apparition: And '''''this''''' is the future if you give up the fight over the word \"literally\":\n:[Two people are standing between a pair of houses. There is a tree. An airplane flies past. The cynical might suggest the panel is copy pasted.]\n\n:[Back to the man in bed.]\n:Man: They looked exactly the same.\n:Apparition: ''ooOOOOOOOOOOOooo''\n:Man: Ok, I get it.\n:Apparition: Seriously, this is duuuuumb.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]"
