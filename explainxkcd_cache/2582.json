[[Megan]] warns him against doing {{w|Data analysis|analysis}} because analysis produces more data â€” specifically, {{w|Metadata|data ''about'' the data}}. This is implied to be a bad thing, as in, having \"too much\" data is undesirable &mdash; perhaps he will be expected to analyze the metadata, then analyze the metadata created by the metadata, and so on. However, data generated from analysis may provide useful insights about the original data set, e.g. finding {{w|Correlation|trends or correlations}} between data points. Avoiding the analysis or deleting its data could deprive the analyzer of useful information. And, in the case that the analysis is flawed or impossible, there is little danger in disposing of any resulting reports.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe title text proposes an alternate solution: destructive analysis. It is important that the method chosen to analyze the data destroys as much information as it created, thus keeping the total amount of data constant. This expands on the concept of not having a surplus of data, suggesting that any analysis should destroy as much data as it produces. This would make data constant in quantity or in an equilibrium; of course, data doesn't actually have this limitation,{{Citation needed}} and the user can create as much data as is needed or desired.\n\nIn the quantum world {{w|information}} can neither be destroyed or created; see the {{w|no-hiding theorem}}, for instance. [https://www.nps.gov/archeology/collections/coll_05.htm Destructive analysis] is a term used in archeology; as the name implies the thing that you study is destroyed by the analysis. However, destructive analysis is rarely or never used to study data.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at his desk, hands on his knees, looking at his laptop. Megan stands behind him, with her arms raised to the sides and above her head.]\n:Cueball: Hey, look, we have a bunch of data! I'm gonna analyze it.\n:Megan: No, you fool! '''''That will only create more data!'''''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Science]]"
