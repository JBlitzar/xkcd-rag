It ALL is.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic refers to a [http://en.allexperts.com/q/Astronomy-1360/question-black-holes-1.htm common analogy] used to explain how mass distorts space-time — a bowling ball resting on a sheet of rubber distorts the sheet due to its weight. The system has some qualitative features in common with gravity; it's often misused to show that \"mass warps spacetime\" ([[895: Teaching Physics]]).\n\nThe next part of the original analogy explains a black hole: the slope of the sheet becomes so deep that you can't climb out from the bottom any more, similar to a black hole, which even light can't escape from. However, the comic subverts the analogy, and the sheet becomes a trampoline instead.\n\nReading onwards, it seems that [[Beret Guy]] is just messing about with the scenario.\n\nThe line \"Imagining is ''fun!''\" is also a homage to {{w|Richard P. Feynman}}'s \"Fun to Imagine\" Series of Interviews. The power of Beret Guy's imagination—so that he can physically experience what he imagines—is reminiscent of [[248: Hypotheticals]].\n\nThe title text also states that the rubber sheet, broken rope and trampoline are still all about physics (see also [[435: Purity]]).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret guy is standing on a giant bowling ball on a rubber sheet. Megan is watching.]\n:Beret Guy: Imagine a giant bowling ball on a rubber sheet.\n:Beret Guy: The ball's weight makes a dent in the sheet.\n\n:[A rope is pulling the ball down into the sheet.]\n:Beret Guy: Now imagine a rope that pulls the ball down even further.\n:Beret Guy: ...Annnnd...\n\n:[Rope lets go. Ball is catapulted with Beret Guy on it.]\n:'''BOOOIING'''\n:Beret Guy: Wheee\n\n:[Beret guy and ball are falling back down.]\n:Megan: ...Oh. I thought this was about physics.\n:Beret Guy: Imagining is ''fun!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
