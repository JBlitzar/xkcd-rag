This lets them identify the title and artist of an unnamed recorded musical extract. In this comic, [[Megan]] hacks the acoustic fingerprint database to add her own entry with a message to [[Cueball]], in which she asks him to buy [[1022|cat food]].\n\nMegan would use this app again in [[1199: Silence]].\n\nHTTP error code 406 means Not Acceptable. When a client requests data from a server, the client lists the data formats that it can accept. If a server is unable to provide data in any format that the client accepts, the server returns error 406 Not Acceptable. For example, this can occur if a client requests XML but the server supports only JSON. In the title text, the standard meaning of the error message is ignored and the text \"Not Acceptable\" is taken literally: The server is offended by [[Randall]]'s humming.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is humming a tune.]\n:Cueball: Hey.\n:Cueball: What's that?\n\n:[Megan is still humming the same tune.]\n:Cueball: What are you humming?\n:Cueball: Should I know the tune?\n:Cueball: ...Hmm...\n\n:[Cueball gets out his phone and opens up a music recognition program.]\n:Phone: Identify song\n:Phone: Recorded\n:Phone: > Live [beta]\n\n:Phone: Identifying...\n\n:[A zoom in on the phone screen. An album cover with a picture of Megan on it.]\n:Positive match:\n:''Check it out!''\n:By I hacked the audio fingerprint database\n:Feat. MEEEEEE\n:Track: We're out of cat food (pick some up?)\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Cats]]"
