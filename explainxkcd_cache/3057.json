Megan expresses surprise at how late she's 'kept them up', and mentions that she needs to go somewhere early in the morning. Despite this and the fact that sleep is essential,{{Citation needed}} she offers to help tidy up the house before she leaves. This is considered the most polite way to leave, as it suggests that they're leaving, not because they don't enjoy the company, but out of necessity. It expresses concern for the well-being of the host (saying that she's kept them up), and even implies that she'd lost track of time because she'd been having such a good time. Offering to help tidy up, despite being tired, is additionally courteous.\n\nThe second panel shows [[Cueball]] at the same gathering, saying that he must leave due to the fact that he is tired and must sleep. This expresses the same sentiments as Megan's own statement, but in a much more blunt and terse way, and without offering to help clean up. Such an exit is acceptable to most people, but not excessively polite. \n\nEven less polite is the trickster and classhole [[Black Hat]], in the third panel, who excuses himself in typical Black Hat fashion. Instead of him saying that he alone is tired, he says that EVERYONE looks tired ''and'' bored. This is very impolite, especially in a social setting. Saying that people \"look tired\" can be taken as an insult, and claiming that \"everyone looks bored\" simultaneously suggests that the gathering is boring ''and'' that everyone present is either too impolite to hide their boredom, or simply unable to. Claiming to speak for everyone in expressing boredom is arrogant and insulting to both his fellow guests and the hosts. \n\nThe final panel shows three points in time, depicting an unfolding action. [[Megan]] (in a re-hash of the original panel) kicks the table, sending the chair tipping backwards and dumping her onto the floor. She then proceeds to roll away from the table, and presumably outside the house. This is the kind of maneuver one might see in an action movie, as someone tries to escape danger (or capture). In addition to being abrupt, disruptive and potentially damaging (since it clearly knocks over things on the table), this exit sends the message that she's desperate to escape as quickly as possible. It is also a health risk as she may sustain a concussion from such a fall pictured in the comic where the head directly impacts the floor, unless she has {{w|Uke (martial arts)#Ukemi|specifically practiced}} {{w|Stunt#Practical effects|such maneuvers}}.\n\nThe title text adds to the general awkwardness of having to excuse yourself, when Megan has to stop rolling to put her shoes on before continuing. This would not be universal, since it is not the general practice in the United States for party guests to [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-are-shoes-off-at-home/ remove their shoes in someone's home.] But if such were the case, then pausing in the middle of such a dramatic escape would really water down the impact, forcing her to remain in the company of people she'd just dramatically tried to get away from.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:Ways to leave a social interaction:\n:[An arrow pointing towards the right is shown below the caption.
