    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1541\n| date      = June 22, 2015\n| title     = Voice\n| image     = voice.png\n| titletext = Anyway, we should totally go watch a video story or put some food in our normal mouths!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nDuring a casual talk with [[Megan]], [[Ponytail]] suddenly interrupts her normal speech stating that she is for some reason only capable of controlling her own voice once every six years. Apparently only for a very brief time since she immediately returns to the casual talk, continuing her previous sentence mid-word before being able to tell Megan how she could help her. Upon Megan's confused request, she denies knowledge of the occurrence, although in a somewhat suspicious way, using possibly fake laughter.\n\nIt could be this was just a prank by Ponytail, to tease Megan, but given her fake laughter reply to Megan's inquiry and the continuing comment in the title text it seems most likely that Ponytail is indeed possessed by some sort of entity that prevents her from expressing her own thoughts, except for a very short time every six years. Of course this may just be her way of continuing with the prank; see a previous case of such a prank [[#Voice hijacking|below]].\n\nIn case it is not a prank it would thus appear that Ponytail's usual \"self\" is indeed this possessing entity. Whether this entity is actually aware that the \"real\" Ponytail did speak, or if it actually does not know that it was interrupted (since it continued mid-word) is not clear from the last response to Megan.\n\nThe title text suggests that Ponytail {{tvtropes|BodySnatcher|is possessed by some sort of inhuman entity}} (most likely an alien or {{w|AI}}, or possibly a [[1530: Keyboard Mash|small but intelligent creature]] living in her head) unfamiliar with movies and eating. See below for [[#Related comics|related comics]].\n\n===Related comics===\n====Non-human entity trying to behave like a human====\nThe comic [[1530: Keyboard Mash]] also revolves around the same theme of a non-human entity trying to convince other humans that it is in fact a human. This is most clearly referenced in the title text of this comic. In Keyboard Mash, it is a spider that tries to chat like it was a human, making statements that are true if you are human, but which humans would never utter in a conversation like here - ''put some food in our normal mouths!'' However, the pretended 'human' being (the spider) is not seen by the other person in this comic, as opposed to this one where Megan speaks directly with Ponytail.\n\n====Voice hijacking====\nIt has already been established recently, in [[1528: Vodka]], that Ponytail's voice can be hijacked by non-human entities. That time it was the vodka she was drinking that took over. It is possible that this is continuing or caused by the same openness to possession as shown here. It is also possible that she simply thinks possession jokes are funny and once again jokes with Megan.\n\n====Six years ago====\nSix years to the day before this one, which according to this comic was the last time Ponytail had control of her own voice, this comic [[600: Android Boyfriend]] was posted. Ponytail acquired an android boyfriend. It seems unlikely that this older comic has any relation with this particular episode - except that this comic mentions a six-year period and Ponytail is also in that comic.\n\n====Note on Ponytail====\n''Ponytail is mainly a filler character, showing up when two females are needed or when a large group of people are present.''\n\nIt is important to note that [[Ponytail]], like most xkcd [[stick figure|stick figures]], usually does not represent the same character in each comic. This Ponytail is likely unrelated to other instances of Ponytail.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Ponytail are walking.]\n:Megan: Are you doing anything later?\n:Ponytail: I was th- ''I can only control my voice once every six years. Please, you have to'' -inking of going out, but no real plans.\n:Megan: ...What was that?\n:Ponytail: Haha, what?\n\n==Trivia==\n*{{w|Demonic possession|Possession}} stories are common in films and books. Some recent examples that could have inspired this comic could be one of these (beware of '''spoilers'''):\n**In the film {{w|The Host (2013 film)|The Host}} the human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called \"Souls\" that inserts themselves individually into a host body where they are then able to access the host's memories. In the story the main character is the host that controls a body, and then the personality of that body, which is then no longer able to control her body, but can speak to the host. And in a few situations can take over her body for a short period. Very similar to what happens in this comic.\n**The Yeerks from the ''Animorphs'' {{w|Animorphs|books}} and {{w|Animorphs (TV series)|TV series}} take humans as a host by entering and merging with their brain through the ear canal. The host can fight to temporarily take back control, but this is very painful. However how many times human can fight back is not as specific as in this comic. Animorphs is referenced in [[:Category:Animorphs|a few other comics]].\n**In the movie {{w|Being John Malkovich}} the main character possesses Malkovich, but Malkovich is occasionally able to communicate through the possession.\n**In {{w|Warlord (Star Trek: Voyager)|an episode}} of {{w|Star Trek: Voyager}}, Kes is taken over by a warlord who has discovered a means of immortality by using technology to transfer his consciousness to another body. The warlord enters a mental struggle with Kes's latent mind, and as he begins to lose the battle, Kes's personality resurfaces on several occasions.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
