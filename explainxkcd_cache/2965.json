As mentioned above, only the Scoville scale would normally see numbers this high (for example, an 18 on the Richter scale would vaporize the Earth). Allowing for some speculation, it's likely the three base numbers are multiplied, as with {{w|Foot-pound (energy)|similar}} compound-unit calculations, to give the single combined measure (although some nominal types are treated as {{w|Erdős–Bacon number|additive}}). This would be consistent with likely values of the earthquake, tornado, and chilli peppers:\n* Richter: Since the building is still there it is not a 9 on the Richter scale, suggesting a maximum around 8. The fracturing of the earth suggests a minimum of 6.\n* Fujita: Given the image, this is not a 5 on the tornado scale, suggesting a maximum around 4. The severe damage to the building suggests a minimum of 3.\n* Scoville: This would then leave the rest for the Scoville scale. 55,000 divided by estimates of 8 and 3 would give around 1700 Scoville units, a normal value for poblano peppers (Scoville number between about 1000 and 2000). The other two numbers could also be smaller, requiring a higher Scoville rating to reach 55,000 through multiplication, but there are many hotter peppers to make up the difference, such as jalapeño peppers (2500 to 10,000 Scoville units) among others.\n\nIn the title text it is mentioned that buildings constructed from softer materials were damaged by chili pepper impacts [due] to the storm's high Richter-Fujita-Scoville-Mohs hardness rating. The {{w|Mohs scale}} is a scale for mineral hardness which ranges from 1 (e.g. talc) to 10 (diamond), with lower numbers being softer and higher numbers being harder. Chili peppers are strong in a spicy sense, but very soft on the Mohs scale, so if it was only the chilies that hit other buildings it would only be very soft material that would take any damage. Of course there would also be building material hitting nearby houses, thus they would do more damage than the chili, by an amount that would depend upon the relative hardness of the processing plant structure to that of other buildings. The former is frangible enough to have become dislodged from its structure, but may be just as brittle as it is ultimately abrasive, or is composed of thoroughly resilient pieces of material previously held in place by mortar or some other binding of insufficient adhesion or mechanical strength. From either point or failure (or both!), the wind-whipped cloud of debris might then indeed be able to scour more generally well-built structures nearby, even ones actually designed to withstand and absorb such winds/earth movements in their own right.\n\nA number, where the hardness of the materials hitting nearby buildings was taken into consideration, could have been given, adding a fourth number to consider in the scale, but no such number is provided.\n\nSimilar comics:\n* [[2950: Situation]] - several unlikely scenarios, all at once\n* [[1531: The BDLPSWDKS Effect]] - also a hybrid multi-disciplinary amalgam of measurements\n* [[1794: Fire]] - featuring a multiple-alarm fire in an alarm factory\n\n===Discussion: Is the title text missing a word?===\nThe title text might be missing the word \"due,\" or it might not be a typo; both scenarios are possible, but the meaning changes. \n\nSince it's impossible to say which scenario is correct, here are the implications of both.\n\n====Scenario 1: No missing word====\nThe sentence as written means that '''the chili peppers impacted the ''magnitude'' of the scale'''. In other words, buildings made of soft materials were damaged because the Richter-Fujita-Scoville-Mohs hardness rating was higher than it otherwise would have been as a result of the chili peppers. This suggests that spicier peppers are more likely to damage soft buildings. \n\nThe text has a somewhat awkward and unusual phrasing, if this was the intended meaning. If it was intended, Randall is presumably making a pun on the word impact, using it in an unusual way. Discussion about impacts from disasters usually talk about physical impacts, not impacts to abstract measurement systems, so the joke may be about this secondary kind of impact.\n\n====Scenario 2: Missing word====\n\"Buildings constructed from softer materials were damaged by chili pepper impacts '''due''' to the storm's high Richter-Fujita-Scoville-Mohs hardness rating.\"\n\nThe sentence with \"due\" means that soft buildings were damaged by chili peppers, since the storm's hardness rating was high enough. This seems more straightforward: harder peppers successfully effacing soft building materials.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Close-up of Cueball, a news anchor, next to an image with a headline above it to the left of him. The image shows of black tornado descending from sky-cover above. It is striking a building that has been damaged near where the tornado hits. Two large chilies can be seen flying through the air in the foreground, with pieces of the building and more chilies flying off further away. Straight beneath the building and going up in the middle of it there is a crack, that divides into three inside the building. The ground is also higher to the right of the point where the crack enters the building. Cueball is speaking which is shown above the image and him.]\n:Headline: Breaking news\n:Cueball: A tornado that struck a chili pepper processing plant during an earthquake was rated 55,000 on the Richter-Fujita-Scoville scale.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:News anchor]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Earthquakes]]"
