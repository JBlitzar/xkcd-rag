'I was actually asleep; I woke up when I refreshed the webite and saw the news.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] asks [[Megan]] what's up, and Megan announces that there's a Compulsive Phone Checking Championship, presumably an award for the person who checks their phone the most often. Megan checks her phone to see if the winner has been announced, but finds the site's server is overloaded, which would be exactly what would happen if many people were checking their phones simultaneously. Given the nature of the contest, we can presume this is indeed the case. As a solution, Megan tries refreshing repeatedly, sending more load to the server and, thus, making it unavailable longer.\n\nThis compulsive behavior predates the popularity of mobile phones as shown in [[477: Typewriter]] and [[862: Let Go]].\n\nAnother possible analysis is that the site was purposely down, and instead was the contest itself, to see how many times different users would refresh the page within a time period, or perhaps to the last one standing, determining the winner.\n\nThe title text implies that Megan checks her phone so compulsively she even does it in her sleep. This probably contributed to her victory. A \"webite\" is probably either a typo of \"website\" or a pinned tab in a web browser.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball approaching Megan.]\n:Cueball: What's up?\n:Megan: They're announcing the winner of the compulsive phone-checking championship.\n\n:[Megan checks her phone.]\n\n:[Megan puts her phone away.]\n\n:[Megan checks her phone again.]\n:Cueball: Did you win?\n:Megan: Site's down.\n:Cueball: Weird.\n:Megan: I'll keep refreshing.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Phones]]"
