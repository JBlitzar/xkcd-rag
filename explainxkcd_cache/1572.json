The questions range from mundane typical survey questions such as “Do you have any food allergies?”, to rather strange, such as “Fill this text box with random letters by randomly mashing keys on your leopard.” (See [[1530: Keyboard Mash]] and [[1031: s/keyboard/leopard/]]).\n\nThe stated goal of the survey is to “create an interesting and unusual data set for people to play with”. A strange data set is a ripe opportunity for a sampling of readers. It's also supposed to be “a search for weird correlations” – presumably the goal is to be able to say things like “people who have been skydiving are (more/less) likely than average to dislike cilantro”. (See also [[882: Significant]] about finding presumably spurious correlations between unrelated data.)\n\n{{w|Image_map#Client-side_image_map|HTML image maps}} is a technique for marking up areas of an image on a web page, such that each area can be a link without the whole image being a link. [[Randall]] could have used this type of image map to make only the “Click here to take the survey” button be a link, and none of the rest of the image. But he cannot get the hang of it (or knowing his skills, does not wish to take the time to learn it). Not getting the hang of HTML image maps was also referenced on the banner for his [[Header text#2014-07-23_-_what_if.3F_book_tour|book tour]] for the first ''[[What If? (book)|What If?]]'' book. See the link for other instances where he mentions this problem in the [[Header text|header text]].\n\nThe title text is a joke off of {{w|Big Data}}, which is a name for analysis of a set of data that includes a huge amount of information. He also says \"for a big planet\" because the Earth is big.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe survey is now closed, and the questions were replaced by the text:\n:The xkcd survey is now closed. Thank you for all your answers! Response data is being collected and will be posted soon.\n\nTo this day, the data has never been released, and there is no indication of when the data is intended to be made public.[https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/40mhve/what_ever_happened_to_the_survey_we_took/ According to a Reddit user], Randall crashed Google Forms, so the data took much longer to be retrieved. This is similar to his breaking of [http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/62/balloon_wolfram.png Wolfram Alpha] while answering a reader's question on his  ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' blog.\n\n==The survey==\n{{TOC}}A recreation of the survey can be found [https://goo.gl/forms/CtAILwjyJAYsmqbO2 here on Google]. The recreation's raw data can be [https://goo.gl/5A77ZX found in this spreadsheet]. Note that the order of the possible answers (the list of possibilities) was random and thus changed every time the page was reloaded. The survey started with the following statement:\n\n:<nowiki>This is an anonymous survey. After it's done, a database of everyone's responses will be posted.\nThere's no specific reason for any of the questions. The goal is to create an interesting and unusual data set for people to play with. This is obviously not going to be a real random sample of people, but in the interest of getting cooler data, if you're sharing this with friends, try sending it to some people who wouldn't normally see this kind of thing!</nowiki>\n\n:WARNING<nowiki>: This survey is anonymous, but your answers WILL BE MADE PUBLIC. Depending what you write, it's possible that someone may be able to identify you by looking at your responses.
