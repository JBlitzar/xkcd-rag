It is almost identical to [[2036: Edgelord]], only different text, and has the same setting as [[2654: Chemtrails]], except there it is [[Ponytail]] that gets annoyed.\n\nIn all of these comics, modern slang terms or just commonly used words are used to describe jobs or ideas, and while the slang or word seems accurate if taken literally, it isn't normally used in that context. A graph theory Ph.D. was labeled an \"edgelord\", a reference to mathematical graphs having edges, trails of ant pheromones were labeled as \"chemtrails\", a reference to pheromones being chemicals, and scientific hypotheses were referred to as \"fan theories.\" \n\nThis time a turbine maintenance engineer is described as doing a lot of fanservice, as in literally servicing fans (with which turbines are often inaccurately conflated). A second order of dissonance is introduced from the difference between fans and turbines, which work oppositely: fans use energy to propel a fluid, while turbines use a flowing fluid to generate energy. [[Randall]] has previously touched on wind turbines ''not'' being fans, most notably in [[1378: Turbine]].\n\n{{wiktionary|fanservice|Fanservice}} is a term used to describe decisions made in fictional media, usually TV or film productions, that are intended to make the fans happy. The term is sometimes derogatory as it implies some degree of pandering to the fans over finishing the story, and in such cases can be incredibly distracting. It can just mean inserting obscure details of the work's back-history, to spark gleeful recognition among the more devoted fans, but it most often refers to the inclusion of titillating scenes &mdash; the {{tvtropes|MsFanservice|Ms. Fanservice}} trope where female characters routinely wear form-fitting outfits is a good example.\n\nIn the title text, Randall refers to HVAC (a term for the unified <u>H</u>eating, <u>V</u>entilation, and <u>A</u>ir <u>C</u>onditioning systems of a given building) as \"the fandom.\" Normally, \"fandom\" means the group of fans of something, but here refers to a domain that uses lots of fans. Randall tells that he was thrown out of his architectural engineering program because ''I wouldn't stop referring to HVAC as \"the fandom.\"'' This is related to the many [[:Category:Banned from conferences|conferences he says he has been banned from]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is talking to White Hat, who has his hands balled into fists and has small lines above his head to indicate he is yelling his response back at Cueball.]\n:Cueball: So, I hear you do a lot of fanservice.\n:White Hat: '''''No!'''''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:How to annoy a turbine maintenance engineer\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Engineering]]\n[[Category:How to annoy]]"
