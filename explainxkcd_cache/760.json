In the original the dwarves, hunting for the precious metal mithril dug so deep that they awoke a {{w|Balrog}} — a {{w|Maiar in Middle-earth|Maia}} corrupted by {{w|Morgoth|Melkor}}. {{w|Gandalf}} is telling about the story to four hobbits standing next to him. One of the {{w|hobbits}} has apparently read ''The Lord of the Rings'', because he asks if the dwarves \"awoke a terror of shadow  and flame\", but then Gandalf says that they were merely trapped in their hole and couldn't get out.\n\nHowever, Gandalf's final line may be a hint that the comic's version is closer to the original than it appears — in the story, the adventuring party discovers a journal of the last dwarves to occupy Moria. The last page starts ominously: \"We cannot get out. We cannot get out.\" That memorable sentence is used again near the end of the page as the impending final orcish attack is described by the now-dead dwarves, and repeated by {{w|Gimli}} as they reflect on the terrible news, lending a much darker tone to the comic's punchline.\n\nThe title text suggests a mundane solution to their problem — a long ladder. The Endless Stair was a very long staircase from the lowest dungeon up to the top of the mountain above Moria: the title text suggests that the dwarves should have constructed that prior to entering the depths.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A far shot of Gandalf the Grey and the four hobbits standing in a dark, underground city.]\n:Gandalf: Behold, Khazad-Dûm; the Dwarrowdelf; the mines of Moria -- once the greatest and mightiest city of the dwarves.\n\n:[Full body shot of Gandalf.]\n:Gandalf: But the dwarves delved too greedily.\n\n:[Close-up on Gandalf.]\n:Gandalf: And too deep.\n\n:[Full shot of the hobbits and Gandalf.]\n:Hobbit: ...and awoke a terror of shadow and flame?\n:Gandalf: No. They couldn't get out.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:LOTR]]"
