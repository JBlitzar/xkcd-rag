In this comic, the three kids are taking this game too seriously (and in a nerdy way), causing great damage to the house with what appears to be a garden hose and some dynamite. Stopping a lava flow by diverting it into an artificial trench or cooling the flow with (sea)water are both tactics that have been used in the past  [https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/news/volcano-watch-can-hawaiian-lava-flows-be-diverted with varying success].\n\nThe title text refers to events like the 2010 eruptions at {{w|Eyjafjallaj√∂kull}}, the ash clouds of which caused the shutdown of most of Europe's {{w|IFR}} airspace. The first joke there is that grounding a child often means to consign them to their bedroom for a set period of hours (as a punishment), whereas grounding a plane means to disallow any use of that plane for an extended period of time. The most notable example of this is {{w|Concorde}}, which has been indefinitely grounded. The second joke is that causing panic and diverting a large number of flights would cause lots of financial damage, and would normally be subject to more punishment than simply giving the kids a time-out.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three Cueball-like kids are in a living room. Furniture and other things are knocked over, broken, or tilted. The first kid is holding a handle of a plunger with cables going offscreen.]\n:First Kid: I've dynamited a trench through the kitchen to divert flow!\n:'''BOOM'''\n\n:[The second kid is aiming a hose at the floor.]\n:Second Kid: More hoses! We need to cool and solidify the surface layer!\n:''FWOOSH''\n\n:[The third kid is standing on a chair, using a cell phone or radio.]\n:Third Kid: Where are the damn helicopters?\n\n:[Caption beneath the panel:]\n:Like many kids, we sometimes pretended the floor was lava.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n<!-- [[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]] *If* true (and child-'Cueball's count, which they haven't previously tended to), this instead features Multiple Cueballs.
