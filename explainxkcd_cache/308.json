The quote also provides the title of the {{w|Terry Pratchett}} novel {{w|Interesting Times}}, which takes place in a fictional counterpart of China.\n\n[[Cueball]] is shown here as an office worker, a job that, to most people, is the opposite of interesting. This is contrasted with [[Megan]], who is rappelling down the outside of his office building, for no apparent reason other than because she can, and inviting him on an adventure. This contrast is amplified by the usage of \"interesting\" colors for the outside in comparison to the \"dull\" gray for the inside of the building. Things are bound to get at least one kind of \"interesting\" very fast.\n\nThe title text refers to a {{w|Category 6 cable|Cat6}} cable, which is more commonly known as Ethernet cable. It would be easily found in an office building, since it is used to connect computers to a network. Its usefulness as a {{w|climbing harness}} is indeterminate.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[On the left hand side of the panel is a cutaway of several floors of an office, in gray. On the right side, a blue sky with clouds,  and green hills below. Hanging from a cable is Megan, clearly having rappelled down the side of the building, next to a Cueball at his desk, who is looking at Megan.]\n:Megan: You know how some people consider \"May you have an interesting life\" to be a curse?\n:Cueball: Yeah...\n:Megan: Fuck those people. Wanna have an adventure?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
