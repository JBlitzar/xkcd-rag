The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The [[Header text|header text]] also [[Header text#2022-09-13 - What if? 2 is available now|changed that day]] to shout out that the book was released on that day. (It had been counting down the last week, from [[Header text#2022-09-07 - Less than one week to What if? 2 comes out|less than a week]], [[Header text#2022-09-12 - Three days to What if? 2 comes out|three days]] and [[Header text#2022-09-12 - One day to What if? 2 comes out|one day]] while the previous comics [[2670: Interruption]] and [[2671: Rotation]] was on the front page â€” the latter only for one day due to the Tuesday release).\n\nWhile announcing that his '''What If? 2''' book is finally out (the entire comic is a [https://xkcd.com/whatif2 link] to the books page on xkcd), Randall gives us a flowchart we can follow to find an article in the book relating to the situation in the flowchart. Once a relevant possibility is reached in the flowchart a page number in the book is given. It thus assumes the reader plans to do something that the advice in '''What If 2''' could be helpful for, which hopefully is highly unlikely. See the [[#Table of questions in the flowchart|table below]] for explanations on the individual options in the flowchart.\n\nThe title text refers to the loop near the bottom of the flowchart, which involves a series of questions asking if the reader wants a progressively larger number of dogs. The number of dogs offered increases several times, and if that is sufficient the flowchart ends with fulfillment. Eventually it will have an option for the scenario where all in the universe is consumed by dogs, which directs to page 308 of the book. The title text references this last option by assuring the reader that all of the dogs are doing fine, but goes on to state that in itself could cause problems. For instance, those dogs could impede the progress of all life on Earth and elsewhere and/or reproduce and create an even larger population of dogs.\n\n==Table of questions in the flowchart==\nThe flowchart questions and their possible answers are described in the following table(Also in [[2672: What If? 2 Flowchart/Table]]):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
