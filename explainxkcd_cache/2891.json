The odd part about it is the right half, which appears to be infinitely recursive copies of the building, a self-similar {{w|fractal}}. The house as a whole represents a {{w|golden rectangle}} with a side ratio of the {{w|golden ratio}} (Φ =(1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.6180339887...), with successively smaller living areas (further subdivided into rooms, to a common but shrunken and rotated plan) being square adjoined by a golden-rectangle of all smaller living areas in the manner of the areas defined by the classic {{w|Golden spiral}} diagram. The joke is that Randall is intentionally conflating the word \"log\" in the common phrase \"log cabin,\" where \"log\" refers to the wood the cabin is made of, with a {{w|logarithmic spiral}}, as \"log\" is shorthand for \"logarithmic\".\n\nEvery square subunit of the premises consists of a main combined kitchen/lounge area, with an adjoining shower-equipped bathroom, and a hallway leading to a closet and two bedrooms (a double-bed one with en-suite bath-equipped bathroom, and another with a single bed; both having their own walk-in closet space). Between the kitchen and the dining table is the open doorway that serves as the entry into the next inwards level of the floorplan.\n\nA visitor can also walk in a spiral by using the open doorways in the building plan.\n\nIn the title text, Randall says that he is confident that building inspectors will approve the design of his log cabin, assuming they can escape. As one moves deeper into the infinite spiral of architecture, the entire log cabin ''seems'' to be a denser labyrinth of rooms and hallways.\n\nIt is unknown how the inspectors lost in the inner rooms would shrink in the same ratio, and would only have to head out through the last doorway they walked in through (or two, if they're currently in the en-suite) and then exit each 'main' area in turn until they exited the building itself. If they have any trouble at all (other than rescaling themselves), it would be that there is ''always'' a further inward area that they might consider needs exploring to fulfil their inspection routine. This construction could imply folded spacetime. To perform a correct inspection, the inspectors might need sufficient relation that inner rooms are identical to the outer rooms, and to solve algebraic equations for various parameters.\n\nIt could have been that the repetition continued outside of what is drawn here, continuing to grow larger as it moves further out, except that only the top-level external entry has a door: the entries to each lower level only have open doorways marked with no door, and except for the clear marking of external windows on the first four iterations, with no internal ones (and therefore no equivalent windows on the subsequent iterations) precludes that possibility. In fact, the first iteration has windows on the 'southern' edge for the single bedroom and seating area, for which there are no equivalents on any of the other iterations.\n\n[https://www.generations-quilt-patterns.com/log-cabin-quilt-block.html Log Cabin] is also a classic quilting block, which starts with a tiny square and spirals outwards.\n\n==Transcript==\n: [Plan view of a multiroom house or cabin, in the manner of an architectural drawing. The overall outline is a rectangle, with an aspect ratio of approximately 1:1.6. On the left side, five rooms — an open-plan kitchen/living/dining room, two bedrooms, and two bathrooms — form a perfect square taking up part of the overall rectangular outline. In the remaining rectangular part to the right, the top, square part is taken up by a copy of those five rooms, slightly smaller and rotated 90 degrees clockwise. In the bottom part of that part, the right-hand part is a second copy, smaller and rotated again. In the left-hand part, the bottom part is a third copy, smaller and rotated again. In the top part, the left-hand part is a fourth copy. And so on. It is clear that there is an infinite number of copies of the basic five-room plan, spiraling logarithmically inwards to infinity.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel]:\n: Log cabin\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Engineering]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
