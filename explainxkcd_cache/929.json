As of 2019, it seems that Facebook has successfully held its position as the Default Social Network™, while Google Plus was a colossal blunder for Google and was finally sunset for consumers in April 2019.\nThe two players seem to have a disagreement over this. One player states that it would be ridiculous to expect everyone to move to Plus. The other player denies the notion that they have to, stating that he values his personal preference over conformity. He supports this idea by saying that his mother still uses {{w|AOL}} and other people continue using {{w|IRC}} and that if each time a new dominant social network emerged and everyone switched to it, neither of these things would stick around.\n\nThey are interrupted when they pass the ball to [[Black Hat]], who immediately shoots it with a crossbow bolt. Their arguments and rather intelligent discussion are derailed by the absurdity of Black Hat's reaction, which is both humorous and puts the issue in stark contrast.\n\nBlack Hat neither joins in the discussion nor does he participate in the game. It seems that any offer to participate in either is met with a blunt and clear denial. He is simply not a conformist.\n\nA possible explanation for the joke is that while tech geeks or Google enthusiasts might discuss whether the world will move from Facebook to Plus, a number of people might simply ignore the debate and \"shoot\" the discussion dead by just ignoring the existence of anything that isn't Facebook. Or even that of Facebook itself; Blackhat's attention appears to be on a phone, at least before and after having loosed the crossbow bolt, but there's no obvious clue here as to what he actually uses it for/with, at the time of this comic.\n\nIn the title text, Black Hat continues to provide an example of his tendency to play by his own rules. A clay pigeon is a clay disc that is thrown into the air and serves as a target on a {{w|skeet shooting}} range. Participants are expected to shoot the pigeons with a shotgun but Black Hat would rather capture the clay pigeons and shoot them from a very close range. (This is made even more humorous by the excellent crossbow skills he shows in the comic.) This practice eventually got him expelled from the shooting range. It is unclear whether Black Hat was good at shooting clay pigeons from farther away.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cueball-like guys are playing basketball. The right guy (Cueball) attempts to throw the basketball through the hoop, but it bounces off down to his friend. To the right Black Hat has his back to the other two while he is looking at his phone.]\n:Friend: Do you seriously think ''everyone'' will move to Plus? It was hard enough getting them on Facebook.\n\n:[The friend has caught the rebound and now passes the basketball back to Cueball. Black Hat is not shown.]\n:Cueball: Do they have to?\n:Cueball: My mom still uses AOL—it doesn't mean my social life has to happen there.\n\n:[Only Cueball is shown. He passes the basketball to the right towards the off-panel Black Hat.]\n:Cueball: Universal adoption isn't everything. I mean, IRC is still—\n\n:[Zoom in on the basketball as a crossbow bolt pierces the ball, forming a slight depression.]\n:''Thunk''\n\n:[Cueball looks to Black Hat who has a crossbow in one hand, he is still looking at the phone in his other hand. The ball with the arrow lies between them.]\n:Cueball: You're not really the \"catch\" type, are you?\n:Black Hat: I am not.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Google Plus]]\n[[Category:Basketball]]\n[[Category:Crossbows]]\n[[Category:Sport]] <!-- The other sport mentioned being skeet shooting -->"
