Some real life examples are the antonyms 'high-low', 'rigid-flowing', and 'tiny-huge'. This is partly due to humans' needs to {{w|Cognitive categorization|categorize things}}.\n\nThe comic intentionally conflates this with the {{w|Phase transition|phase transition}} that water undergoes around 0 degrees Celsius. Water in its liquid state can be described as soft and round, as can the sound of the word \"water\" itself. In contrast, ice is hard and crystalline, giving it the potential to form hard edges and sharp points. The word \"ice\" also contains a sharp hissing sound.\n\nIn the above-freezing section of the graph, there are pictures associated with the following (bouba) words: drop, drip, pour, splash. In the below-freezing section of the graph, the pictures are associated with the following (kiki) words: ice, icicle, snowflake, ice cube, iceberg.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|ice spike|ice spikes}}, which are caused by the uneven freezing of ice in a freezer. The title text expands on the joke by claiming that ice cubes wish to maintain the pointiness of objects characterized as \"kiki.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A vertical graph is shown, indicating temperature in degrees Celsius, with a horizontal dotted line at zero degrees and positive temperatures above it. The graph has labels against gradation marks for -10, -5, 0, 5 and 10 °C, a mark for each other whole degree present and extends to meet the top and bottom border of the graph's frame, at approximately ±11.5°C. The area above the dotted line is filled with several illustrations of liquid water in various forms: dripping down from a surface, forming a droplet, pouring from a glass, splashing onto a surface of water, etc. This area is labeled \"Bouba\" with an arrow pointing up. The area below the dotted line is filled with illustrations of ice in various forms, namely icicles hanging from a surface, two ice cubes (one with a small ice spike), a snowflake, a thin piano-shaped piece of ice and a thicker sheet of ice on water along with an iceberg. This area is labeled \"Kiki\" with an arrow pointing down.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:When water's temperature falls below 0°C, it undergoes a phase transition from bouba to kiki.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category: Charts]]\n[[Category: Language]]\n[[Category: Physics]]"
