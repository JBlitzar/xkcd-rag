In the US, a teaspoon is defined as 4.9 ml (0.18 imp fl oz; 0.17 US fl oz) while a tablespoon is defined as 14.8 ml (0.50 US fl oz; 3 tsp).\n\nIt also plays a joke on metric prefixes (based on powers of 10) versus binary prefixes (based on powers of 2), which are also a common source of confusion (see also [[394: Kilobyte]]). In the International System of Units (SI), T (for ''tera-'') signifies a multiplier of 10<sup>12</sup> (that is, 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000), while Ti (''tebi-'', for ''terabinary''), and not Tb, is an ISO standard binary prefix meaning 2<sup>40</sup> (that is, 1024<sup>4</sup> = 1&nbsp;099&nbsp;511&nbsp;627&nbsp;776).\n\nIf \"spoon\" is understood as US teaspoon, then one teraspoon will be 4&nbsp;928&nbsp;922 cubic meters (1.302 billion US gallons or 3996 acre-feet) and a binary teraspoon will be 5&nbsp;419&nbsp;407 cubic meters (1.432 B gal or 4394 acre-ft). If the US tablespoon is taken as base unit, a teraspoon will be 14&nbsp;786&nbsp;765 cubic meters and a binary teraspoon 16&nbsp;258&nbsp;220 cubic meters – roughly equivalent to six thousand Olympic-size swimming pools or slightly more than six times the volume of the Pyramid of Giza. All these units have fairly limited uses in cooking.{{Citation needed}} \n\nThe title text is a play on a lyric from the Alanis Morissette song \"{{w|Ironic (song)|Ironic}}\": \"It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife.\" Randall changes the line to \"teraspoon\" and \"kilonife\". The \"kilonife\" comes from ''knife'' being interpreted as \"nife\" with a ''k'' prefix – ''k'' being the SI symbol for ''kilo-'' –, in a similar vein as taking ''tsp'' for \"teraspoon\". \"Nife\" is a geophysical name for Earth's core, thought to be composed of nickel and iron, and hence the word comes from the chemical symbols Ni (nickel) and Fe (iron).\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:Cooking tips: tsp vs tbsp\n:[left column:]\n:<big>Tsp</big>\n:Teraspoon \n:1,000,000,000,000 \n:(10<sup>12</sup>) spoons\n\n:[right column:]\n:<big>Tbsp</big>\n:Binary tsp \n:1,099,511,627,776 \n:(1024<sup>4</sup>) spoons\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Tips]]\n[[Category:Binary]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Songs]]"
