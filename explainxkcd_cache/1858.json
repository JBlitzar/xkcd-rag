Since they don't have mouths, they just kinda toss them in the air and let them fall back down into their propeller blades.

This comic claims to show the timeline of different activities that are used to celebrate the holiday. One common activity is to watch fireworks displays. With the rise of personal drones there have been several videos of fireworks from drones, including flying the drones through the middle of the display. The comic then purports that starting in the year it was published (2017), fireworks and drones will be at some sort of war with each other, starting with drone pilots leading their drones into the path of the rising fireworks before they explode, leading to fireworks technicians intentionally trying to strike down drones. In 2019, [[Randall]] posits that the drones will be weaponized with fireworks and competitions will be held to shoot down your opponents' drone. This wanton destruction of drones leads them to turn against their pilots and humanity in 2020 (after gaining sentience, presumably by their AI evolving through the competition), and then in 2021, they will be celebrating their Independence Day from the humans. As of March 16, 2025, drones have not yet overthrown humans.{{Citation needed}}\n\nDespite the many unfortunate events that happened in 2020, sentient firework-armed drones overthrowing humans was not one of them.{{Citation needed}} \n\nThe title text refers to another popular 4th of July activity in the United States: Barbecues with fare such as hot dogs and hamburgers. But since the drones don't have mouths or a digestive tract, they simply make a mess by using their rotors as a blender.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[One single panel is shown.
