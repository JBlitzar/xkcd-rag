It is typically used through the text-based terminal, using cryptic single-letter arguments such as \"<code>tar -cvf archive.tar *</code>\". Many Unix executables are distributed via tar archives; as a result tar files would be encountered by Unix users as commonly as Windows users encounter EXE files. Depending on the flavor of Unix, the order of the flags, or the exclusion of the hyphen, could render the command incorrect, which would either throw up an error or worse, cause one to accidentally overwrite or delete important files.\n\nThe comic alludes to the fact that, despite years of use of the command, it is incredibly hard to remember what the letters stand for without looking them up, such as with Google. The joke here is that a \"tar\" command with perfect syntax on the first try without outside help is such a daunting task that even [[Rob]] can't overcome it with confidence, and apologizes for not being able to prevent their imminent death.\n\nThe title text points out that while much of computing changes very quickly, the tar program, which is very old (originating ca. 1975), is still around and heavily used. [[Randall]] points out the paradox that after 15 years he is still unable to write out a proper tar command from memory, yet at the same time he feels that he shouldn't ''have'' to and a newer, better tool really should have come along already.\n\nOne could also interpret the scenario as a pun on \"{{w|tarbomb}},\" a poorly created tar archive that, when extracted, dumps a load of files into the current directory that the user has to clean up.\n\nIn [[208: Regular Expressions]] [[Cueball]] saves the day by knowing {{w|regular expression}}s, although in the title text it is alluded to how easy these may also miss a character.\n\nRob may refer to {{w|Rob Pike}}, who was a member of the team at AT&T who created Unix.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and White Hat stand next to a nuclear bomb. The bomb has a hatch open on top, and a small blinking screen. The two people are shouting off-screen.]\n:Megan: Rob! \n:Megan: You use Unix!\n:White Hat: Come quick!\n\n:[Megan, White Hat, and Rob look at the screen on the bomb. Rob peers closely. The screen is on the bomb, but is shown at the top of the panel in black with white letters, except \"tar\" and the last underscore which is in gray and \"ten\" which is black but written in a white box. The text reads:]\n\n<div style=\"background-color:black; padding:5px; width:fit-content; margin-left: 2em\">\n<font color=\"white\">To disarm the bomb,<br>simply enter a valid<br></font><font color=\"gray\">''<tt>tar</tt>''</font> <font color=\"white\">command on your<br>first try. No Googling.<br>You&nbsp;have&nbsp;</font><code><font color=\"black\">ten</font></code>&nbsp;<font color=\"white\">seconds.<br>~# </font> <font color=\"gray\">_</font> \n</div>\n\n:[They all stand in the same position, but without the text displayed. Beat panel.]\n\n:[Still in the same position but White Hat becomes impatient.]\n:White Hat: ...Rob?\n:Rob: I'm so sorry.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Rob]]\n[[Category:Google Search]]\n[[Category:Programming]]\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:Nuclear weapons]]"
