The previous fools comic was [[880: Headache]] from Friday April 1st 2011. The next was [[1193: Externalities]] released on Monday April 1st 2013. The most recent was [[2916: Machine]]\n\nAn {{w|Umwelt}}, as the title text explains, is the idea that a person's entire way of thinking is dependent on their surroundings. Thus, this April Fools' Day comic changes based on the browser, location, or referrer. Thus what the viewer is viewing the comic on, where they live or where they came from determines which comic they actually see. As a result, there are actually multiple comics that went up on April Fools' Day, although only one is seen.\n(The term 'Umwelt,' as mentioned in the comic, refers to the semiotic theories of Jakob von Uexküll and Thomas A. Sebeok)\n\nInformation about how the wide variety of data was collected and credit for the viewers who contributed can be found [https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/rnst4/april_fools_xkcd_changing_comic/ here].\n\n===The Void===\n[[File:umwelt the void.jpg]]\n\nIf the device or browser you are using does not support Javascript, you will simply see a static image of a white swirl on a dark background.\n\nPossible reference to The Ring (https://imgur.com/wlGmm), as though to suggest that using an alternative browser is dismal and horrific.\n\nDavean (xkcd's sysadmin): \"[This] comic isn't available everywhere and it can come up i[n] some situation[s] only for recognized browsers.\"{{Actual citation needed}}\n\nBrowser: Alternative Browser\n\n===Aurora===\n[[File:umwelt aurora.png|800px]]\n\nOne could interpret that since [[Megan]] didn't go out and therefore missed seeing the {{w|Aurora}} (northern lights), [[Knit Cap]] lied about it. That way, Megan wouldn't have felt sad that she missed out. Another interpretation could be that she decides that since Megan did not even bother to go outside to see such a spectacular sight she will not tell her about it. And yet another could be that she did not think it was interesting.\n\nKnit Cap could possibly also be red-green colorblind, seeing the green aurorae as grey \"clouds\". This would serve as an example for the theme of the comic, as a non-colorblind person and a colorblind person seeing the same color would perceive it differently, one seeing it as its true color, and the other seeing it without the shade of color they cannot see. If this is the case, then it would be a reference to umwelt, as Knit Cap would be living in a world where the auroras do not reach his location.\n\nIn real life, [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-northern-lights-dont-look-anything-like-they-do-in-photos_n_5500a4d9e4b0e62d0dd4f9bb aurorae are usually seen as grey/white clouds] to the naked eye, as our eyes cannot perceive the \"greener\" colors as well in the dark.\n\nThis image changed based on the size of the browser window including different panels at different sizes.\n\nLocations: Canada, Boston, Indiana, Maine, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Minnesota< Norway, Denmark, France, Ireland, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Seoul (Safari), London (on Firefox), China (on Firefox and Safari), Finland (Uses \"Canada\")<!--At 15/08/2024 21:43 local-->. Also in Virginia, but using Ohio in the first panel; in Wisconsin, Maryland and the Philippines, but using Canada in the first panel; in Marion, Illinois, but using Canada in the first panel along with the phrase \"as far south as us\" in the first panel, and in Utah, also using the phrase \"as far south as us\", same with Colombia, Spain, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Washington State, and California.\n\nIn [[1302: Year in Review]] a possibly different Megan has a completely different approach to the chance of seeing northern lights, as that was the only event she was looking forward to in 2013, and it failed. If this is the same Megan, perhaps she learned that there actually were northern lights in her area from another source, and so desperately wanted to have another chance to see them.\n\n===Snake===\n[[File:umwelt snake composite 1024.png|850px]]\n[[:File:umwelt snake composite.png|Full size]]\n\nThe joke here is the extreme length of snakes. The world's longest living snake is the {{w|reticulated python}}, the longest ever measuring over 22 feet (6.95 meters). The blue and orange circles refer to the hit game {{w|Portal}}.\nThere is also a reference to the book \"The Little Prince\" in the second panel, where there is a large bulge in the snake that looks like an elephant. The Little Prince starts out by mentioning a drawing that the author made when he was six that showed an elephant inside a snake.\n\nAlso, the number and content of the panels changes depending on the size of your browser window.\n\nThis image changed based on the size of the browser window including different panels at different sizes.\n\nSpecific AltText for this image: Umwelt is the idea that because their senses pick up on different things, different animals in the same ecosystem actually live in very different worlds. Everything about you shapes the world you inhabit -from your ideology to your glasses prescription to your browser window size.\n\nLocation: Texas (on Chrome Version 33.0.1750.154 m), New Jersey, California (on Chrome Version 39.0.2171.95), Maryland, Massachusetts (Safari for iOS, Chrome version 49.0.2623.112), Connecticut (Safari for iOS, Chrome Version 73.0.3683.103, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge), Virginia (on Chrome), Michigan (Firefox v46.0.1), Penang (Chrome Version 65.0.3325.162), London (Microsoft Edge), Spain/Barcelona (on Brave) Germany (on Opera One (version: 106.0.4998.70)), Fruita, Colorado (on Chrome for Android version 123.0.6312.80), China (Chrome and Edge), Australia (Chrome, version 137.0.7151.56, but only in guest mode).\n\n===Black Hat===\n[[File:umwelt tortoise 1024.png|850px]]\n[[:File:umwelt tortoise.png|Full size]]\n\nCueball as an analyst attempts to psychoanalyze [[Black Hat|Black Hat's]] [[72: Classhole|classhole]] tendencies. Cueball's quote and the whole setup is a direct reference to the movie {{w|Blade Runner}} (1982) and Black Hat is taking the Voight-Kampff test which is used to identify replicants from real humans.\n\nBlack Hat's reason for not helping the tortoise is that ''it '''knows''' what it did'' and thus in Black Hat's world view it deserves being turned over. The final part of the joke is that when zooming out it turns out that there is a tortoise behind Black Hat and he has actually already turned it over for what it did.\n\nLocation: Seems to appear mostly in \"other countries\" — those without location-specific comics.\n\n===Too Quiet===\n[[File:umwelt too quiet 1024.png|850px]]\n[[:File:umwelt too quiet.png|Full size]]\n\nA reference to {{w|Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park}} which has been [[87: Velociraptors|constantly]] [[135: Substitute|referred]] [[1110: Click and Drag|to]] [[155: Search History|before]] [[758: Raptor Fences|in]] this comic.\n\nAlso referencing the film {{w|2 Fast 2 Furious|2 Fast 2 Furious}}, an entertaining, yet intellectually unprovoking sequel in a popular film franchise, which is aimed at teenagers and young adults, prompting the blunt response from the stickman. The fact that Steve would use such a cliché {{w|2000s (decade)|noughties}} movie term in such an intense moment, and the subsequent curse, is the joke in this comic.\n\nLocation: short version — iPhone 5c Safari browser in Texas, iPhone 5 Chrome Browser in Minnesota, long version - Google Chrome browser in Indiana, Windows 8 Laptop\n\n===Pond===\n[[File:umwelt pond mobile.png]][[File:umwelt pond wide.png]]\n\nTwo different versions showed, the narrower version for mobile devices.\n\nLocation: The Netherlands and various other countries.\n\n===Galaxies===\n[[File:umwelt galaxies 1024.jpg|850px]]\n[[:File:umwelt galaxies.jpg|Full size]]\n\nMegan is distracted from her conversation with [[Cueball]] by realizing that the space behind his head, from her vantage point, contains millions of galaxies. This is similar to an [https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/astro/hst_deep_field.jpg incredible photograph] taken by the Hubble Telescope, in which a tiny dark area of space in fact contained numerous galaxies.\n\nThe title text is an imaginative leap from this scenario: that the galaxies would be up to no good once Cueball is turned away from them.\n\nThis comic was only reported once... the intended environmental context is a mystery.\n\nLocation: unknown - sole report happened in Minnesota on Opera browser from a small ISP\n\n===xkcd Gold===\n[[File:umwelt xkcd gold.png]]\n\nThis is probably a reference to the 4chan Gold Account, an implementation on 4chan that does not actually exist, and is usually used to trick newcomers into revealing their credit card numbers. The joke is that \"Gold Account\" users can supposedly block other users from viewing images they have posted. The fifth panel is probably a reference to Beecock, a notorious set of shocker images. 4chan's moderators have been known to give out \"beecock bans\" or \"/z/ bans\" to particularly annoying users, which redirect the user to a page containing beecock and the text \"OH NO THE BOARD IS GONE\".\n\nReferrer: 4chan\n\n===Yo Mama===\n[[File:umwelt dog ballast.png]]\n\nPossible reference to Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s \"{{w|Harrison Bergeron}}.\"\n\nThe joke is that people's different experiences shape how they perceive the world in that the people who live in this world would perceive the joke as funny, while people in our world would not get it. This is the idea of umwelt mentioned at the top of the context where different individuals perceive the world differently.\n\nRefer: Facebook\n\n===Reddit===\n[[File:umwelt reddit.png]]\n\nReference to referencing, because Reddit, as a referring site, likes references to its referencing in its references.\n\nThis comic also features recursive imagery similar to [[688: Self-Description]] where the second panel embeds the entire comic within itself. (Except, conspicuously, the arrow indicating that it is \"You\" in the first panel.)\n\nOne of the browser tabs visible in the center panel is {{w|Elk}} on Wikipedia.\n\nReferrer: Reddit\n\n===Buns and Hot dogs===\n[[File:umwelt somethingawful.jpg]]\n\nThis is a reference to the question \"Why do hot dogs come in packages of 6 while buns come in packages of 8?\" \n\nAnother, more sexual reference to this question can be found in [[1641: Hot Dogs]].\n\nReferrer: SomethingAwful, Questionable Content, & MetaFilter\n\n===Twitter===\n[[File:umwelt twitter.jpg]]\n\nA summary of the \"content\" typically found on Twitter.\n\nIn the tweet feed, there are three tweets about some podcast on the top, followed by the tweet containing link they clicked on to get to the comic, tweets about Rob Delaney, unspecified passive-aggressive tweets, and a tweet from {{w|Horse_ebooks}} retweeted by one of the users the reader follows.\n\nOn the left, the topmost dialog, with profile information, shows that the user has posted 1,302 tweets, but only follows 171 people and has even fewer followers, at a measly 48. This is marked with a sad face, implying that the user wants more followers.\n\nBelow that is the \"who to follow\" dialog, which is written up as consisting of \"assholes\".\n\nBelow that is the \"trending tags\" dialog for the United States. It is full of tags about word games, tags about misogyny, and tags about Justin Bieber.\n\nBelow that is an unidentified dialog full of \"stuff your eyes automatically ignore\". And finally, on the bottom is the background color, which is \"a really pleasant blue\".\n\n\"Aggression\" is misspelled.\n\nReferrer: Twitter\n\n===Wikipedia===\n[[File:umwelt wikipedia wide.jpg]]\n[[File:umwelt wikipedia mobile.png]]\n\nThe term {{w|Mile High Club}} (or MHC) is a slang term applied collectively to individuals who have had sexual intercourse while on board an aircraft. Randall says that reading the news articles on it has distracted him from making that comic.\n\nTwo different versions shown, the narrower version (the single panel with all the text) for mobile devices.\n\nReferrer: Wikipedia\n\n===Google Chrome===\n[[File:umwelt chrome1.jpg]]\n\n{{w|Sergey Brin}} (born August 21, 1973) is an American computer scientist and Internet entrepreneur who, with Larry Page, co-founded Google, one of the most profitable Internet companies. As of 2013, his personal wealth was estimated to be $24.4 billion. Randall makes the joke that as the founder of Google, Brin's permission would be needed to use Google Chrome. Because there are millions of people who use Google, it is likely that at least some of the time Brin would be asleep, thus he would need to be woken.\n\nBrowser: Chrome\n\n===Chrome/Firefox===\n[[File:umwelt chrome2.png]]\n\nMozilla {{w|Firefox}} is a free and open-source web browser developed for Windows, OS X and Linux, with a mobile version for Android and iOS, by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Cueball is complaining about {{w|Google Chrome}}, to which [[Ponytail]] replies that there is an {{w|add-on}} that fixes what he is complaining about. When questioned, she replies that the add-on is Firefox, which isn't an add-on at all and is instead a different browser.\n\nBrowser: Chrome\n\n===Google Chrome-2===\n[[File:umwelt chrome3.png]]\n\nThis panel references Google Chrome's error screen, which shows a puzzle piece. The comic humorously implies that Chrome is looking for that piece. When completing jigsaw puzzles, a common strategy is to figure out where the pieces must be from their geometry rather than from the picture they create. In this case, the text suggests that Chrome believes the puzzle piece connects to the pieces which form one of the corners of the puzzle, which may seem impossible because any piece that links up to a corner would usually have at least one flat edge, which this piece has none. However, more complicated puzzles have complex shapes and are not always simply approximate squares with tabs and blanks.\n\nBrowser: Chrome or silk on desktop view\n\n===Mozilla Firefox Private Browsing===\n[[File:umwelt firefox incognito.png]]\n\nAnother reference to crashing web browsers.\nFirefox shows the history when it crashes.\n\nBrowser: Firefox (Incognito only?)\n\n===Internet Explorer===\n[[File:umwelt ie.png]]\n\nThis is yet another reference to crashing web browsers but instead, Internet Explorer has given up. It could be because there are too many sessions, they are shutting it down, or maybe it was too lazy to do anything.\n\nBrowser: Internet Explorer\n\n===Maxthon===\n[[File:umwelt maxthon.png]]\n\nBrowser: {{w|Maxthon}}\n\n===Netscape Navigator===\n[[File:umwelt netscape womanoctopus.png]]\n\n[[File:umwelt netscape man.png]]\n\n{{w|Netscape Navigator}} was a web browser popular in the 1990s.\n\nBrowser: Netscape\n\n===Rockmelt===\n[[File:umwelt rockmelt.png|850px]]\n\n{{w|Rockmelt}} is a social-media-based browser.\n\nReference to the gospel song {{w|Longing for Old Virginia: Their Complete Victor Recordings (1934)|\"There's no hiding place down here\" by The Carter Family}}, later covered by Stephen Stills.\n\n:I run to the rock just to hide my face\n:And the rocks cried out, no hiding place\n:There's no hiding place down here\n\nIt may additionally be a reference to the ''Babylon 5'' episode \"And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place,\" which featured the song.\n\nBrowser: Rockmelt\n\n===Plugin Disabled===\n[[File:umwelt plugin disabled.png]]\n\nWhen the Google Chrome web browser does not have the required software (called a plug-in) to display a web page's content, it displays a puzzle piece icon and an error message. In this case, Chrome informs the user that the content is impossible to display. \n\nBrowser: Plugin (?) Disabled, Safari Desktop\n\n===Corporate Networks===\n[[File:umwelt corporate general.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate amazon chrome.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate amazon firefox.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate amazon other.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate google chrome.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate microsoft chrome.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate microsoft firefox.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate microsoft other.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate nytimes chrome.png]]\n[[File:umwelt corporate nytimes other.png]]\n\nThese error messages appear if the user is on a network owned by one of the corporations noted. The error message includes a warning against speaking on the company's behalf.\n\nISP: Corporate networks of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, NY Times\n\n===Military===\n[[File:umwelt military.png]]\n\n[[Cueball]] assumes that anyone using a military network has an important job like watching for incoming missiles. He includes a thank-you to the user for their military service.\n\nISP: Military networks\n\n===T-Mobile===\n[[File:umwelt tmobile.png]]\n\nReference to T-Mobile's distinguishing feature (at the time it was written) of weaker coverage, in relation to other major providers.\n\nISP: T-Mobile\n\n===Verizon and AT&T===\n[[File:umwelt verizon.png]]\n\n[[File:umwelt att.png]]\n\nReference to Verizon and AT&T's scandals/controversy regarding implementation of bandwidth caps.\n\nISP: Verizon and AT&T\n\n===France===\n[[File:umwelt france.jpg|850px]]\n\nA common joke about France is that the nation does not win wars. This originated from France's annexation by Germany during World War II, and America's late entry into the war, which is sometimes portrayed humorously as a case of America 'saving' Europe, in this joke particularly France (the role of the French resistance is usually not mentioned), leading to a common American joke at the expense of France's military prowess [https://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/victories.html][https://politicalhumor.about.com/library/images/blpic-frenchmilitaryvictories.htm][https://politicalhumor.about.com/library/jokes/bljokefrenchmilitaryhistory.htm]. When France did not form part of the coalition that invaded Iraq in 2003, aligning with the many countries that condemned U.S. action, the joke was revived. \n\nA Google search of \"French Military Victories\" + 'I'm feeling lucky' used to direct to \"did you mean: french military defeats\" (due to a {{w|Google bomb}}). Cueball is trying to show this to his friend, who is French. However, his joke backfires, as his friend immediately points out that the stereotype of France not having military victories is undercut by the fact that one of the most innovative military commanders in history, Napoleon, was French by citizenship (though Italian/Corsican by culture, as the French annexed Corsica a few months before his birth to an Italian noble family), and in fact conquered much of Europe.\n\nFollowing the theme of umwelt, the comic highlights the two characters' differing perspectives: The American thinks that France is a military failure, while the Frenchman thinks of Napoleon.\n\nThe last line of the comic further implies that Cueball is not as smart as he thinks he is in regards to anything French, as he mispronounces the French loan word \"{{w|Touché (fencing)|touché}}\".\n\nLocations: France & Quebec\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:umwelt germany.png]]\n\nThis comic references the {{w|Berlin airlift#The start of the Berlin Airlift|Berlin Airlift}}, a relief measure for citizens in West Berlin (surrounded by East Germany) instituted by the Western Allies after World War II. In reality, the Western Allies flew a grand total of 500,000 tons of food over the Soviet blockade in planes. Randall puts a twist on this event by making it more fun: dropping supplies from a grand chairlift. The play on words is that \"chairlift\" rhymes with \"airlift\" and thus makes an easy substitution. The chair force is also a name that other service branches use to make fun of the air force. Note East Germany wasn't blockaded, only West Berlin. \"Blockade\" is misspelled.\n\nLocation: Germany\n\n===Israel===\n[[File:umwelt israel.png]]\n\nTranslation: Mom, I met a great guy! But he's not Jewish. ...Wait, what do you mean \"neither are we\"? I'm completely confused.\n\nA reference to the multiple use of the word Jewish to denote both a {{w|Judaism|religious group}} and a {{w|Jews|nationality/ethnicity}}, as well as the stereotype of Jews holding low opinions of interfaith marriage.\n\nA side note: Randall accidentally drew an apostrophe instead of the similar-looking Hebrew letter י everywhere that letter should appear.\n\nLocation: Israel\n\n===Carnot Cycle===\n[[File:umwelt japan.png]]\n\nA pun on \"cycle\"; a \"{{w|Carnot cycle}}\" is a thermodynamic cycle (e.g. refrigeration). Its efficiency depends on the temperature of the hot and cold 'reservoirs' in which it is operating.  The icon on the side of the motorcycle resembles a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Carnot_cycle_p-V_diagram.svg/1000px-Carnot_cycle_p-V_diagram.svg.png graph of the Carnot cycle.]\n\nLocation: Japan\n\n===UK===\n[[File:umwelt uk.jpg|850px]]\n\nHe worded this as though to imply that the UK is a state of the U.S., and an unimportant one at that, which pokes fun at the UK, creating a paradox (sort of).\n\nLocation: UK\n\n===Blizzard===\n[[File:umwelt disasters blizzard.png|850px]]\n\nThis comic is aimed at the debate over whether earthquakes or blizzards are harsher conditions to live under. In keeping with the theme of umwelt, the comic demonstrates that the two people perceive the world in two different ways due to their different experiences: The Californian perceives a mild earthquake and a severe blizzard, while the Northeasterner perceives a severe earthquake and a mild blizzard.\n\nFor each particular location in which this displayed, the state name was substituted in the third panel.\n\nLocations: Alabama, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Georgia, Halifax, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, the Northeast, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ottawa, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Texas, Toronto, Tennessee, New York, Wisconsin\n\n===Tornado===\n[[File:umwelt disasters tornado.png|850px]]\n\nThis comic is aimed at the debate over whether earthquakes or tornadoes are harsher conditions to live under. In keeping with the theme of umwelt, the comic demonstrates that the two people perceive the world in two different ways due to their different experiences: The Californian perceives a mild earthquake and a severe tornado, while the Midwesterner perceives a severe earthquake and a mild tornado. It's similar to [[#Blizzard|Blizzard]].\n\nFor each location this displayed in the state name was substituted in the third panel.\n\nLocations: Alabama, Dallas, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ottawa, Tennessee, Texas (and Virginia, but it used Ohio in the third panel)\n\nTornadoes are a [[:Category:Tornadoes|recurring subject]] on xkcd. The picture used in [[1754: Tornado Safety Tips]] very reminiscent of the one from this version of Umwelt. [[Category:Tornadoes]]\n\n===Hurricane===\n[[File:umwelt disasters hurricane.png]]\n\nThis comic is aimed at the debate over whether earthquakes or hurricanes are harsher conditions to live under. In keeping with the theme of umwelt, the comic demonstrates that the two people perceive the world in two different ways due to their different experiences: The Californian perceives a mild earthquake and a severe hurricane, while the Easterner perceives a severe earthquake and a mild hurricane. It's similar to [[#Blizzard|Blizzard]] and [[#Tornado|Tornado]].\n\nFor each location this displayed in the state name was substituted in the third panel.\n\nLocations: D.C, Florida, Georgia, Houston, Miami, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia\n\n===Lake Diver Killer===\n[[File:umwelt lake diver.png]]\n\nThis comic shows a news reporter standing in front of a lake. She is reporting on a serial killer who targets divers. As more divers are sent in to investigate and/or search for bodies, more divers go missing, the implication being that they were also murdered. The more likely reason is the lake itself is dangerous for diving, and the divers probably drowned from natural hazards (undercurrents, entanglement, running out of oxygen in tanks, etc.) instead of a malicious assailant. Also, this is a sort of loop, where each time a diver gets killed, the investigative team goes and investigates, causing more divers to get killed, causing more deaths, and so on.\n\nLocation: Bay Areas, Metro Detroit, Vermont showed an image specifically referencing Lake Champlain\n\n===Lincoln Memorial===\n[[File:umwelt lincoln memorial.png]]\n\n{{w|Abraham Lincoln}}, the 16th president of the United States of America, was not an entity composed wholly of nanobots that attempted to consume the entire nation to then be imprisoned within the {{w|Lincoln Memorial}}.{{Citation needed}} The inscription references the epitaph at the actual Lincoln Memorial, which reads \"In this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever\".\n\nLocations: Illinois & Washington, D.C.\n\n===Helicopter Hunting===\n[[File:umwelt helicoptor.png]]\n\nIn Alaska, governments and individuals have {{w|Wolf hunting#North America 2|shot wolves en masse from helicopters}} in an attempt to artificially inflate populations of game, such as moose and caribou, to make hunting them easier. This is opposed by many, as the game populations are not endangered (thus, this threatens ecological balance); wolves are a small threat to livestock in North America; most of the wolf body —including meat and bones— goes wasted as they are sought mainly for their pelts.\n\nKnowledge of this issue was popularized by press around vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's support for this culling method.\n\nLocation: Alaska\n\n===Newspaper===\n[[File:umwelt life scientists.png]]\n\n[[File:umwelt life rit.png]]\n\n[[File:umwelt life umass.png]]\n\nCreating new life has long been a well understood process, in a lab or otherwise.\n\nThis comic is likely a reference to the title text of [[983: Privacy]]\n\nLocation: Various\n\nSpecific versions appeared for RIT and UMass Amherst\n\n===Robot Paul Revere===\n[[File:umwelt paul revere.png]]\n\nCombination of the legend of {{w|Paul Revere#\"Midnight Ride\"|Paul Revere}} and a computer bit that differentiates between two situations by indicating a zero or a one.\n\nLocation: Boston\n\n===Counting Cards===\n<!-- card counting explanation needed. -->\nAll four colleges in this series are in Massachusetts and, being similar, in pairs, rival each other to some extent (Harvard-MIT and Smith-Wellesley). The comic contains a reference to the {{w|MIT Blackjack Team}}, which entered popular culture via the {{w|21 (2008 film)|film 21}}, and a possible reference to Orwell's book '1984' and/or {{w|Chain of Command (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|popular homage to it via Star Trek}}: \"There are four lights.\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChYIm6MW39k]\n\nBonus: The thought-gears in panel 3 are spinning against each other.\n\nLocation: Harvard\n\n[[File:umwelt counting cards harvard.png]]\n\nLocation: MIT\n\n[[File:umwelt counting cards mit.png]]\n\n\"Course 15s\" at MIT are the business major students, often mocked for taking a less-rigorous program. The different interpretation for why the MIT students could not count cards compared to Harvard may be a reference to the theme of umwelt.\n\nLocation: Smith\n\n[[File:umwelt counting cards smith.png]]\n\nLocation: Wellesley\n\n[[File:umwelt counting cards wellesley.png]]\n\nBoth Wellesley and Smith are all-women colleges in Massachusetts.\n\n===Giant Box Trap===\n[[File:umwelt box trap.png]]\n\nRandall got his undergrad in Physics at the {{w|Christopher Newport University}}, and was scheduled to return shortly to give a talk. The \"Trible\" figure on the right is Paul Trible, the then-president of CNU. This comic depicts a classic trap, where an upside-down box is propped up with a stick. When the stick is removed, by pulling a string, the box falls and traps whatever is underneath it. Aside from the joke of the obvious trap, there's also the fact that the president would not be responsible for revoking unearned diplomas.\n\nLocation: Christopher Newport University\n\n===Chemo Support===\n[[File:umwelt chemo.jpg]]\n\n[[Cueball]] has shaved his head in support of people going through {{w|chemotherapy}} but, as he is always depicted as a stick figure with no hair, no one can tell.\n\nRandall's now-wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, and apparently DFCI is where they've been spending much of their time.\n\nLocation: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n\n===Reviews===\n[[File:reviews.png]]\n\nThe previous strip appears twice when using [[wikipedia:Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].\n\nThis strip was previously used in [[1036: Reviews]].\n\nBrowser: Any using Tor, xkcd API (JSON, RSS, Atom), w3m and reports of seeing it on a Kindle Fire HD, unixkcd; also happens if visiting with a browser that does not support JavaScript (such as Firefox with NoScript)\n\n===Nothing===\n\n[[File:Umwelt blank.jpg]]\n\nIn some cases, the comic can be completely absent, with only the top and bottom buttons visible. On most newer browsers, this is caused by a script loading part of the comic via an HTTP request while the rest of the webpage is delivered over HTTPS. This is referred to as [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content mixed content] and is blocked on modern browsers by default due to security concerns.
