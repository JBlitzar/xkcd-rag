(It would be several more years before GPS-enabled smartphones displaced separate GPS devices on the market,<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html</ref> so the device presents exciting new opportunities to the couple.) She suggests that they take their current coordinates and modify the latitude and longitude with a simple function based on their birthdays, thereby pointing to an arbitrary, non-random location, to which they would go to and make out. For example, if Cueball was born on, let's say, April 1, 1986 and Megan on August 12, 1988 and they are somewhere in New York ([https://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=New%20York%20City&params=40.768062_N_-73.98468_E_type:landmark 40.768062,-73.98468]), the coordinate they type could make ([https://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?params=40.040186_N_-73.081288_E_type:landmark 40.040186, -73.081288]) (assuming US date format), or ([https://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?params=40.860401_N_-73.880812_E_type:landmark 40.860401, -73.880812]) (assuming following [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601]). The good thing about keeping the number before the decimal point is that the distance is still realistic to get to by car. Megan suggests to make out in this place. This procedure is somewhat of a precursor to [[Geohashing]].\n\nThe title text suggests that if the location you make for yourselves is over water (which the example above happens to be), you either need to find a boat or find some rule that you can change to preserve the promise of making out, and if you can't do either, then there is no way you'd get to make out.\n\nFrom ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'':\n{{quote|We tried this and ended up on the grounds of the only particle accelerator for a hundred miles.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Check it out - I got a GPS receiver for Christmas! What should we do with it?\n\n:Megan: Let's take our latitude & longitude, put our birthdays after the decimal points, then go to that spot and make out.\n\n:[Cueball is in love.]\n\n:Merry Christmas from XKCD{{sic}}\n:[Car driving off in to the distance.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Christmas]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
