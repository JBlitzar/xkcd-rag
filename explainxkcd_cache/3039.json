The graph tracks the ''single'' most altitudinous individual at any given time, measuring height above Earth's surface rather than sea level, meaning residents of {{w|Tibet}} or the {{w|Andes|high Peruvian Andes}} gain no particular advantage.\n\nPrior to the {{w|Montgolfier brothers#Piloted flight, autumn_1783|first confirmed ascent}} in a balloon in 1783, the high points were due to \"various falls\" and \"catapult accidents,\" such as being caught in a {{w|trebuchet}} when fired. Once {{w|balloon}} flights began, heights of up to 10km were attained, despite some {{w|List of ballooning accidents|dangers}}. The advent of {{w|airplanes}} in the 1900s led to even greater heights, particularly after World War 2 when regular high-altitude flight became common among bomber pilots.\n\nThe emergence of {{w|spaceflight}} in the late 1960s dramatically increased the upper spikes, with the {{w|Apollo Program}} (from {{w|Apollo 8}} to {{w|Apollo 17}}) reaching approximately 400,000km during Moon missions. After the Moon landings, altitudes settled to orbital distances, with the \"Space Station\" era marking continuous human presence at about 400km since November 2000, occasionally higher for missions like servicing the {{w|Hubble Space Telescope}} at 515km.\n\nNotable exclusions from the graph include early experiments with man-flying kites, cathedral workers, and visitors to structures like the Eiffel tower (276m), suggesting Randall excluded cases where people were standing on permanent structures. The graph also appears to ignore cases that are difficult to substantiate, such as those caused by violent winds, although it conveys an impression of omniscient certainty.\n\nThe title text speculates about pre-balloon altitude records (excluding cases like jumping gaps on mountain bridges), suggesting survival from falls into water or snow, or more extreme scenarios involving gunpowder explosions or {{tvtropes|LavaSurfing|volcanic eruptions}}. As of the comic's date, the record for surviving a cliff jump into water is 58.8 meters, set in 2015.\n\nA different interpretation could track the highest altitude visited by any ''still living'' human, similar to [[893: 65 Years]] but following different rules. This would maintain Moon-height records from the first {{w|Apollo 8}} orbit until the last Apollo astronaut's death (missions 8-17), unless superseded by {{w|Human mission to Mars|greater records}} or achievements from {{w|Chinese space program#Near future development|other space programs}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Do NOT delete this tag too soon.}}\n\n:Height above Earth's surface of the highest-altitude human over time\n:(very approximate)\n\n:[A line graph is shown, with frequent spikes on the line.
