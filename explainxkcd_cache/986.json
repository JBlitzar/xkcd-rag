But I'm afraid to try because I worry someone might call while I'm doing it and ask what I'm up to, and I won't be able to think of a lie.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nHere, we see [[Cueball]] using the restroom; as the title text indicates, he is eliminating the liquid waste from his body, or peeing. Some people feel a brief compulsion to urinate after drinking, even if they don't actually need to. Cueball says that he avoids the use of the drinking fountain right after peeing, because he is apparently one of these people and he is afraid that he will be forced into immediately peeing again. And as in the image above, he would be stuck in a loop.\n\nThe title text says Cueball/[[Randall]] would be embarrassed in trying to explain his experiment to someone, as an experiment of this nature seems interesting to geeks but gross to non geeks (and to geeks too, if we're being honest),{{citation needed}} and he wouldn't be able to lie about what he was doing if called by someone.\n\n[https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081204204655AApXIEA A thread on Yahoo Answers] (dead link) with a (purported) biology major concluded that drinking from a hose and peeing at the same time would not work: the kidneys can only process so much pee at a time, and the majority of it is re-used. But since the experiment doesn't put a lower boundary on the flow that would be regarded as an ongoing pee, this objection is invalid. Constantly sipping and dripping might be possible.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball leaving a public bathroom. A water fountain is next to the bathroom door.
