[[Cueball]], representing one of the three technicians we see working in a mission control center, suggests moving the rocket outside in order to avoid issues that arise from dealing with the window. This immediately gets pushback by the other technicians who, in stereotypical behavior of shut-ins, don't want to bother leaving their comfortable computers. [[Ponytail]] complains the outside 'is so sunny', which ironically would normally indicate good conditions that would permit a launch. [[Hairy]] also objects because it would cause them to have to deal with bugs, presumably not of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raMmRKGkGD4 technical type which might commonly prevent a launch], but more of the living, biting kind.\n\nThe title text continues the comicâ€™s theme of taking aerospace terms literally, with a play on the two meanings of ''scrub''. Normally, in the context of a rocket launch, this would mean to cancel the launch, but here it apparently means that some cleaning job is required, possibly of the window in question (though how that would help them to launch the rocket through it is unclear), or possibly to deal with the aftermath of launching through the closed window.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail and Hairy can be seen sitting either side of a technical-looking double-sided console, with Hairy, on the right side, wearing a mike-and-headphones headset.]\n:Ponytail: The launch window will only be open for another 90 minutes.\n:Ponytail: We may have to scrub.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel the view is expanded to show, that to the left of Ponytail, Cueball is sitting with his back to her, operating a similar but single-sided neighboring console.]\n:Cueball: You know,\n:Cueball: Given all our issues with the launch window,\n\n:[Same setting but in a frame. Cueball has turned around towards the other two.]\n:Cueball: Have we thought about moving the rocket outside?\n:Ponytail: Ugh, no. It's so sunny out.\n:Hairy: And there are bugs.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]\n <!-- bugs ->>"
