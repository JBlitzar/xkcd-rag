And by 'sell the marketplace' we mean 'play shooters, sometimes for upwards of 20 hours straight.'\n}}\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Crowdsourcing}} is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. In the new Internet economy, it is not uncommon for companies to rely on crowdsourced designs or ideas, to contract the marketing to another firm, or to interact with customers through social networks established by other companies. \n\n[[Cueball]], however, is describing a business strategy which manages to do all three by \"crowdsourcing\" the process of getting a company and a prospective employee together. Cueball describes it as helping people with ideas find funding, similar to Kickstarter or Indiegogo, but rather than setting up a system to facilitate the process, he plans to use already-existing social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter).  Effectively, by relying on outside support for all steps of the business plan, his company does nothing; however, because the parts of his strategy are all feasible separately, and because he describes them with a barrage of trendy buzzwords, his audience is impressed and fails to notice the company's essential pointlessness.\n\nIn the title text Cueball claims that \"we don't sell a product, we sell the marketplace,\" a phrase that typically describes a company whose business model is to facilitate the business of other companies, and would be a plausible reason for a company to not make products. However, this is revealed to be yet more empty buzzwords when Cueball clarifies that they don't actually do any work and instead play video games (\"shooters\" refer to shooter games, a genre of video game).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in front of a flowchart on a wall, indicating with a pointer.
