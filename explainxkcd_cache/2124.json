Megan recites the grown-up, professional, scientific justification for the mission, but soon her enthusiastic and nerdy attitude toward space breaks through, and she exclaims \"space\" and \"pew pew pew\" (An internet meme for the sound of lasers, inspired as a typical sound that media space weapons make, and now an onomatopoeia often used in gaming speak for ray weapons and spells as a joke) with childish abandon. Ponytail wants her to rein in her enthusiasm during the actual hearing as the funding is unlikely to come if they are behaving childishly instead of being professional.\n\nThe joke is that most of the motivation people working in space agencies have for spending billions of dollars and other resources on interplanetary exploration is not really for all the stuffy reasons listed, but simply because they believe space is cool. Funnily, due to the vacuum in space, you would actually not hear sounds and so some part of the enthusiasm is entirely childish.\n\nThe title text refers to a repurposable piece of electronics contained within specific {{w|greeting card}}s, which plays a prerecorded song when the card is opened. Usually, these cards play a song, like \"Happy Birthday\", when they are opened. Apparently, their grant application has incorporated speakers which play \"spaceship noises\", in order to stimulate excitement about the coolness of space in the receiver which is in contrast to the business-like atmosphere that a mission hearing would normally have. An additional joke is that the card will likely hurt their chances to get the funding instead of stimulating excitement in the receiver.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Ponytail are standing and talking.]\n:Ponytail: All ready for the hearing?
