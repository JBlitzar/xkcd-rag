Whereas the traditional approach was for such rocketry to allow most of the initial launch-vehicle to be a single-use stage that was effectively destroyed once it had fulfiled its purpose, it has become a developmental aim across much of the commercial side of the industry to introduce as much reusability as possible in the mission hardware to potentially save costs and construction time.\n\nIn order to accomplish a successful recovery, expended stages have been given unprecedented ability to control their fall back to the ground, often in a manner that allows them to propulsively halt their descent directly over a prepared landing pad (on land or sea) and settle down softly enough on landing gear to be refurbished and reused (sometimes for {{w|List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters#Booster 1061|more than twenty subsequent missions}}). For the recent Starship test, the one (and, as of this comic, only) attempt to recover its {{w|SpaceX Super Heavy#B9%E2%80%93B12|Super Heavy Booster}} involved being precisely guided to be ''caught'' by the {{w|SpaceX Starbase#Orbital Launch Pad A|original launch tower}}; though it is never expected to refly, as a test prototype, it survived the whole process. This is in contrast with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ plenty of examples], where the landings (or their aftermath) were not quite so successful. \n\nThough SpaceX is the current leader in such an accomplishments, there are other companies who are various degrees along a similar developmental route. [[Randall]] claims that he has  an organisation that is amongst them, and has achieved the non-trivial feat of being able to direct the discarded rocket stage ''very precisely'', yet without that extra bit of ability to ensure that it doesnâ€™t then subsequently explode. The team has therefore decided to exploit their achievement (to precisely control the rocket) to send it 'safely' into a hole that (barely larger than the rocket's cross-section, and with a sturdy lid directly manhandled by a [[Cueball]] employee) allows it to {{wiktionary|rapid unplanned disassembly|rapidly disassemble}} in a planned and 'safe' manner. Of course, as a [[:Category:Compromise|'compromise']], it does not achieve the original aims of recoverability and reusability, yet it also is intrinsically far more complicated than the default option of just letting the hardware generally fall to destruction somewhere in a handy 'empty' down-range area that {{w|Spacecraft cemetery|shouldn't inconvenience anybody}}.\n\nWith the comic depicting the 'disposed' stage as powering downwards, this might explain their lack of success in perfecting any form of intact recovery, as practical examples of this technology tend to spin the craft around to make use of the main thruster(s) for a {{w|retrorocket}}-assisted {{w|VTOL|landing}}, or at least don't try to counteract the passive deceleration provided by parachutes or other purposeful aerodynamic drag, in order to touch the ground at a survivable velocity.\n\nAn explosion in a sealed container is potentially much more dangerous than an explosion in the open, depending on the strength of the container. If the container is strong enough to hold the pressure from the explosion, that pressure could be released in a controlled fashion, safely. But if the container is too weak, it could suffer a catastrophic failure, sending shards of its walls and anything around it flying outwards at high speed. Even if the container is initially strong enough, it could be weakened by repeated explosions, and fail at a random time in the future. As the 'container' is mostly a hole dug into the ground, of indeterminate depth, it might be considered fairly robust in itself, especially if given a reinforced lining. However, this then risks forcing the majority of the resulting explosion up into the lid, which looks strong and heavy yet is closed at least partly by the effort of just one person. It also risks that worker being right next to the track of the descending rocket stage, where they would be at risk of experiencing all kinds of secondary damage, if not being directly in the explosion if they get the timing of the lid-closure wrong. An actual {{w|Operation_Plumbbob#Missing_steel_bore_cap|attempt to put a lid on an underground explosion}} succeeded only in blowing the lid off at such velocity that it was never found.\n\nThe title seems to refer to the sound effects of dragging an element into the trash on computers. Or, alternatively, the sound of a canister being sucked into a pneumatic tube. This is perhaps a reference to Tesla vehicles being quiet and having \"vroom\" noises pumped into the cabin to satisfy customers.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A two-stage rocket is ascending with a plume of exhaust behind it]\n:[The first stage falls off and the second stage ignites]\n:[The first stage begins to fall, turned off]\n:[The first stage reignites to control trajectory and attitude]\n:[The first stage falls toward a large, but barely wider hole with a lid.
