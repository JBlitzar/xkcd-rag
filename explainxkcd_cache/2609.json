She lives in Rivendell, you wouldn't know her.\n}}\n*The comic is a link to a YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt2qCjL6-n4 video].\n\n==Explanation==\nIn {{w|The Lord of the Rings}}, the {{w|Ent|Ents}} are a species of tree-like humanoids, such as the one depicted in this comic. The comic shows an Ent, presumably {{w|Treebeard}}, meeting with some of the nine from the {{w|Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(characters)|Fellowship of the Ring}}.\n\nPart of the backstory of the Ents is that all the females of their species (the Entwives that this comic is named for) had disappeared thousands of years before during {{w|Sauron}}'s war of the {{w|History_of_Arda#Second_Age|second age}}. The Ents and the Entwives lived in separate locations, and eventually, when the Ents went to visit the Entwives, the latter were seemingly nowhere to be found. The Ents have been searching for their lost mates ever since. The loneliness of the Ents' all-male society is considered a great tragedy in their culture. It is several thousand years ago in the time of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Ents have all but forgotten how the Entwives even looked. They live for many thousands of years.\n\nThis comic uses that backstory to satirically comment on the extreme gender imbalance of the protagonists of Lord of the Rings; when presented with the all-male Fellowship, the Ent assumes that they must come from a race afflicted by a similar tragedy. In a broader sense, this can be read as a commentary on how few female characters there are in the trilogy overall. In reality, the general lore presents, or at least mentions, the existence of at least multiple (if not numerous) female characters of almost all races that make up the fellowship (dwarf, man, elf, hobbit), and does not suggest that what happened with the Ents and their Entwives happened to any other race.\n\nThe clickable link on the image leads to the satirical video ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt2qCjL6-n4 Lord of the Rings Trilogy but it's EVERY scene where two female characters interact]''. The creator claims that this shows all the scenes from the trilogy where two female characters interact (but later admits in the Youtube comments that there are indeed a few more). There is only one 3 second long scene, which only emphasizes how few female characters there are in the trilogy. The inclusion of this clip may be a reference to the {{w|Bechdel test}}, a baseline indicator of the representation of women in a piece of media that requires two women to have a conversation about something other than a man. Whether this three-and-a-half-word exchange is sufficient to pass the test is debatable. Later versions of the test suggest that the two women should be named (i.e. not just two incidental characters that have very few lines), whereas this scene is between {{w|Ã‰owyn}} and an unnamed girl. There is debate as to if there are other scenes with women speaking with women, and if we are only talking about human women, or if other races females would also count. There are at least three important female characters, but they do not meet/speak much if at all. But they have several scenes where they talk, even a long monologue... But if they speak to someone it is male characters.\n\nThe title text most likely refers to the character of {{w|Arwen}}, an elf woman and, later, wife of Aragorn; while somewhat important to the story, she is nowhere near as significant as the males of the Fellowship, despite being used more prominently in the movies than in the books. Even if she were part of the Fellowship, a single important woman wouldn't counterbalance the heavily male-centric storytelling. \n\nThe way that the title text is phrased is a reference to the proverbial (and implicitly imaginary) \"{{tvtropes|GirlfriendInCanada|Girlfriend in Canada}},\" a trope in which a single American character claims to have a girlfriend that their friends wouldn't know \"because she lives in Canada\" (or some other sufficient separation such as \"goes to another school\"), when in reality the reason that nobody else has met her is because she doesn't exist (with an implication that the character is a {{w|closeted}} gay, an {{w|incel}}, or just lying to make himself look better). {{w|Canada}} is one of only two countries with which the United States has land borders, making it a potentially plausible place for some American's long-distance girlfriend to live, and presumably the Fellowship consider the Elf kingdom of {{w|Rivendell}} to be sufficiently distant to allow the Ent to accept the plausibility of the statement without any further delving into potentially awkward details.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe comic depicts three {{w|hobbits}} (within frame) meeting the Ents, which suggests the conversation takes place when the Fellowship returns to Isengard on the way home after Sauron is defeated. In the books, the conversation about the Entwives took place much earlier, when only {{w|Merry Brandybuck|Merry}} and {{w|Pippin Took|Pippin}} were present.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A large treelike person (an Ent, maybe Treebeard) is holding one of his arms out towards six characters that are all looking at him. A man (Aragorn) with beard stubble and long hair, a dwarf (Gimli) with a helmet and a very large beard, an elf (Legolas) with long blonde hair (holding a bow down), and three short persons, hobbits, two with dark hair, and the middle one with blonde hair.]\n:Ent: Alas, there are no Ent women. The Entwives all vanished in the second age, during Sauron's war.\n:Aragorn: I'm so sorry.\n:Ent: And what about you all? Same story, I assume?\n:Aragorn: Huh? No, what do you mean?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:LOTR]]"
