This seems to mirror the plot of the 2006 comedy film ''{{w|My Super Ex-Girlfriend}}'', in which the eponymous character throws multiple things at the protagonist (including a shark) before breaking up with him.\n\nBoomerangs return in a kind of sequel [[475: Further Boomerang Difficulties]], which might also have yet another sequel in [[939: Arrow]]. Finally, boomerangs also became a main theme in the interactive comic [[1350: Lorenz]]. The same format of multiple bad endings to the same starting set-up is used in [[1515: Basketball Earth]].\n\nFrom ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'':\n{{quote|As the forumites gleefully discovered, you can make all sorts of stories just by rearranging these panels.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball throws a boomerang, but it hits him in the head when it returns.]\n\n:[Cueball throws the boomerang again, but this time several boomerangs chase after him.]\n\n:[Cueball throws the boomerang once more, and this time a shark inexplicably appears.]\n\n:[Cueball throws the boomerang a final time, and Megan appears, hovering.]\n:Megan: I'm leaving you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Boomerangs]]\n[[Category:Sharks]]"
