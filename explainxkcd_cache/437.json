Lithium batteries just need to get cheaper.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is another comic in the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby series]]. Here, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] describes a \"hobby\" of confusing self-righteous hybrid car drivers by creating situational irony. There are many anecdotal instances of drivers of \"green\" vehicles both criticizing owners of less fuel-efficient vehicles (such as SUVs) and for taunting them about how much more they are paying for fuel. Randall is reversing this by taunting/criticizing the owner of a Prius hybrid vehicle as though their roles were reversed. The owner of the hybrid car is irritated and does not understand what is being said. \n\nAlternatively, in the second sentence, Randall could be talking about the fact that the other person has a hybrid vehicle instead of a full electric vehicle, although Randall's SUV wouldn't be any better in that case. Another possibility is that \"go green\" refers to using public transportation or walking (or biking, skateboarding, and so on) in which case there is an argument to be made that the Cueball with the SUV might be better due to taking mass transit more. Or, as the title text alludes to, electric skateboards.\n\nThe title text, rather than being a joke or additional punchline, seems to be a serious opinion about how much more efficient electric vehicles are compared to gas-powered vehicles; they would be a far superior form of transportation if only they weren't so expensive. But an electric skateboard can only move a fraction of mass comparing to an SUV.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby:\n:Renting an SUV and confusing the hell out of hybrid owners\n:[A Prius Driver is pumping gas into his car at a gas station.
