A job interviewer, [[Hairy]], tells [[Black Hat]] exactly that.\n\nBlack Hat offers a briefcase to his interviewer. From the vague phrasing \"this\" and the context, one would expect the briefcase to contain money to bribe the interviewer into hiring Black Hat. Instead, it contains a portal or gateway into an impossibly deep chasm.\n\nAfter falling through the chasm, the interviewer lands in the interviewee's seat, and Black Hat is now sitting in the interviewer's seat, effectively switching their roles.\n\nThe former interviewer tries to pull the same trick on Black Hat, creating a momentary illusion of an {{w|infinite loop}} through {{w|recursion}}, a common theme in xkcd comics.\n\nWhen Black Hat opens the briefcase, however, he reveals another common annoyance when job hunting, being told that the opening has already been filled. Black Hat's statement works on two levels, one meaning that \"the job opening has been filled\", and the second meaning \"the opening to the briefcase's chasm has been filled\". In the latter sense, opening may also be used as a synonym of vulnerability, in which case filled would mean patched.\n\nThe title text is said by Black Hat. It refers to the fact that, even though Black Hat now has the interviewer's job, he has no idea what his function is.\n\nThere's a possible second meaning to the phrase \"perhaps this could change your mind;\" it may be that Black Hat and Hairy have quite literally swapped minds, thus why Black Hat is suddenly sitting in the interviewer's seat and finishing the interview and Hairy is sitting in the interviewee's seat being interviewed. The chasm inside the briefcase may have been a hallucination Hairy experienced whilst his mind was being swapped with Black Hat's.\n\n[[:Category:Job interviews|Job interviews]] are a recurring topic on xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is interviewed by Hairy.]\n:Hairy: ...but thank you for applying.
