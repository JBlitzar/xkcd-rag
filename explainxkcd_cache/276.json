For example, the following sentences are the same length in a monospaced font, but since we are using a {{w|proportional font}}, those lengths are not exact (the third line is noticeably wider):\n<font face=\"Times New Roman, Times\">\n:<rob> last night was nice\n:<emily> the best i've had\n:<rob> yeah it was AMAZING\n</font>\n\nThe title is possibly a double reference, both to a monospaced font and to lines of the same length. Initially, by mere chance, Emily's and [[Rob]]'s lines were exactly the same length. This made Rob want to continue the pattern. That Rob feels forced to change what he wants to type to continue the pattern could be a symptom of {{w|obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder}}. Because of the monospaced font, any reply with nineteen characters (including space) would have continued the pattern. For example, \"definitely for real\" or \"i'm in love with you\" would have worked, but Rob didn't seem to think about them\n\nIn the title text Rob continues to write a sentence: \"I wish I knew how to quit this so I wouldn't have to quit you.\" He acknowledges that he has a problem, since he cannot quit his desire to keep the fixed width. If he could have quit this desire, then he would not have had to quit Emily. But since he felt he had to keep the fixed width, he involuntarily wrote something that felt for Emily as if he quit her. And he was too late out with his apology for her to read it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A man, Rob, is sitting at a computer. The text is an IRC-style transcript of a conversation, in a fixed-width font. He is text-messaging a girl he slept with named Emily; their messages read as follows:]\n<pre>\n<rob> hi\n<emily> hey you\n<rob> last night was nice\n<emily> the best i've had\n<rob> yeah it was AMAZING\n<emily> ok, i have to ask\n<emily> is this for real?\n<emily> or is it just sex\n<rob> definitely just sex\n<emily> holy shit\n<emily> are you serious?\n<emily> you don't know how much that made\n        my stomach hurt\n<emily> i want to cry\n<rob> i'm sorry\n<rob> i wanted to type 'i love you'\n<rob> but our line lengths were syncing up\n<emily> ...\n<rob> and it would have broken the pattern\n* emily has disconnected\n</pre>\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring [[Rob]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Rob]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
