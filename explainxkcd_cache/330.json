Even if both men are gay, the fact that they're friends (as the rule in the book describes them) suggests that they are not currently having sex on a regular basis.{{citation needed}} In this case - and even more so if the friends are heterosexual - most people would not take the book's suggestion, and it may even make them feel embarrassed and awkward.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe book that one of the [[Cueball]]s grabs appears to be some sort of all-encompassing rule book, its reach including the social sphere. Obviously this book is fictional, but the line \"I think there's a rule about this\" sounds like a reference to folk \"rules\" or guidelines like the \"{{w|five-second rule}}.\"\n\n{{w|Crisco}} is a brand of shortening, a fat that is solid at room temperature and frequently used in baking, though is also sometimes used, as implied in this instance, as a sexual lubricant. Crisco was referenced again in a sexual context in the title text of [[414: Mistranslations]] and later as a part of a weird dream also in the title text of [[557: Students]].\n\nThe title text could be spoken by either one of the characters or [[Randall]]. It attempts to preempt any awkwardness or judgment the reader may have about this situation by transferring responsibility to the rule book.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is lying on the floor with his friend.]\n:Cueball: So what do you want to do?\n:Friend: Still no ideas.\n:Cueball: Wait, I think there's a rule about this.\n:[Cueball goes to bookshelf and removes a book called \"Rules\".]\n:[The book of rules is opened to the following:\n:RULE social.b.99.1\n:If friends spend more than 60 minutes deciding what to do, they must default to sexual experimentation.\n:[Cueball is standing, holding the book. The friend is in the process of standing up.]\n:Cueball: Huh.\n:Friend: I did not know that rule.\n:Cueball: Me neither.\n:Friend: I'll go get the Crisco.\n\n==Trivia==\nA book suggesting a more or less unrelated solution that is accepted anyway is also pulled from a shelf in [[1024]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Homosexuality]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
