(It is distinct from a ''death notice,'' which is a paragraph, often short, usually paid, describing a person who has recently passed away. They usually offer a few words of praise and a list of surviving relatives, as well as a scheduled time for memorial services.) Apparently, the editor of this newspaper's obituary section has just died, and they have pre-written their own obituary. This is often done for famous people, to speed the process of writing and fact-checking, but it is unusual for a not-so-famous person like this editor. In their obituary, they somewhat vainly describe themselves as cool, attractive, and universally beloved. The following sentence reveals that the editor had set up a system, perhaps based on a {{w|Dead man's switch}}, to automatically post (\"auto-post\") their own obituary.\n\nObituaries often note that the deceased is survived by some close family, such as parents, a spouse, and children. This editor notes that they have been survived by 8 billion people, or the current population of the entire Earth, which is true because almost all of them are still alive and the editor isn't. However, the editor combines the two senses of what it means to survive another person, imagining that each of those 8 billion people would suffer the same heartbreak as close family generally do.\n\nThe title text references a common trope in culture, in which a person challenges Death, often personified as the {{w|Grim Reaper}}, to a game of skill such as {{tvtropes|ChessWithDeath|chess}}. The obituary editor claims that they have challenged Death to a series of games of skill and defeated Death in all of them. This victory has been so absolute that no person will ever die again, and therefore no more obituaries will ever be required. As a result, this editor's obituary will be the last one ever published, making it even more noteworthy.\n\nRandall has referenced this trope in [[393: Ultimate Game]], as a tribute to Gary Gygax, the inventor of ''Dungeons and Dragons''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Text on the top-left corner of a gray newspaper page.
