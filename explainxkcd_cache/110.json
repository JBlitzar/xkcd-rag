The phrase is spoken by Gable's character {{w|Rhett Butler}} as his last line, in answer to {{w|Scarlett O'Hara}} (Leigh) asking \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" The response indicates that Butler is no longer interested in O'Hara. This lack of interest, and the mention of the word \"damn,\" which was considered profanity at the time of releasing the film, led to the line being voted the #1 movie line of all time in 1995's American Film Institute ranking.\n\n[[Randall Munroe|Randall]] suggests that the line as written was not supposed to contain profanity, but the actor, Gable, inserted it, due to having {{w|Tourette's Syndrome}}, which is a neurological condition that is stereotypically characterized by bouts of random, uncontrollable cursing (and repetition of phrases or words).\n\nThe title text contains a more stereotypical Tourette's Syndrome outburst of several profanities in a row shouted mid-sentence.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Famous image of ''Gone with the Wind'' with Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) kissing Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh).]\n:The line was actually supposed to be \"Frankly, my dear, I couldn't care less.\" It's just that Clark Gable had Tourette's.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
