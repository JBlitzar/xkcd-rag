If you never acquire them, then not using them says nothing.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is a reference to a scene one might imagine in ''{{w|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace}}'' in which {{w|Yoda}} expresses doubt in a young {{w|Anakin Skywalker|Anakin}}'s potential to join the {{w|Jedi}} order. Yoda delivers a speech similar to the one that [[Ponytail]] gives here, except that the end of the sequence he presents is \"{{w|Dark side (Star Wars)|the dark side}}\" instead of \"being an asshole\". Yoda is ultimately correct; Anakin's fears lead him to join the dark side so that he may keep his loved ones from dying; this is at the expense of the stability of the galaxy, however, and his actions are in vain, as {{w|Padmé Amidala|his wife}} dies nonetheless. The circle on the ground is also taken from the ''Star Wars'' scene, and [[Cueball]] is presumably in the {{w|Mace Windu}} role.\n\nHere, [[Randall]] compares Anakin's decision to join the dark side to the propensity of many Internet commenters to correct others on their spelling and grammar, and to the extreme prevalence of criticism over commendation or confirmation. Randall's point is that correcting people, like joining the dark side, ultimately stems from insecurity.\n\nPonytail and Cueball challenge [[Megan]] to type the sentence \"I heard you're idea's and their definately good\", which contains four {{w|Commonly misspelled words|common misspellings}} (''{{w|wikt:you're|you'''&#39;re'''}}'' instead of ''{{w|wikt:your|you'''r'''}}'', ''{{w|possessive|idea'''&#39;'''s}}'' instead of ''{{w|wikt:ideas|ideas}}'' [see {{w|greengrocers' apostrophe}}], ''{{w|wikt:their|the'''ir'''}}'' instead of ''{{w|wikt:they're|the'''y're'''}}'', and ''{{w|wikt:definately|defin'''a'''tely}}'' instead of ''{{w|wikt:definitely|defin'''i'''tely}}''), which means ''probably'' as defined in [[2871: Definitely]], and a misapplied verb (\"heard\" instead of \"read\").\nRegarding the content, this sentence is one that is highly unlikely to be ever read in an internet argument, as almost every time people still have things they claim to know better about.\nMegan thus can't bring herself to type this sentence, having spent so much time judging others for their trivial errors, even when they're saying helpful things like the sentence in question. Instead, it is strongly implied that she smashes the computer and runs away — demonstrating the sort of anger that [[1735: Fashion Police and Grammar Police|\"Grammar Nazis\"]] and internet wiseacres like her can feel about punctuation and spelling errors, and about content-related errors respectively. Cueball and Ponytail remark on this, both failing to use {{w|apostrophe}}s.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Terry Pratchett}}'s novel ''{{w|Equal Rites}}'', in which the characters discover that the most powerful magic is not using magic — with the distinction that not using magic because you don't know how is not the same as choosing to refrain from using magic when you do know how. Randall is comparing this with use or misuse of the rules of Standard English: not even knowing the rules is not admirable, whereas knowing the rules but choosing to disregard them is. There is also a double meaning - not writing anything at all is in fact \"saying nothing\". <!--This could potentially have another meaning. Randall's included spelling errors could mean that since Megan is not technically following the rules of writing, she isn't actually writing it, therefore not meaning it.-->\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The two Internet Bodhisattvas Ponytail and Cueball lecture Megan encircled by a wheel placed upon the ground.]\n:Ponytail: To achieve '''internet enlightenment''', you must free yourself from insecurity.\n:Megan: But insecurity keeps me humble!\n\n:[Ponytail continues talking.]\n:Ponytail: No. Insecurity leads to conceit. Conceit leads to judgment. \n:Ponytail: Judgment leads to being an asshole.\n\n:[A laptop is placed on a stand in front of Megan.]\n:Megan: I'm ready. How do I begin?\n:Ponytail: Type this sentence.\n:[White text on black background.]\n:I heard you're idea's and their definately good.\n\n:[The laptop has been smashed to the floor. Megan is no longer in the circle.]\n:Ponytail: She wasnt ready.\n:Cueball: Its a difficult road.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]"
