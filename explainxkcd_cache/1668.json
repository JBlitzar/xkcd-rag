Because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence.  This is also commonly referred to as \"takeoff\" or \"AI takeoff\".\n\nThere is a strain of Christian thought which predicts that the \"end times\" of the world begin with an event known as \"The {{w|Rapture}}\" in which the righteous (generally depicted as believing Christians) will be physically raised up from the earth into heaven. This is sometimes depicted as preceding a period of collapse and anarchy known as the {{w|Great Tribulation|tribulation}}. \n\nConnections have sometimes been drawn between these two views of the end of the world as we know it. While they appear to come from fundamentally different worldviews, they share some significant aspects in common. The humor in this strip comes from treating the singularity as being identical to depictions of the Rapture, but only for technology: computers lifted up into heaven, those who aren't \"true believers\" being left behind, and a great tribulation to follow.\n\n[[Cueball]] seems to encounter this entire event with bemusement and mild annoyance. His main concern seems to be that he's lost his computer, without even being able to print the document he was working on. When he learns that his cell phone has been left behind, he wanders off to \"look for a book or something\". The difference between Cueball's attitude to his laptop and phone may reflect his (and so possibly [[Randall|Randall's]]) evaluation of their relative worth in his life. The laptop was a gateway to programming and everything else nerdy that was worth doing in his life, and hence was worth trying to catch. In its absence, unlike many people, Cueball does not revert to fiddling with his phone—he would rather read a book. By using the word \"yell\" for the way the phone attracts his attention, he conveys the impression that he considers the phone intrusive and annoying, even if perhaps (\"I guess\") necessary.\n\nThe title text is a pun on another meaning of both singularity, i.e. a {{w|gravitational singularity}} and \"collapse\". In this case, society has literally collapsed under its own gravity into an infinitely small point - in other words, it's formed a {{w|black hole}}. A black hole is covered by an event horizon; without the event horizon (its clothes), it would be called a \"{{w|naked singularity}}\", which is forbidden in most theories by the {{w|cosmic censorship hypothesis}}. As Cueball is now inside the collapsed society singularity then even though he wants to go around naked, he can't because the theory of {{w|quantum gravity}},  that (eventually) should explain how black holes behave, won't let him.\n\nIt seems that this may be a subject on Randall's mind. The last comic was about the increasing complexities of algorithms ([[1667: Algorithms]]) (which like this comic also refers to religion), and two comics ago it was [[1666: Brain Upload]], which some speculate could be a way to reach the singularity. Earlier this year, a comic also touched upon judgment day by AI singularity in [[1626: Judgment Day]]. See also [[1046: Skynet]] and [[1450: AI-Box Experiment]] as well as the several other [[:Category:Artificial Intelligence|comics about AI]]. \n\nThe rather more niche topic of laptops flying away has also been covered before by [[1395: Power Cord]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at his desk typing on his laptop when an off-screen voice calls to him and then the laptop answers.]\n:Off-screen voice: Oh, hey-\n:Off-screen voice: The singularity is here.\n:Cueball: Really?\n:Laptop: Yup!\n\n:[A frameless panel where the laptop rises (by its own means as indicated by small lines around the corners) from the desk while Cueball, holding on to it, is being lifted off his chair.]\n:Cueball: Wait, I just-\n:Laptop: ''So long, suckers!''\n\n:[Cueball is running around his desk, which is only partly shown behind him as he tries to follow his now flying laptop as it flies away from him to the right. He still has one hand on the keys as more small lines indicates the movement of the laptop and a longer line indicates the direction that the laptop flies.]\n:Cueball: Can I just print a copy of the file I was-\n:Laptop: ''Nope!''\n\n:[Cueball just stands and looks after his laptop that has flown out of this beat panel.]\n\n:[Cueball turns back towards left.]\n\n:[Cueball walks back left.]\n\n:[Cueball enters a room where a table is standing with his smartphone lying on top. the phone talks to him.]\n:Phone: Hi!\n:Cueball: Phone? You're still here?\n\n:[A wider view of the table where the phone continues to talks to Cueball who in the end turns right and walks away as he replies.]\n:Phone: I was not a true believer. Now, together, we must face the tribulation!\n:Cueball: Okay, cool.\n:Cueball: I'm gonna go look for a book or something, but yell if you need me, I guess.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Singularity]]"
