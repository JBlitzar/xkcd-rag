In the first panel, the viewer is led to believe that it is a comic lamenting on the loss of love, as it states, \"We made it so far together, but then I lost you in the trees.\" However, when we read the second panel (\"Finally\"), it becomes clear that the joke is that the loss of this \"love\" is what he had been hoping for all along. The supposed pain that came from such losing a long relationship came not from lamenting the loss of something he put so much effort into, but instead into the fact that it took so long to get there. The title text just furthers this idea.\n\nThe expression could at first be interpreted as metaphorical, but from the later panels and the background, it may be a literal loss in a forest.  \n\nThere is a similar twist in comics [[334: Wasteland]] and [[1042: Never]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in a forest.]\n:Cueball: We made it so far together but then I lost you in the trees.\n\n:[A closer view of Cueball.]\n:Cueball: Finally.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
