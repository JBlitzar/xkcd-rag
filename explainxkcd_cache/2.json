''{{w|The Little Prince}}'' (in French ''Le Petit Prince'') is a novella written by {{w|Antoine de Saint-Exupéry}} in 1943, about the titular Little Prince, who lives on a very small nearly-spherical asteroid and visits other inhabited asteroids and eventually the Earth. The book is filled with drawings of the asteroid, the prince, and the travels they make. It is noted how, on occasion, {{w|Adansonia|baobab trees}} can begin to grow on these asteroids, and should they not be immediately uprooted, the growth of their roots would tear the asteroid apart. This illustration appears to be just before the trees tear apart the asteroid, based on how far the roots have spread.''The Little Prince'' would later be [[:Category:The Little Prince|referenced]] in the ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article {{what if|26|Leap Seconds}}, in [[618: Asteroid]], and in [[1350: Lorenz]] at [https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/a1-2014/VgSdMz8OAHQ8w5Ee432f5Q.png the end] of the space trip branch.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Some little rectangles are drawn to the left of the scan.]\n:[Two trees are growing on opposite sides of a very small sphere. Their roots cover most of the planet's surface.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 04]]\n[[Category:First day on LiveJournal| 04]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Sketches]]\n[[Category:The Little Prince]]"
