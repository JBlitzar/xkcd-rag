After the scripted greeting, Cueball, who [[:Category:Cueball's computer problems|has the most bizarre tech issues]], tells Hairy that his thermostat – a single-purpose device used to control indoor heating and air conditioning – is showing an error screen from the {{w|Android operating system}}, and asking if he wants to partition the volume. To partition a volume generally refers to an action where a hard drive's physical storage space (sometimes considered a {{w|Volume (computing)|volume}}) is assigned/''re''assigned as one or more logical divisions ({{w|Disk partitioning|partitions}}) for logistic reasons. The act of partitioning is traditionally only done when setting up entirely new hardware, or reinstalling ''everything'' from scratch, something that very few non-technical users will ever have to worry about (and, if they do, might be accomplished by letting happen the default options given to them on the first use of a device). Android is a fairly common operating system for small smart devices including thermostats, but the error implies that it is trying to mount a file with {{w|.doc}} extension (likely a [[1459|Microsoft Word document]]) as the {{w|Boot_device|boot device}}. An added twist is the \"(1)\" in the filename, which is commonly appended when a user attempts to copy a file into a directory that already has a file with the same name. Furthermore, the extension {{w|.docx}} has been the default option from Microsoft Office 2007 onwards rather than the earlier .doc extension used in the comic, implying that the file is likely a rather old one.\n\nThe error message suggests a system problem at a low level of the device. Not only is the operating system missing, but the device is trying to locate the operating system inside a Microsoft Word document, something that has little to do with regulation of temperature and probably has no way of getting onto the device in the first place, let alone being considered as a bootable file.\n\nThis is so abnormal that Hairy is briefly struck silent and, upon recovering, he suggests Cueball {{tvtropes|SuicideBySea|walk into the sea}}, rather than try to solve the issue.\n\nThe title text elaborates that the situation is so absurd that it must be divine punishment, so Hairy does not want to try and help him for fear of invoking the wrath of whatever deity is issuing it.\n\nPart of the humor is in the problem being only a slight exaggeration of real software issues. The symptoms are unlikely, yet possible (a thermostat could be running Android and could generate a report as a .doc file; given some data corruption, the name of the .doc file could get into the boot script and a volume could appear unpartitioned). It would take an expert Android or Unix engineer to fix, particularly on an embedded device with no obvious way to connect remotely or attach a keyboard. In real life, it would probably be easier to just replace an embedded device whose software was this broken.\n\nThis is explored further in [[2083: Laptop Issues]] where throwing Cueball into the ocean is mentioned. Both comics could explain the original \"computer problem link to oceans\" comic [[349: Success]].\n[[1084: Server Problem]] shows a similarly absurd error message, hinting at some incomprehensibly broken system.  Other comics dealing with internet of things include [[463: Voting Machines]], [[1966: Smart Home Security]] and [[3109: Dehumidifier]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairy, with a headset on, is sitting in an office chair at a desk with his hands ready on the keyboard of his computer.]\n:Hairy: Tech support, how can I help you?\n\n:[Cueball is on his smartphone while looking at a small blinking panel on the wall in front of him.]\n:Cueball: The little LCD on my thermostat says <span style=\"font-size:90%\">''Error: Android system recovery: Unrecognized boot volume \"/MONTHLY ENERGY REPORT (1).DOC\"</span>\n\n:[In a frame-less beat panel Hairy just stares at his screen with his hands on his lap.]\n\n:[Back to Cueball, now with Hairy's reply coming from the smartphone in a box with a jagged arrow pointing to the smartphone.]\n:Cueball: It's asking if I want to partition the volume. What should I do?\n:Hairy (on the phone): Have you tried walking into the sea.\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Cueball's computer problems]]"
