Here, the subject is {{w|Mathematical logic|formal logic}}, but the word \"if\" is replaced with a formal logic term \"{{w|If and only if|iff}},\" which means \"if and only if\".\n\nThe term \"If and only if\" sets two separate requirements, both of which must be met. In this case, you must love formal logic in order to be allowed to honk, and you must honk if you love formal logic. (Conversely, someone who does not love formal logic is prohibited from honking, and someone who loves formal logic cannot refuse to honk.) The title text further elaborates on this, saying in essence: \"Don't honk at me just because you're impatient that I stopped for a pedestrian.\"\n\nThe joke is the contained self-reference: you have to love formal logic to take the sticker seriously and honk for exclusively that reason. The title text reveals the sticker is actually there to stop people from honking at him altogether, because Randall understandably hates it when he yields for pedestrians only to get honked at by some impatient driver behind him; the ONLY reason you're allowed to honk is to declare your love for formal logic.  So by extension, if someone DOES honk while he is stopped for a pedestrian, he can simply enjoy the idea that the other driver loves formal logic rather than being impatient, transforming what might otherwise be an irritant into pleasure.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The rear end of a car (with an unreadable license plate), with a bumper sticker above the tailpipe to the right:]\n:Honk iff you love \n:<big>formal logic</big>\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic used to be [https://web.archive.org/web/20211215032158/https://store.xkcd.com/products/formal-logic-bumper-sticker available as a sticker] in the xkcd store before it was [[Store|shut down]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Comics with xkcd store products]]"
