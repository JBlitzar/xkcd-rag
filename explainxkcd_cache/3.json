The previous one was [[4: Landscape (sketch)]], and the next one was [[2: Petit Trees (sketch)]]. It was among the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen comics]] posted to LiveJournal within 12 minutes on September 30, 2005, on the first day of the xkcd LiveJournal account.\n\n==Explanation==\nLike many of [[Randall]]'s earlier comics, this does not appear to present a particular point, it's just a picture. The title text may be a reference to the classical {{w|\"Hello, World!\" program|\"Hello, world!\"}} program, traditionally the first program a developer runs when learning a new programming language.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A mountainous green island surrounded by a large amount of water. The mountain is the only feature recognizable on it.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the only comic that has the same number both on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] and on LiveJournal.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 03]]\n[[Category:First day on LiveJournal| 03]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Sketches]]"
