Meanwhile, in a huge upset, 11-year-old Martha Stewart knocked out the adult Ronda Rousey.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] shows [[Megan]] an {{w|mobile app|app}}, [http://magnuscarlsen.com/playmagnus Play Magnus] ([https://itunes.apple.com/app/play-magnus/id808138395?mt=8 iOS], [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.mw.playmagnus Android]) which claims to simulate playing {{w|chess}} against {{w|Magnus Carlsen}} at various ages. Carlsen is a {{w|chess grandmaster}} who is the world champion as of the date this comic was released. The idea behind the app is that as Carlsen grows up he becomes better at chess and thus it become exceedingly difficult to beat him as he gets older. As Cueball claims he could have beaten Magnus when he was 8½-year-old, but not a half-year later, we can now estimate Cueballs strength to be that of a typical adult hobbyist, with a FIDE rating of [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/2qcv95/what_is_the_strength_of_the_play_magnus_app_at/ about 1200].\n\nTaking the idea a step further, Megan wants such an app for other sports {{w|tennis}} and {{w|Swimming (sport)|swimming}}, where skill couldn't imaginably be simulated via an app at all. She wants to compare herself to an 8-year-old {{W|Serena Williams}}, a top-ranked professional tennis player. Or to a 6-year-old version of swimmer {{W|Michael Phelps}}, the {{w|List_of_multiple_Olympic_medalists#List_of_most_Olympic_medals_over_career|most decorated Olympian competitor}} of all time.\n\nCueball expands beyond sport, wishing to determine if he could cook better than an 11-year-old {{W|Martha Stewart}} (author of several cookbooks). Megan wonders if she'd have won an election against a 12-year-old JFK ([[John F. Kennedy]], the 35th American President). Obviously, cooking and politics were skills acquired later in life for both figures.  Also, the U.S. Constitution prohibits anyone from serving as President {{w|Age of candidacy laws in the United States|before the age of 35}}, so it seems unlikely that any 12-year-old candidate could win.\n\nCueball and Megan continue speculating about an app simulating the skills of random celebrities at various ages, even beyond the talents that made them famous. They finally end up comparing 8-year-old Magnus's swimming skill against 9-year-old Martha's (he wins). But they'd both lose a {{w|hot dog}}-{{w|Competitive eating|eating contest}} against the championship racehorse {{W|Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat}} at the age of two, which is not surprising since a horse is an adult at two years old, and is much larger and eats much more than a human. At this point even Megan realizes (with considerable understatement) their project \"has gotten weird\". Chess was previously compared to {{w|basketball}} in [[1392: Dominant Players]], which also mentioned Magnus. This is the tenth [[:Category:Chess|comic about chess]] on {{xkcd}}.\n\nThe title text extends the point to even greater absurdity, mixing and matching sports and people together, e.g. the ludicrous prospect of a young Martha Stewart knocking an adult {{W|Ronda Rousey}} (professional wrestler, former UFC champion, and actress) unconscious, or 9-year-old {{W|Muhammad Ali}} (professional boxer and activist) beating a 10-year-old JFK in {{w|air hockey}}. The horse also gets re-mentioned in the title text, losing in a hot dog eating contest against 12-year-old {{w|Ken Jennings}} (record-holder of winning streak on {{w|television game show}} ''{{W|Jeopardy!}}'').\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball walks from the right towards Megan while holding up his smartphone.]\n:Cueball: Magnus Carlsen has an app where you can play chess against a simulated version of him at different ages.\n:Cueball: I can beat the 8½-year-old, but lose to him at 9.\n\n:[While Megan talks to Cueball he lifts his hand to his chin, while holding the smartphone down.]\n:Megan: I want that, but for other games. Can I beat 8-year-old Serena Williams at Tennis? Swim laps faster than a 6-year-old Michael Phelps?\n:Cueball: We should make a simulator.\n\n:[Cueball walks out left and Megan follows him. He must have pocketed his phone as it is not in his hand.]\n:Cueball: ...Why limit it to games? Can I cook a better chicken than 11-year-old Martha Stewart?\n:Megan: Win an election against 12-year-old JFK?\n\n:[At the top frame of this panel there is a small frame with a caption. Below lies Megan on the floor to the left in front of her laptop, while Cueball sits on the floor to the right facing her in front of his own laptop. Between them are some heavy books.]\n:Soon...\n:[Cueball and Megan sitting at laptops in the bottom of the panel.]\n:Megan: Looks like 8-year-old Magnus Carlsen can swim faster than 9-year-old Martha Stewart.\n:Cueball: But they both lose a hot-dog-eating contest to 2-year-old Secretariat.\n:Megan: This project has gotten weird.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring John F.
