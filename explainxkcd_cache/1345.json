[[Megan]] responds by noting that everyone spends approximately eight hours per day in an unconscious state of {{w|sleep}}, but no one has yet pinned down the biological purpose of sleep. Despite this obvious mystery, most people aren't \"losing sleep over it.\" This implies that Cueball's observed curiosity has a perceptible and proximate limit.\n\nThis is not to suggest that scientists ''aren't'' researching sleep; scientists frequently conduct {{w|Sleep study|sleep studies}} — we just haven't found any satisfactory answers yet. Some popular hypotheses are to allow the brain a period to consolidate memories and to give the body a chance to repair itself.\n\nThe title text quotes {{w|William Dement}}: people sleep \"because we get sleepy.\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160618161328/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/05/sleep/max-text Secrets of sleep]). This of course is dodging the underlying issue. That this non-explanation is the best answer that a leading sleep researcher can provide, shows how little anyone knows about the subject. This may be an oblique reference to the [[:wikt:dormitive principle|dormitive principle]] of the French playwright Molière, who created a satirical character who claimed to have discovered the answer to a popular question: The reason opium makes someone sleepy, said the character, a doctor, was that it contained a \"dormitive principle\" (i.e., something that makes someone sleepy).\n\nIn [[203: Hallucinations]], Randall expressed similar surprise at the lack of interest in the nature of sleep.\n\nThe phrase \"and nobody knows why\" is commonly appended to urban legends, as in [http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/duckecho.asp A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why]. The implication is that something mysterious is going on and scientists are puzzled. [[1186: Bumblebees]] is another \"nobody knows why\" example.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: Humans are defined by our curiosity, our hunger for answers.\n:Megan: We all spend a third of our lives lying down with our eyes closed and '''''NOBODY KNOWS WHY.'''''\n:Cueball: Touché.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
