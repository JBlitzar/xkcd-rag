To do so, its underside is equipped with brushes and vacuums to clean the floors. Roombas are generally not meant to clean anything other than floors, but Cueball has his Roombas clean each other when they get dirty (as opposed to the simpler solution of cleaning the Roombas by hand).\n\nWhen Cueball demonstrates his Roombas cleaning each other to White Hat, White Hat remarks that the cleaning Roombas look sexually suggestive. The term \"{{w|Not safe for work}}\" (NSFW) describes material, like pornography, which may not be appropriate for a general audience, and in particular the kind of workplace internet browsing that would normally be particularly discouraged because it's likely to offend colleagues and/or violate workplace policies regarding such offense.  While the Roombas don't look at all like sexual organisms, their interaction evidently reminds people of sex, as they are going back and forth across each other's surfaces and change positions in the middle of it. When one Roomba is cleaning the top of the other, it looks like {{w|doggy style}}; when it's cleaning the bottom, it looks like {{w|missionary position}} or {{w|69 (sex position)|69}}, depending on the orientation of the front and back.\n\nCueball says that the {{w|YouTube}} video that he posted about this trick was demonetized, meaning that the video is not allowed to generate ad revenue. This normally happens to NSFW videos, such as those with NSFW content or a large amount of profanity.\n\nOne popular monetized pornography (porn) site is called {{w|OnlyFans}}. The title text says that Cueball tried to upload his video to a porn site dedicated to \"household appliances,\" but was unable to because its content was limited to {{w|Fan (machine)|fans}}. This is a play on words; for the real OnlyFans site, \"fans\" is short for \"fanatics,\" rather than mechanical fans.  A site dedicated to household appliance porn would be an example of [[Rule 34]] (if you can imagine it, there is porn of it). The same play on words has already been made in [[1378: Turbine]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball holds a finger up in front of White Hat. Behind Cueball, to the right, there is a stationary Roomba on the floor.]\n:Cueball: The Roomba keeps my floor clean.\n:Cueball: But what do I do when the '''''Roomba''''' gets dirty?\n\n:[In a frame-less panel White Hat looks over Cueball's shoulder as he has turned and gestures  towards two Roombas on the floor. The new Roomba is climbing up a ramp on to the first, still stationary, Roomba. Small lines behind the climbing Roomba indicates movement.]\n:Cueball: Simple:\n:Cueball: I got a second Roomba and a ramp, so they can clean each other.\n\n:[White Hat looks on as Cueball kneels down to flip the first Roomba over. He turns it on so it begins to move even though it is turned over, this is indicated with motion lines. The ramp is next to it, and the other Roomba is next to the ramp, now that one is stationary.]\n:Cueball: After the tops are clean, I flip one of them over so they can clean each others’ undersides.\n\n:[Cueball and White Hat are now watching the Roombas clean each other. The second Roomba has used the ramp behind them to climb on top of the first. Both of them are wiggling as indicated with several motion lines around them.]\n:White Hat: There’s nothing NSFW about this, and yet it’s the most NSFW thing I’ve every seen.\n:Cueball: Yeah, my YouTube DIY video about this got demonetized.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Roomba]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
