Once common in computer programming, its popularity diminished in the 1960s and 1970s as focus on {{w|structured programming}} became the norm. {{w|Edsger W. Dijkstra}}'s article [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362929.362947 \"Go To Statement Considered Harmful\"] in particular contributed to the decline of ''goto.''\n\nOften, people learning programming are told that ''goto'' is bad and should be avoided, but frequently, they are not given a good reason. [[Cueball]], as one of these people, sees no harm in using ''goto'' to avoid rewriting much of his program, most likely written in the C programming language. As a result, he is attacked by a [[velociraptor]]. Velociraptor attacks are a running joke (and fear) often expressed in [[xkcd]]. \n\nThe name ''main_sub3'' of the ''goto'' destination also shows bad programming style: it is an unmeaningful name suggesting that at least two similarly unmeaningful names are used for other ''goto'' marks and it is contradictory in that a chunk of code can either belong to the main program or to a subroutine, but not both.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Neal Stephenson}}, an author of cyberpunk novels. A label is used in many programming languages to refer to a point in a program that a goto instruction (or other flow-control statements) can jump to. The joke is that one of Stephenson's characters in ''{{w|Cryptonomicon}}'' is named Goto Dengo. When said out loud, \"Dengo\" sounds like \"Then go.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Sideways view of Cueball sitting at computer, thinking.]\n:Cueball: I could restructure the program's flow \n:Cueball: or use one little 'GOTO' instead.\n\n:[Cueball starts typing.]\n:Cueball: Eh, screw good practice. How bad can it be?\n:Text on computer: <tt>goto main_sub3;</tt>\n:<nowiki>*Compile*</nowiki>\n\n:[We now have a view from behind Cueball. Cueball looks at the computer.]\n\n:[A raptor jumps into the panel, pushing Cueball off his chair.]\n\n==Trivia==\n* Like all velociraptors in xkcd, the velociraptor in this comic is specifically the man-sized movie monster from ''{{w|Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park}}.''  Real velociraptors were more like [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vraptor-scale.png carnivorous turkeys.]  The beast devouring Cueball might actually be ''[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dromie_scale.png Deinonychus antirrhopus.]'' The beast may also be ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utahraptor Utahraptor.]''\n* This comic heads the official [http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.goto.php PHP manual page on goto].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Velociraptors]]\n[[Category:Programming]]"
