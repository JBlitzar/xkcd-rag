'Sorry, that accusation expires after one use per conversation.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn public debates, some {{w|Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist}} {{w|Christian}}s and some {{w|atheist}}s, while having different opinions, can behave surprisingly similar. Both can be very {{w|dogmatic}} about their beliefs, and be very disrespectful and accusative towards people of the other standpoint. [[Cueball]] is blaming both parties for being annoying. [[Megan]] sarcastically remarks that Cueball then must feel superior to just about everyone.\n\nThe title text takes this one step further when Cueball realizes that Megan's reply is just as smugly superior as his. For practical reasons (that is, the prevention of an endless, useless thought loop about your own thought process), Megan stops the tactic, by humorously stating that the statement expires after one use in a conversation. Of course, statements cannot expire.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan talking. Cueball has his palm out.]\n:Cueball: Personally, I find atheists just as annoying as fundamentalist Christians.\n:Megan: Well, the important thing is that you've found a way to feel superior to both.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Religion]]"
