In the first panel, there is a reference to the {{w|Loverboy}} song \"{{w|Working for the Weekend}}\"; both the song and the panel highlight how many working- and middle-class individuals often focus on enduring the workweek in anticipation of the weekend, when they can finally relax.\n\n[[Cueball]] then presents a philosophical observation: that the calendar is a human-made construct and that days of the week hold no meaning in nature. He suggests that, by collective agreement, one could simply declare Monday to be Saturday—and, taking this logic further, he proposes renaming all days to \"Saturday,\" effectively creating an eternal weekend.\n\nUpon closer scrutiny, however, the logic of this argument falls apart. Simply renaming the days of the {{w|Gregorian calendar}} would not change their social or economic function. The concept of \"the first Saturday of the week\" would quickly inherit the same negative connotations as \"Monday\". Moreover, if the suggestion implies the complete abolition of the traditional workweek, such a disruption would have dire consequences for the global economy—potentially triggering a collapse within days, hours, or even minutes, depending on the spread of the idea and resulting market reactions. This sense of impending doom is visually reinforced in the final panel, which is drawn in negative, with a black background, lending an ominous tone to Cueball’s concluding remarks.\n\nThere is no confirmed reference in the comic to either former U.S. President {{w|James A. Garfield}} or the comic strip character {{w|Garfield}}, although both are mentioned in the title text as the \"speechwriters\" behind the monologue. While James Garfield is not known for any notable speeches on time or calendars, the character Garfield frequently expresses disdain for Mondays — ironically, as a cat, he is not subject to a typical human work schedule.{{Citation needed}} The title text humorously suggests that the speech might have been penned by Garfield the cat, and proposes that it is superior to any speech ever written by President Garfield.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands behind a lectern on a podium before a very large crowd.]\n:Cueball: We all hate Mondays. We're all working for the weekend. \n:Cueball: But our chains exist only in our minds.\n\n:[Zoom in on Cueball from the lectern upwards, seen from an angle. He raises one hand in explanation.
