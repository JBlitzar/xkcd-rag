Objectivism is a moral system which promotes the institution of complete, unregulated Laissez-Faire capitalism (capitalism with no regulation or governmental intervention of any kind). A core claim of Objectivism is that it is a perfectly fair way of distributing resources. Depending on how one defines fairness, Objectivism is not fair -- since those who have been externally elevated to an advantageous position (e.g. via nepotism) will be able to acquire more resources with the same level of effort as another person who does not benefit from similar advantages. In the comic, this juxtaposition between the claim that Objectivism is fair, and the unfairness seen in its practical implementation, is satirized in the form of an Ayn Random number generator (a pun on Rand's name) whose creator claims is perfectly fair but demonstrably is not.\n\nA major ethical quandary Objectivists face is what is to be done about this unfairness; if Objectivism really is the perfect system for resource distribution, then why are resources distributed unequally under Objectivism? How one answers that question depends on a certain assumption -- that being, whether all humans are essentially equal in value (the accepted moral position in the West, c. 2024) or not. Some Objectivists disagree with the assertion of total human equality, concluding that if, under a hyper-aggressive survival-of-the-fittest system, people do not acquire equal levels of resources, then peoples' intrinsic values must be different. In the comic, this particular position is satirized with White Hat's cry of \"Well, maybe those numbers are just intrinsically better!\"\n\nA more nuanced description is that Objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximize personal happiness. In their view, if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people, they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others, no matter the cost to those others.\n\nAs an aside, \"biased\" random number generators exist. They're called weighted random number generators, and they have many practical applications when the programmer isn't lying about the number generator's function and output.\n\nThe title text identifies a group of people whose names match the {{w|regular expression}} <code>[https://www.debuggex.com/r/WsWV5ZSh8NTQL_JZ <nowiki>/(\\b[plurandy]+\\b ?){2}/i</nowiki>]</code>. A step-by-step explanation of the expression:\n*\\b is a word boundary, matching anywhere there is a 'word character' next to a non-word character—punctuation, digit, spacing, etc.\n*[plurandy] is a character class, and will match any single character from the set inside the square brackets; [adlnpruy] means exactly the same\n*the plus sign means ''one or more'' of the previous thing, so [plurandy]+ matches one or many of the characters in that class, one after the other\n*\" ?\" - a space followed by a question mark:  \"?\" means \"0 or 1 of the previous thing\", so a space is optional\n*the whole section in parentheses (\\b[plurandy]+\\b ?) translates to \"a word containing one or more letters, all of which are in the set [plurandy], followed by an optional space\"\n*the {2} on the end means to repeat the pattern, so it must match exactly twice\n*The slashes at each end mark out the pattern, and the \"i\" at the end is an expression qualifier means it is \"case insensitive\" (uppercase and lowercase match interchangeably)\n\nOverall, it matches two words separated by a space, composed entirely of the letters in [plurandy], which is what all the names listed have in common. This could suggest that those letters are, to quote White Hat, intrinsically better.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Person !! Brief Description\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap | {{w|Ayn Rand}} || Author, best known for her novels ''{{w|The Fountainhead}}'' and ''{{w|Atlas Shrugged}}''. \n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap | {{w|Paul Ryan}} || {{w|US Republican Party}} politician known to have been influenced by the writings of Ayn Rand.\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap | {{w|Rand Paul}} || US Republican Party politician, and son of fellow Republican (and self-styled libertarian) {{w|Ron Paul}}. Ron Paul is frequently referenced in early xkcd comics, and is known to be strongly influenced by Ayn Rand's writings. Rand Paul also counts Ayn Rand as an influence. Though it is sometimes believed that Rand Paul was named after Ayn Rand, this is not the case.\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap | {{w|Ann Druyan}} || Author, widow of {{w|Carl Sagan}}\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap | {{w|Paul Rudd}} || Actor, screenwriter, comedian\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap | {{w|Alan Alda}} || Actor, best known for the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV series ''{{w|M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H}}''.

On the other hand, given computers cannot store data of unlimited length, it is impossible for '''any''' real world computer random number generator to produce an irrational number in any of the usual integer or floating point representations—so probably not.  (Although a computer could encode irrationals or generate them randomly if it uses another representation, one of the standard algebraic number representations, for instance.)  Alternately, an Objectivist might argue that if the intent of the comic is to attack or mock Objectivism, then the comic inadvertently satirizes itself via the \"rationality\" interpretation.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sitting at a laptop, White Hat behind him.]\n:Cueball: This Ayn Random number generator you wrote '''''claims''''' to be fair, but the output is biased toward certain numbers.\n:White Hat: '''''WELL, MAYBE THOSE NUMBERS ARE JUST INTRINSICALLY BETTER!'''''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Programming]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Regex]]"
