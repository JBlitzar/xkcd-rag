Despite trillions of neutrinos passing through your body every second, one will hit you only once every 10 years or so.\n\nIn this comic, Randall gives a helpful tip to networking companies: in order to avoid latency issues with their servers, simply relocate their networking node to the Earth's core and use neutrinos to communicate with the surface, rather than radio waves, electrical impulses, photons in fiber-optic cables, etc. Since the core of the Earth is approximately equidistant from every point on Earth's surface, and nearly all neutrinos pass through solid matter unaffected, this allows communication with any server or network node anywhere on Earth, all with the same near-light-speed {{w|Latency (engineering)#Packet-switched networks|latency}} and without having to install wires, fiber optic cables, or anything else along the way. However, the cost is an unbelievable amount of lost data, since only a teeny teeny teeny teeny tiny (teeny<sup>4</sup> tiny) fraction of the neutrinos sent from the modem will actually be received by the servers on the surface, and the same again for those neutrinos that make the return journey: the specified packet loss amounts to 1 in 100 trillion packets completing the journey, with the rest missed (for reference: the lower threshold for acceptable packet reception is 98 in 100). If symmetrically failing to be detected, this suggests that only one in 10 million neutrino 'packets' is being received by the remote server, and only one in 10 million of the prompted replies are being received at Cueball's end.\n\nThis may still be a vastly better rate than expected. {{w|Neutrino detector|Neutrino detection}} with vastly bigger detectors than Cueball's device may only detect a fraction of the necessary neutrinos. Perhaps a little over 60 billion neutrinos per cm² per second pass through the Earth from the Sun, but detectors much larger than the whole of Cueball's indicated living space tend to detect no more than a few hundred of those per day. As the neutrino modems, at either end, must also ''generate'' (and, ideally, aim) their own modulated neutrino traffic, what proportion of the modem is usefully detecting is debatable. Beyond this issue, network packets consist of a ''series'' of signals to convey purpose, routing information and other overheads (including {{w|error detection and correction}}, which may be particularly important in this case). Even if direct point-to-point transmission (assumed, at least in this respect, to be reliably targeted) removes the need for full routing overheads, each {{w|ping (networking utility)|ICMP echo request}} ''and reply'' will still require a significant number of neutrino events to be triggered, and then sufficiently detected for what they are, to be of any practical use.\n\nA time delay of 45 ms is the approximate round-trip time for light (or neutrinos, which move nearly as fast) to travel the distance from the center of the Earth to the surface and back. Visible light, of course, couldn't make this journey through the rock at all. Perhaps only ''very'' long wavelength electromagnetic radiation could reliably penetrate half the Earth, which would give (like these hit-and-mostly-miss neutrinos, but still vastly better) a very low effective {{w|bit rate}}. This has the opposite issue of using a {{w|Sneakernet}} connection, where a reliable but physically slow transfer protocol (as discussed in {{what if|31|What-If: FedEx Bandwidth}}) can potentially reliably deliver huge amounts of data in a single successful communication.\n\nThere are also, of course, the practical problems of constructing a facility at Earth's core, which is extremely far away (~6400 km / 4000 mi underground), extremely hot (~6000°C / 6273K / 11292°Ra / [[1923: Felsius|8400°⋲]] / [[3001: Temperature Scales|−5900°''real'' C]]) and under extremely high pressures (~3½ million atmospheres / 50 million PSI).\n\nPonytail and Cueball are shown floating because a hollow space in the center of a body experiences near-zero gravity. This is because all the mass of the object is evenly distributed in all directions. While there is 4,000 miles of rock \"above\" you pulling you \"up,\" there is also 4,000 miles \"below\" you pulling you \"down\", with much the same amount left, right, front, back and every other direction, so you experience net-zero gravitational acceleration.\n\nThe title text refers to neutrino oscillation, which is a phenomenon in which neutrinos change between three different \"flavors\" - electron, muon, and tau neutrinos. A Nobel Prize was in fact awarded for the [https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3543 discovery of neutrino oscillation], which implied that neutrinos have mass, albeit an extremely tiny amount (< 2.14×10<sup>−37</sup> kg for the sum of the three flavors). The \"neutrino oscillation error correction\" could refer either to a way to correct for errors in the signal introduced due to neutrinos oscillating, as above, or for the method of error correction that cleverly ''uses'' modulated neutrino oscillation to its own advantage. Either of these could perhaps be considered such extraordinary developments as to make the {{w|system administrator}} involved deservedly elegible of a {{w|Nobel Prize}}, or perhaps {{w|List of prizes known as the Nobel or the highest honors of a field|one or other close equivalents}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Ponytail are inside a large white circle on a black background. Cueball is at a workstation typing on a computer keyboard, floating above a wheeled desk chair behind him. Ponytail is floating in the air up and to the right of him. Attached to Cueball's computer by cables are a second monitor or a tower unit floating to the left, and a large device labeled \"''Neutrino'' Modem®\" below and to its left.  A logo on the modem shows circle with five horizontal lines entering from the left; the fourth line from the top stops within the circle, while the others pass through to the right; this presumably represents neutrinos passing through a planet or other object.]\n:Cueball: Check it out—45ms ping times to every server on Earth!\n:Ponytail: That 99.999999999999% packet loss is pretty bad, though.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Networking tip: You can minimize worst-case latency by locating your node at the center of the Earth and communicating with the surface using neutrinos.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Tips]]\n[[Category:Sysadmins]]\n[[Category:Nobel Prize]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
