There may be a ''most efficient'' method, though sometimes the differences in efficiency between methods is only slight. People often try to save unnecessary work by first determining which is the \"best\" method - either the easiest or the most efficient. This can be a good approach, particularly where the savings prove to be significant. But it can also prove to be more time-consuming than just doing the task using one of the most obvious methods. The comic humorously exaggerates this.\n\nOne method of trying to determine the best way of performing a task is to perform {{w|A/B testing}} where a trial is performed where the two strategies, A and B, are implemented and compared. Often the two strategies are simple to implement (for instance, two versions of a web page with different text and colours to determine which provides the better rate of click through) and therefore the amount of time required to implement the strategies (the \"time cost\") could easily be considerably less than the time to determine if the results are statistically significant.\n\nThe title text references a supposed incident in which [[Randall]] did not commence writing a research paper because he spent the entire assignment period deciding whether to learn an entirely different keyboard layout just to potentially be slightly more efficient in his typing speed. It refers to the {{w|Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak}} keyboard layout, an alternative to the most commonly accepted {{w|QWERTY}} layout. Some believe the Dvorak keyboard offers greater typing efficiency. Efficiency of the Dvorak keyboard layout was mentioned in the title text of [[561: Well]], where it was stated that it was not more effective, and by now it has become a [[:Category:Dvorak|recurrent theme]] on xkcd.\n\nOther comics about spending too many resources on decisions that ultimately might not matter include [[309: Shopping Teams]] and [[1801: Decision Paralysis]]. Several other comics address similarly wasted time due to bad time management; see for instance [[1205: Is It Worth the Time?]] or the [[:Category:Time management|Time management]] category.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A bar chart is shown below its title:]\n:<big>'''Time Cost'''</big>\n\n:[The chart consist of a dividing line, with three labels to the left, and the three black bars to the right. The first two bars are short, the second slightly longer than the first. The last bar is much longer, about 13 time as long as the first shortest bar.]\n:Strategy A\n:Strategy B\n:Analyzing whether strategy A or B is more efficient\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:The reason I am so inefficient\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Bar charts]]\n[[Category:Time management]]\n[[Category:Dvorak]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]"
