In the USA, these are now officially termed \"unidentified anomalous/aerial phenomena\" (UAPs), in an attempt to mitigate this type of automatic association, although there are already those who readily adopt the new term as equally indicative of their old opinions.\n\nBeing unidentified, there could be many trivial reasons (and a few {{w|Ball lightning|still very interesting}} non-trivial ones) that could be the truth of any particular observation, without needing to invoke the presence of aliens. But those who believe that UFOs/UAPs are extraterrestrial spacecraft may respond to those who reject this idea with the line, \"These objects have capabilities superior to ours, it would be foolish not to investigate,\" especially in cases where astounding speeds and maneuverability are apparently observed (however much they may be more trivial phenomena, such as camera movement, glints off lenses, or other optical effects) or conveyed by uncorroborated witness statements\n\nThis comic attributes the \"foolish not to investigate\" line to <em>bona fide</em> flying saucers who have chosen to make direct communication with Earth, represented by Cueball (who seems to calmly accept their presence). Whereas skeptical humans may confront UFO believers with evidence that their belief in aliens is unfounded, and argue that it is pointless to continue to promote theories (conspiracy or otherwise) about them, Cueball confronts the flying saucers with evidence that aliens <em>do</em> exist (in the form of themselves), and therefore promoting further unsubstantiated theories would seem redundant in the first degree.\n\nThe aliens we see would [[2572: Alien Observers|surely know]] which vague terrestrial observations were ''actually'' of themselves, and could certainly confirm the existence of themselves in the first place, but seem to conclude that various other 'unidentified' observations on Earth are mysteries worthy of their own wild speculation, concluding that anything that doesn't conform to their own known abilities must be an (additional) alien visitation of some kind. Cueball is annoyed that the occupants of the flying saucers maintain their unfounded beliefs despite lack of solid evidence. Possibly these are the same aliens who are  also shown to be [[2573: Alien Mission|credulous regarding cryptids]]. They reflect the situation of (human) UFO believers, who maintain their beliefs despite the absence of evidence. The aliens also maintain their beliefs in such tenuous observations, despite even the depicted aliens ''themselves'' maintaining that those other events were nothing to do with them. (Though human presumptions about the existence of aliens would, as it turns out, be shown to be correct in cases such as this particular encounter.)\n\nThe title text reports that the extraterrestrials have had no better luck finding evidence for {{w|Chemtrail conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories about \"chemtrails\"}} ({{w|Contrails|vapor trails}}) than have humans, concluding that they are just water/ice particles after testing collected samples. Chemtrails are supposed clouds of gas or other substances deployed by commercial airplanes, which are used to mind-control the population or in some way alter the human population or the environment (depending on who you ask). They have [[966|been]] [[1677|mentioned]] [[2654|before]] on xkcd. Ironically the origin of the ice mentioned in the title text ''is'' jet exhaust â€” if you burn a hydrocarbon (such as the components of jet fuel) the main products will be carbon dioxide and water. At the temperatures and pressures it is released, the water will mostly turn to ice as it nucleates under the local temperature and pressure conditions. However, a significant fraction will later {{w|Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing.
