[[Cueball]] reacts as if she had been gone for years, and admits to having an affair while waiting. \n\nIn this comic, a familiar exchange occurs where one person asks the other why they did not wait. The humor lies in the improbability of him falling in love and having an affair within 90 seconds, the impossibility of him having a son in that time, and the ridiculous notion that the son would now be about Megan's current age. This is of course impossible, as it would imply that Cueball experienced twenty-ish years of life in what felt like 1.5 minutes for Megan. (He might conceivably have managed to have sex in that time span, which would fit with the experience of Cueball in [[1068: Swiftkey]]).\n\n[[Scott]] appears to be a friend of [[Randall]]. Comics 57 through 59 all have the title text ''[[:Category:Opening dialogue by Scott|Opening dialogue by Scott]]'', forming a sort of informal mini-series inspired by him. They are:\n*[[57: Wait For Me]]\n*[[58: Why Do You Love Me?]]\n*[[59: Graduation]]\nAs there already was a comic released on Monday that week, the first of these three was released on Tuesday, then Wednesday and Friday. This may be related to the fact that this was the first week where the comics were not also released on [[LiveJournal]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]\n:Megan: Why didn't you wait for me?\n:Cueball: I thought you were gone forever!\n\n:[Megan throws out her arms, and Cueball is looking down.]\n:Megan: I said I'd be back in a minute!\n:Cueball: The... the seconds went fast at first, but then they started to drag on.\n:Cueball: She was there for me.\n\n:[Same scene as before, except Megan has her arms out less.]\n:Megan: You had an affair in the 90 seconds I was gone?!\n:Cueball: ...yes.\n\n:[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another in a smaller panel.]\n:Cueball: And we had a son.\n\n:[Same scene as before.]\n:Cueball: He'd be about your age now.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Opening dialogue by Scott]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Scott]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
