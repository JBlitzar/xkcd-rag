They were well known for being the most luxurious, comfortable air travel of the time. The {{w|Hindenburg}} disaster, as well as World War II, led to the end of their use as commercial airliners. Also associated with the Zeppelin name is a particular design of wristwatches,[http://www.pointtec.de/zeppelin/] notable for having the word \"ZEPPELIN\" (with no exclamation point) at the top of the dial, at or under where the number 12 would be. In this comic, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] implies that, since the hour hand of the watch is pointing to the word \"ZEPPELIN!,\" it is time for a zeppelin to appear in the sky.\n\nThe joke was continued in [[288: Elevator]], in which replacing a numeral with \"ZEPPELIN!\" also invoked the appearance of a lighter-than-air  airship.\n\nThe title text refers to the webcomic {{w|Buttercup Festival}}, which, at the time of this comic, was defunct. It was later revived by the author then defuncted again in 2015 and revived, again, in 2019. As of 31 March, 2025, the comic is running its third series. It is a tribute to Buttercup festival in the way it interprets things in the world na√Øvely and literally to achieve humor, in a simple yet effective and uncontrived way.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: What time is it?\n:[Picture of a Zeppelin style watch, indicating the time about 12:13 o'clock.]\n:[Cueballs look up at the sky.]\n:[A huge Zeppelin is visible in the sky.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Airships]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
