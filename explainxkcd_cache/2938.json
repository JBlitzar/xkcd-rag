This comic suggests this will happen when both galaxies get into a kissing distance after having slurped the same cosmic spaghetti strand. This is a spoof of a famous scene in the movie ''{{w|Lady and the Tramp}}'', where the titular dogs are eating spaghetti at an Italian restaurant. They happen to be eating the same strand from opposite ends, so they end up meeting in the middle and kissing. This scene was mentioned before in [[2612: Lightsabers]], and {{tvtropes|SpaghettiKiss|has been referenced extensively in other media}}.\n\nThe title text figure of 200 septillion (2×10<sup>26</sup>) calories for the Milky Way-Andromeda noodle equates to approximately 2500 calories per foot of noodle. This value makes sense only if Randall is referring to the physics/chemistry {{w|Calorie|\"small\" calorie}} (= 4.184 joules) rather than the dietary {{w|Calorie|\"large\" Calorie}} (= 4184 joules). Dietary Calories, also called kilocalories (kcal), would be the usual meaning in a food-related context like this one, but Randall was trained as a physicist and apparently used the small calorie here. Having 2.5 dietary Calories per foot is roughly correct for a noodle size between thin spaghetti and angel hair. A noodle with similar ingredients and 2,500 dietary calories per foot would be roughly 26 centimeters in diameter, and might more properly be considered a type of pastry (much to [[Beret Guy]]'s delight).\n\nThe nutritional value of dark matter refers to the fact that evidence of 'dark matter' is particularly found in [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11224 cosmic filaments] and the [https://www.space.com/dark-matter-detected-cosmic-web-filaments-universe-evolution-subaru-telescope cosmic web], implying that such \"cosmic spaghetti\" would have an appreciable amount of dark matter \"sauce\" on it. But, because the exact nature of dark matter is unknown, it is likely even more difficult to identify the calorific content that it might provide. Note that these {{w|galactic filament|filaments}} are much larger structures than the {{w|Local Group}} of galaxies that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two galaxies, positioned on the bottom left and top right sides of the panel, are each eating a single noodle of spaghetti, originating from a bowl of spaghetti in between them.]\n:[Bottom left galaxy:] ''Sluuurp''\n:[Top right galaxy:] ''Sluuurp''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Astronomers have determined that the Milky Way and Andromeda are currently slurping up the same strand of cosmic spaghetti, suggesting that in 5 billion years they will likely kiss.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Cosmology]]"
