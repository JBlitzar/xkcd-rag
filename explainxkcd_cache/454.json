See also {{w|Wireless telephone#Use of mobile phones|Use of mobile phones}}. At the time, people who took their internet access seriously would have preferred that at least some of the phone wiring and phone jacks in their residences were {{w|Ethernet}} ({{w|Cat-5}} or {{w|Cat-6}}) wiring and ({{w|Modular_connector#8P8C|RJ45}}) jacks for providing wired internet access throughout their home, or in this case, to their neighbor's home, so that they wouldn't have to resort to {{w|Wi-Fi}}, which was then slower and less reliable than a wired connection.\n\nSince the faxing of the ethernet cable is apparently successful, the comic is not really about the conversion, but is instead a subtle {{w|computer network}} joke about {{w|Tunneling protocol|tunneling}}, whereby you can embed one kind of network access protocol within a very different protocol. Herein lies the humor: [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are apparently under the impression that they can achieve a faster connection by tunneling a high-speed protocol (ethernet) through a slower (landline telephone service) one. Generally speaking, this is not true. The only exception is when embedding a compressed data stream within a non-compressed standard. The performance boosts, however, are typically modest for {{w|lossless compression}}, and not the orders of magnitude difference our novices apparently hope for.\n\nThe title text suggests that it shows a fanciful way of converting analog phone lines to {{w|digital}} ethernet lines by simply faxing an ethernet cable, since a fax machine is a tool for {{w|digitizing|converting}} analog content into digital. The title text is a reference to foonetic user relsqui and this comic was presumably inspired by [http://www.xkcdb.com/2001 this conversation] they had over IRC.  The reference to \"thread the mail system\" means that instead of digitally faxing one end of an Ethernet cable over an analog phone line to another person, which is not possible, the idea is to place one end of the Ethernet cable into a mailing envelope and drop it in a mailbox, while holding on to the other end (presumably on a long spool).  The mailman would pick up the end in the envelope, and deliver it via the usual means of driving a mail van, sorting through automatic and hand sorting procedures, flying in a cargo plane, driving another mail van, etc, until it reaches the recipient - all while the sender is spooling out enough wire to prevent the cable from breaking.  The end result is to thread an Ethernet cable through the entire mail system from sender to recipient.  For a variety of reasons, this is also not practically possible.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is feeding cable into a device on a desk labeled \"fax.\"]\n:Fax: ''zzzzzz''\n:[Outdoors, showing a plant and a lamp (indicates panels 1 and 3 are separate locations).]\n:[Megan, laptop behind her, is pulling a cable out of a fax machine.]\n:Fax: ''zzzzz''\n\n==Trivia==\nThe title text of this comic was changed to correct user relsqui's name to \"Finn\", after they came out as agender. The original title text was:\n:My friend Elizabeth tried to mail one end of the cable to me and thread the mail system.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Phones]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
