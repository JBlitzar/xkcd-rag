This may be useful in the evening, since blue light interferes with melatonin, the hormone which regulates the sleep cycle. Exposure to intense blue light in the evening can interfere with becoming sleepy.  This comic re-imagines such a mode as influencing the content of messages to encourage sleepinessâ€”or, at least, to dampen [[386: Duty Calls|the emotional response that might keep someone up too late at night]].\n\nIn the title text, the reverse has occurred. By setting his {{w|Color balance|white balance}} incorrectly, the opinions that Randall is reading are more intense, even about \"simple\" things as having visited Colorado or not (instead of his phone display merely becoming too bluish). This may be a play on {{w|angry white male}}, or similar, which is also characterized by violent expressions of views, and uses the word white.  Randall might have meant brightness instead of white balance, with the idea that increasing the amount of light coming from the screen also increases the vehemence of the posts.\n\nThis strip then references the fact that on the internet, very few people answer in the singulars of 'Yes' or 'No' or another equally short and definable answer. This may be because there is little perceived value in such a short but factual answer, when you have the opportunity to voice your opinion, sometimes at length. Also in many cultures indirect expression is the norm, or polite; a short direct answer is considered less acceptable, especially in the negative.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Comments with peoples' profile pictures in front of them are shown in white comment boxes on a gray background.]\n: Cueball: The Atlantic Ocean is big\n:: Ponytail: The Pacific is even bigger\n:: Cueball With Full Body Profile Picture (WFBPP): They're both very big\n\n: Megan: A lot of people have TVs\n:: Hairbun: Some people don't\n:: Megan: Yeah, that's true\n\n: Cueball: 24 isn't a prime number\n:: Cueball WFBPP: Neither is 25\n\n: Hairbun: Have you ever been to Colorado?\n:: Megan: No\n:: Cueball WFBPP: No\n:: Cueball: Yeah\n:: Ponytail: No\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:My phone has a night shift mode to help me sleep, but instead of reducing the intensity of blue light, it reduces the intensity of opinions.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Phones]]"
