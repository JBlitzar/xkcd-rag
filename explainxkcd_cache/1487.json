These seats are traditionally wooden horses. Merry-go-rounds usually rotate slowly, as it is a children's ride.{{Citation needed}} The implication is that a {{w|tornado}} have made a merry-go-round spin much faster, creating the \"fun\" and \"awesome\" experience described by the news commentator. In reality such an event would most likely destroy the merry-go-round or at least damage it in a way that would keep it from spinning, such as by breaking an axle or bearing. Barring damage to the merry-go-round itself, if the tornado caused it to spin much faster than normal, anyone riding it at the time would likely be thrown off and injured due to the increased [[123: Centrifugal Force|centrifugal force]]. \n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Teacups|spinning teacup ride}} which consists of several circular units (\"teacups\") that seat several people each. They rotate around their center axis, while simultaneously orbiting the center of the entire ride, exposing people to acceleration in rapidly shifting, seemingly random directions. The second tornado system, as reported in the title text, had {{w|Multiple-vortex tornado|multiple vortices}}, similarly rotating around a common center, that attached themselves to each of the \"teacups\", also spinning them faster than normal operation of the ride would have. This is, of course, even less likely (to happen, and to result in no injuries if it did) than the single-vortex tornado on a merry-go-round.\n\nTornadoes are a [[:Category:Tornadoes|recurring subject]] on xkcd. This setup is a variety of the [[:Category:News anchor|news anchor category]], but since [[Cueball]] is not in a studio it cannot be included in that category.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is a news commentator holding a microphone while standing in front of a small village with three (intact) houses behind him.]\n:Cueball: The tornado touched down directly over a merry-go-round, in what victims are calling a \"fun\" and \"awesome\" disaster.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes]]"
