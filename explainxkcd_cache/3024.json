The METAR follows a specific structure and makes heavy usage of abbreviations, which makes it hard to read for anyone not familiar with it. The comic makes fun of that by assuming meanings of the METAR words based on what non-aviation people might think they mean. The METAR in the comic is fairly alarming, describing dangerously fast winds, a possible tornado, freezing volcanic ash (in New York!), lightning, and impossibly high atmospheric pressure.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Code !! Real meaning !! Comic text !! Meaning according to the comic\n|-\n| METAR\n| Type: Meteorological Aerodrome Report\n| \"METER\" (usually misspelled)\n| The comic assumes that this is just a spelling error and it should be \"meter\" (or, indeed, \"{{wiktionary|metre#Usage notes|metre}}\").\n|-\n| KNYC\n| Station ID: 4 character identifier; for an airport, this would be the {{w|ICAO airport code|ICAO code}}. In this instance the identifier represents the automated weather station at Belvedere Castle in Central Park, Manhattan, New York City. Airport, weather and radio station call signs share a common heritage.\n| Station ID\n| \"Station ID\", which is actually correct, although people unfamiliar with METAR-reporting stations could presume that this is a radio or TV broadcaster's call sign. Among radio stations, KNYC is not a current call sign (though {{w|WNYC}} is, and indeed serves New York City), while [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3T7tVrVF2jeyHMa1k427mg KNYC-TV] is a television station based in Brooklyn.\n|-\n| 251600Z\n| Time of observation: 25th day of the month at 4 PM UTC. Z is not part of the time, but simply global shorthand for {{w|Military time zone|\"Zulu\" time}}, i.e. {{w|Coordinated Universal Time|UTC}}. Normally most stations would report at a particular time every hour, in this particular case either 15:51 or 16:51 would apply, but more frequent reports are made during unusual and rapidly changing weather events (as may be the situation, in this case).\n| Time (25:16:002)\n| Misreading the \"25\" as the hour instead of the day, pushing the trailing zeros into seconds which METAR doesn't use, and \"Z\" as a 2 on the end of seconds, all resulting in a nonsensical time.\n|-\n| 18035G45KT\n| Wind direction and speed: Wind direction 180° (directly from the south, degrees based on 0°=true north), speed 35 knots, gusting to 45 knots. This is quite stormy weather.\n| Wind speed has been 18,035 knots for a good 45 minutes now\n| Instead of interpreting the first 5 digits as direction and speed, it is assumed that it is one big number and the G45 stands for the time span in which this was observed with \"G\" standing for \"good\". 18,035 knots is an unrealistically high wind speed, faster than orbital velocity; the {{w|jet stream}} typically contains the highest winds on Earth, and may reach about 250 knots.\n|-\n| 6SM\n| [https://weather.cod.edu/notes/metar.html#:~:text=6SM%2DVisibility,SM)%20up%20to%2010%20SM 6 statute miles of visibility], meaning that objects can be seen clearly up to 6 miles away. This indicates clear enough weather to fly without instruments; the value has a max range of 10SM.\n| Observer is a size 6 small\n| The comic interprets \"6SM\" to humorously mean a \"Size '''6 Sm'''all\".\n|-\n| VCFCFZVA\n| In the vicinity (VC): funnel cloud (FC) and freezing (FZ) volcanic ash (VA). This sounds somewhat unusual for New York City.{{Citation needed}}\n| Sorry, the station cat walked on the keyboard\n| A riff on the repeated letters which give off the impression the string is constructed by random keypresses on the keyboard, as exemplified by a [[1689: My Friend Catherine|cat on the keyboard]]. There is a long history of this problem, as well as [http://bitboost.com/pawsense/ attempted solutions].\nThis string may or may not actually look like the pattern of characters that a walking cat could produce (and be reliably detected). All the letters are in a cluster at the lower left of the (QWERTY) keyboard, with some adjacently paired characters perhaps indicative of stepping on multiple keys and other neighbouring keys having been stepped over, not uncommon of an oblivious feline wandering across your desk. But the repeated cluster of \"CFCF\", and other implied paw-press events, seem less likely to emerge even from a rapid quadrupedal gait. A more casual stroll would likely also create single-character duplications, unless the keyboard repeat delay was set unnaturally high. It could, though, come from a repeated pawing at the keyboard.\n|-\n| +BLUP\n| Heavy (+) blowing (BL) unknown precipitation (UP)\n| Weird noise the sky made earlier\n| Riffing on the fact that it looks like an onomatopoetic word\n|-\n| NOSIG\n| No significant change is expected to the reported conditions within the next 2 hours\n| Observer has no significant other :(\n| The comic assumes that the transmitter of the METAR report wants the receivers to know that they do not have a significant other, which the comic finds sad. The observer could be trying to abuse the METAR report as a dating platform.\n|-\n| LTG OHD\n| Lightning overhead \n| We overheard someone saying there was lightning\n| OHD is interpreted as \"overheard\" instead of \"overhead\", indicating that they did not observe it themselves and instead just overheard people talking about it.\n|-\n| A3808\n| Altimeter setting: the (calculated) air pressure corresponding to {{w|Mean_sea_level|mean sea level}} at the airport is 38.08 {{w|Inch_of_mercury|inches of mercury (inHg)}} (\"A\" is for inHg, used primarily in USA, Canada and Japan; \"Q\" would indicate a value in hPa).  The value of 38.08 is extremely high: the standard atmospheric pressure used in aviation is 29.92 inHg, and [https://learn.weatherstem.com/modules/learn/lessons/125/18.html the highest recorded surface pressure on Earth was 32.01 inHg]. This is used to adjust the altimeter in the aircraft to the local air pressure, instead of using the standard setting used in higher air spaces.\n| Hey look, an Airbus A380-800!\n| The comic says that the observer saw an {{w|Airbus_A380|Airbus A380-800}}, a very large passenger plane. Note: The {{w|List_of_ICAO_aircraft_type_designators|ICAO aircraft type code}} for the Airbus A380-800 is A388 and not A3808.\n|-\n| RMK\n| Beginning of the section with remarks\n| Remarkable!\n| Remarkable. Likely a comment about the A380 (as stated previously, it is quite large).\n|-\n| AO2\n| The weather station is automated (A) and has a precipitation discriminator (O2), which can tell the difference between liquid and frozen precipitation.\n| Fanfic archive equipped with a precipitation sensor\n| A reference to the {{w|fan fiction|fanfic}} site [https://archiveofourown.org/ Archive of Our Own], often abbreviated as AO3 ('''A'''rchive '''o'''f '''O'''ur '''O'''wn, or \"AOOO\"). It's nonsensical to describe this site as having a precipitation discriminator.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n| SLP130=\n| {{w|Sea_level_pressure|Sea-level pressure}} is 1013.0 hPa (approx. 29.91 inHg). The equals sign signifies the end of the METAR.\n| Observer got sleepy around 1:30\n| \"SLP\" interpreted as abbreviation for sleepy, the numbers as a time, and the = sign as \"around\" (maybe confused with ≈)\n|-\n| NOTAM (title text)\n| Not part of a METAR report, but instead another aviation abbreviation. It stands for {{w|NOTAM|Notice to Air Missions}} (previously Notice to Airmen).\n| All times are assumed to be AM unless they're labeled NOTAM.\n| Parsed as \"not A.M.\", indicating that a given time is to be interpreted as P.M. While AM and PM are indeed not used in aviation, as the comic says, they use a 24-hour clock system, not an \"A.M.-by-default\" 12-hour clock system.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:Decoding a METAR report:\n\n:[A METAR report is shown with annotations above and below.

The METARs report that the station needs maintenance, as indicated by the dollar sign.\n\n     If the comic's message is based off of some pre-existing METARS message, it may be from 25/Nov/2024, which is before the KNYC 291351Z message that is the earliest I can currently retrieve. Would still be interesting to get KNYC 251551Z and KNYC 251651Z, though, for November, and give it the same treatment.\n\n     On the other hand, probably intended to be 25/Dec/2024 (and hence technically a 'Christmas comic', in all but name?), but of course it's not easy to get the actual (neighbouring) METAR messages for then, yet. If you can, I'd please also like to know the Lottery numbers (and *which* Lottery you're giving me). But perhaps consider this a placeholder request for the Christmas Day message(s) to be supplied here, as and when? \n-->\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Weather]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]"
