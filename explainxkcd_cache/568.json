Ow, stop throwing pennies.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic follows the original, [[561: Well]]. The average person's lifespan is 80 years now. So, while immortality may become a reality within the coming century, [[Ponytail]] won't live long enough to achieve it. [[Cueball]] is looking for a programming language that does not need him to be specific about his ideas. When humans communicate ideas to other humans they may be vague but still understood, since the listener can infer a lot of detail from context and basic knowledge. Until we start 'raising' compilers (like you would a child) compilers will not possess that feature. Hence the need for the programmer to be exact in communicating his ideas to the compiler. No language will ever be able to change that. Cueball complains that '''he''' knows what he means, perhaps hoping that {{w|DWIM|this is perfectly sufficient}}.\n\nFinally, we find out that one of [[Megan]]'s admirers, Mike, whom she avoids, is hiding in the well. He has been waiting for her to come for her ''uncomfortable truth'', so he can make her believe that she is actually attracted to him. But she is not so easily fooled and calls his bluff, telling him to come out of the well. In [[1608: Hoverboard]], there is also a well in the left part of the world. It has the same type of covered top and, at the bottom, there is a girl with a coin a coin, like the one thrown into a wishing well. Here are the [http://xkcd.com/1608/980:-1077+s.png top] and the [http://xkcd.com/1608/980:-1073+s.png bottom] of the well from [[1608: Hoverboard]].\n\nThe title text suggests he might also have been down there for the money everyone is throwing in to the \nwell to get this uncomfortable truth. So it has never been a working well. When everyone (or just Megan) finds out about this, Mike is bombarded with the all the pennies people have brought along.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four people are lined up by a covered well, Ponytail in front followed by Cueball, Megan, and Beret Guy (only half of his head is shown).
