I hope it wasn't the Richard Stallman Cirque de Soleil thing again.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Firefox}} is a popular browser, and in 2006, it was the second most commonly used browser. Its more fervent supporters sometimes wrote as if there was a moral imperative to use Firefox rather than alternatives. [[Cueball]], presumably representing [[Randall]], wakes up with a reasonable perspective on the relative unimportance of an internet browser within the world at large, but quickly loses that perspective as his enthusiasm for nerdy things like Firefox gets the better of him. The humor stems from the irony that Cueball is relieved to trade a richer perspective for a simpler, browser-oriented world view. Alternately, the dream may be a reference to Stallman's forceful defense of software freedom, which could be seen as \"over-the-top\" or circus-like. Another possible joke is that the comic, unlike most other xkcd comics, is drawn with {{w|Perspective (graphical)|perspective}} as well as being about a more metaphorical perspective.\n\nThe title text references {{w|Richard Matthew Stallman|Richard Stallman}}, an American software freedom activist and computer programmer, and {{w|Cirque du Soleil}}, an entertainment company specializing in big-top circus performances. The two have no connection with one another, so this is one example of an odd combination of topics that would only (and commonly) be connected in dreams.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Sometimes, when I first wake up, I am caught in the horrible grip of perspective.\n:[Cueball sitting up in bed.]\n:Cueball: It may be a jewel of open source, but Firefox is '''just a browser.''' It shows '''webpages.''' What the hell is '''wrong''' with us?\n:Fortunately, this subsides quickly.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring [[Richard Stallman]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Richard Stallman]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
