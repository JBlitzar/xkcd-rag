They went unerased for months. If you see this, feel free to replace the URL with xkcd.com.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nDNE stands for \"do not erase,\" and is commonly used on school whiteboards to let the sanitation staff and other teachers know not to erase that particular area of the board. DNE circles often encompass important information such as test dates or the teacher's name.\n\nIt is easy to see how leaving things marked with DNE can become automatic for anyone often erasing boards, so that they don't notice what the message actually says, or reflect on whether the DNE-marking is reasonable for it. [[Cueball]]'s dissatisfactory note is not very subtle, but [[Randall]] notes in the title text that advertisers have successfully used the same tactic for less conspicuous {{w|URL}}s to their sites. He also kindly asks you to replace those messages with xkcd.com to get some free advertising.\n\nOn the bottom half of the board is a crossed out 2x2 {{w|Matrix (mathematics)|matrix}} and two {{w|Function (mathematics)|functions}} for {{w|Exponential decay| exponential decay}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is in an empty classroom writing on the whiteboard. In the top right corner in large print is written \"Fuck This Place!\". It is circled, and underneath he is writing \"DNE\".]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]"
