The sign text is based on the {{w|Wikipedia:Citation needed|Wikipedia template}} that can be placed next to statements that need citations, usually because of questionable validity. (It looks like this: {{Citation needed}}) Cueball is using this template to challenge the politician's speech, as political speakers often throw out claims having dubious or no factual basis. This comic was posted on {{w|Independence Day}} in 2007, which may explain its focus on classically American issues such as free speech, protest, and the Constitution (as well as the presence of the country's flag on the podium).\n\nThe title text represents an alternative sign the protester could be holding. It is a pun on popular phrase \"protect the Constitution\", which urges politicians to pass and enforce laws in a way that preserves the rules and rights set down by the {{w|Constitution of the United States|U.S. constitution}}. \"Semi-protect\" is a reference to the {{w|Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy|Wikipedia semi-protection policy}}, which is used to prevent important articles from being edited anonymously or by new users. Semi-protection on an article is shown by displaying this lock [[File:semi-protection-lock.png|12px]] on the top right of an article. Constitutional amendments are proposed by Congress, which isn't anonymous, meaning that in effect, all articles of the Constitution are technically already semi-protected. Funnily enough, the \"{{w|Constitution}}\" and \"{{w|Constitution of the United States}}\" articles on Wikipedia are now semi-protected due to excessive vandalism.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A man (presumably some sort of electoral candidate) with flat, dark hair is standing at a podium. He is speaking to a crowd while standing behind a lectern. The lectern has a microphone on the top and sports an American flag in color on the side. He holds an arm on the lectern and the other arm is held up in front of him with a finger pointing upwards. There are four red stars on the side of the podium below him and behind him something that could be high curtains. There is an empty gap between the podium and the first people in the crowd followed by a stick with a red top, which indicates a fence to keep the crowd at a distance from the podium. After the fence there is a large crowd of people listening, most of them only partly drawn, and a lot of them lacking hair. Three signs can be seen above the heads of the crowd, but two are just blank white, except for one in the middle of the crowd. There, a Cueball has been raised above the rest of the crowd (possibly on someone else's shoulders) while holding a large sign above his head in both hands. The sign has underlined blue text in black square brackets:]\n:<big>[<font color=\"blue\"><u>Citation needed</u></font>]</big>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Randall's ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' blog and [[explain xkcd|this wiki]] use the {{Template|Citation needed}} template as a joke, after statements that are blatantly obvious. For example, \"The light from the Sun illuminates the Earth.{{Citation needed}}\". On this wiki, clicking the template leads to this comic's explanation instead of the {{w|Wikipedia:Citation needed}} page. Because of this, this wiki instead uses the {{tl|Actual citation needed}} template for statements that are unsourced and require actual reliable citations.
