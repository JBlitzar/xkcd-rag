He then extends it to 8 feet (approx. 2.5 meters), wondering whether or not that was a record, which makes him imagine a sport where extending the tape measure as far as possible was the goal. \n\n{{w|Tape measure}} strips, of the 'spring metal' kind are manufactured with a slight inherent curve upwards, laterally, where not curved along their length (e.g. whilst still on the spool). Extending the tape straight out from the spool, the sideways curve dominates and adds structural strength to ''keep'' the relatively light tape-strip supported against gravity. By doing so, it allows fairly easy operation to extend a tape upwards (e.g. from the floor to the ceiling of a room) or for a smaller distance sideways (e.g. the width of a picture-window) without needing a second person or the extra effort of hooking the 'end hook' over something at the 'end-point' before pulling the case back fowards the 'start'. The tape can also still be bent around corners or circumferences, at the loss of local longitudinal strength and perhaps some accuracy, if a single straight-line distance isn't desired. It is this combination of flexibility and rigidity that makes such tapes so useful for common household and maintenance measurements larger than a piece of paper (for which a rigid ruler is more useful) but smaller than a property's yard area (where a surveyor's non-sprung metal tape might be laid out) and not habitually involving curves (as with a draper's cloth tape).\n\nHowever, as a tape measure is extended (especially horizontally), the weight of the strip eventually does overcome the support offered by the bend, causing it to collapse. As cleverly depicted in the comic, a single point tends to 'crumple' (often where vibrations from the handling induce a resonance; and tending towards where the cantilever forces are greatest, near where the operator is currently drawing the tape out) and this then causes a collapse in which other bends introduce themselves from the dynamics of the tape in motion and the force of its impact on the ground/other objects.\n\nSkillfully and steadily holding the tape measure at an angle can redirect some of the weight load, reduce the momentary tendencies to cross the 'bending threshold' and allow for a longer total extension. Vertically, it is likely that most such tape can support itself (with minimal care) against collapse, but would reach no length at all in a sideways direction. The ultimate aim of those who attempt idle 'tape extending' challenges is often to achieve the longest ''horizontal'' extension. Or the highest 'figure' revealed from the tape, whilst doing so, which would actually be the length of the slightly arced diagonal, but would be fairly close to the slightly smaller 'reach length' attained, and usually good enough for idle entertainment. However, it is implied that this technique can be explored to the point of becoming its own sport, at which point one presumes that professional \"competitive tape extension\" would rely solely upon the observed horizontal extension (without, or prior to, hitting the ground), with competitor's chosen extension techniques with their standard (competition-grade) tapes perhaps even making on-tape graduations unnecessary and totally irrelevent.\n\nThe title text refers to a future where this sport exists, and this comic is a representation of the origin of this sport.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball finds a tape measure.]\n:Cueball: Hey, a tape measure.\n\n:[Cueball extends the tape measure.]\n:''extend extend''\n\n:[The tape measure falls.]\n:''clatter''\n\n:[Cueball tries again.]\n:''click''\n:''schwoop''\n\n:''extend extend''\n\n:''extend''\n\n:Cueball (thinking): Ooh, eight feet.
