Even grandmasters who have built up a tolerance lose the ability to play for a few hours after studying it.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\n[[Cueball]] talks to [[Ponytail]] about a chess game he had last week against [[Knit Cap]]. After Cueball made a {{w|blunder (chess)|blunder}}, a critically bad mistake which frequently changes the course of the game, both of them quickly made inaccurate moves, probably rated as a \"{{w|Blunder (chess)|blunder}}\", \"mistake\", or \"miss\", leading to an odd configuration of the chess pieces. Blunders that are not taken advantage of can lead to this effect for less experienced players. \n\nThe rest of this comic becomes absurd, as Cueball then describes himself and Knit Cap descending into a fantasy world \"on a deep branch of the game tree.\" However, it seems that Cueball and Knit Cap each made a sequence of seemingly obvious blunders that neither opponent then took advantage of, reaching a board configuration that Cueball had never even anticipated happening. Ponytail reacts nonchalantly to this story, as she says this is a common scenario for new players, and that there is even a defined name for it: the Kasparov Vortex Gambit. Ponytail's advice to Cueball after he \"recovers\" from the disillusionment of the \"vortex\" is that she can teach him how to defend against the attack, by using the f pawn.\n\nIn the title text, Ponytail continues with her advice, telling Cueball that he needs to understand how the vortex can be entered, but not to study the actual vortex. It appears that if you spend too much time focusing on the vortex you will [[356: Nerd Sniping|lose your ability]] to play chess. Even experienced players, such as grandmasters who have built up some kind of tolerance against the effect of the vortex, lose their chess abilities for a few hours after studying it. Thus being able to get your opponent into the vortex, without getting caught in it yourself, should win you the game, since they would lose their ability to play chess.\n\n===Chess strategy===\nChess strategy is commonly described in terms of following a {{w|decision tree}} or {{w|game tree}}, as one usually needs to calculate multiple moves ahead when planning out what move to play. As a chess game progresses, the {{w|phase space}} of possible positions increases wildly, though this will include many more configurations than are typically seen or anticipated by players. Rarely, an expert player may 'discover' a truly clever {{w|Glossary of chess#theoretical novelty|novel opening}}, but centuries of recorded gameplay has explored many of the possible moves, both good and not so good, that are often recognized by experienced students of the game as common stepping-stones on the way to possible victory (or frequent traps that send the unwary down the road to defeat). Both precise game-board states and more general variations may be easily recognized by an experienced player, and even be {{w|Checkmate pattern|given a name}} by the player community as a whole.\n\nIn some apparently mystical (or at least psychological) manner, by travelling such an unlikely and unfamiliar branch of the player/board game-space, the precise positioning of pieces combined with the state of mind that Cueball had developed created the impression of literally entering a mythical garden, with time even stopping. This could be a reference to the story \"The door behind the wall\" by HG Wells in which the protagonist explains to the personal that he is haunted by trying to find a door leading to a mystical garden, which he had stumbled across before. In chess, you want pieces to be in a position to attack other pieces, while at the same time being protected by other pieces. Typically you'd have some pieces on the offense, some playing defense, and some doing both. It seems that in this board configuration, somehow all the pieces ended up in both offensive attack positions able to attack every other piece on the board while at the same time each one was being protected by against attack by their other pieces. It was this perfect balance of position and protection that led to the time distortion and the magical garden.\n\nEvery piece being attacked at once is impossible under standard rules. If all of the pieces are being attacked, that includes both kings. It is illegal to end your turn with your king under attack; if you have no way to do so, the game ends, in checkmate if your king started the turn under attack or in stalemate if it did not. Alternatively, Cueball might not be including the king in \"every piece\", or simply might not have literally meant that every piece was under attack.\n\n{{w|Garry Kasparov}} is a Russian chess grandmaster and former world champion. He was the number-one rated chess player from 1984 to 2005, and is considered one of the greatest chess players of all past time, if not ''the'' greatest. A {{w|gambit (chess)|gambit}} refers to a chess opening in which a player sacrifices material with the aim of achieving a subsequent positional advantage. This name seems to indicate that Kasparov himself either discovered/’invented’ or made popular this \"gambit\" to suck new players into a \"vortex\" and trap them from getting out. This is not the case, but, within the xkcd universe, he has performed an equally absurd gambit (also named after himself) in [[2936: Exponential Growth]].\n\nThe f pawn is the pawn that begins on the f file (the 6th column of the chessboard from white's perspective, which is designated with the 6th letter of the alphabet since rows are designated by numbers). The pawn would start either on f2 (sixth column, second row) for the white player or f7 (sixth column, seventh row) for black. The fact that an apparent distortion in the fabric of space can be countered with ''a single pawn'' just adds to the absurdity of the situation. Equally absurd is the fact that moving the f pawn early in the game is itself usually a blunder that exposes the king to a {{w|Fool's mate|diagonal attack}}, due to its starting position relative to the starting position of the king; perhaps the intent is to purposefully go down a ''different'' (non-vortexed) branch of the game-tree with resulting board positions that are far less mesmerising (at least to Cueball).\n\nThis comic has similarities to [[224: Lisp]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In the first panel, Cueball is walking in from the left, while talking to Ponytail.]\n:Cueball: Something odd happened to me last week in a game at the chess club.\n\n:[Cueball is playing a game of chess against Knit Cap.]\n:[Caption above frame:]\n:I moved, then instantly realized I'd blundered. But my opponent didn't notice and made a weird move.\n:I got rattled and moved almost randomly, then I think we both panicked and made a couple of nonsensical moves, rapid-fire.\n\n:[Zoomed in on Cueball, with three question marks above his head]\n:I don't know how it happened, but suddenly I realized I was staring at an indescribably strange board position.\n\n:[Cueball is talking to Ponytail.]\n:Cueball: I've never seen anything like it. It seemed like every move attacked every piece, yet every piece was also protected. Pieces refracted through crystalline pawn structures.\n:Cueball: The game clock slowed and then stopped.\n\n:[Cueball and Knit Cap are floating in a complex five-fold symmetrical plant-like pattern of \"game tree branches\".]\n:[Caption above the frame]\n:It didn't even feel like we were playing chess. We had stumbled into a magical garden tucked away on a deep branch of the game tree.\n\n:[Cueball is talking to Ponytail.]\n:Cueball: I don't remember how the game ended, if it did. \n:Cueball: I don't remember how I got home. \n:Cueball: It's all a blur.\n\n:[Close-up of Cueball's head.]\n:Cueball: I've spent all week trying to reconstruct the position and can't.\n:Cueball: It's consuming me.\n:Cueball: I don't want to play chess. I just want to return to that garden.\n:Cueball: Does... any of this make sense to you?\n\n:[Cueball is standing with hands on face surprised as Ponytail talks with him.]\n:Ponytail: Yeah, that's the Kasparov Vortex Gambit. Common trap for new players.\n:Cueball: ''What?!''\n:Ponytail: Once you recover I'll show you how to block it with the f pawn.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Knit Cap]]\n[[Category:Chess]]"
