A {{w|wave function}} is a mathematical description of a quantum system which uses {{w|complex number|complex}} values - numbers that have both a {{w|real number|real}} part and an {{w|imaginary number|imaginary}} part. Multiplying a wavefunction by its complex conjugate is a common thing to do, as it yields the probability density of where a particle is likely to be found, which is a real-valued function.\n\nComplex numbers can be written in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and bi is the imaginary part. i is the imaginary unit, defined so that i² = -1. The {{w|complex conjugate}} of a complex number simply reverses the sign on the imaginary part - so for the number above, the complex conjugate is a - bi.\n\nMultiplying the complex number by its own complex conjugate therefore yields (a + bi)(a - bi). If you multiply out the brackets, you get a² + abi - abi - b²i². The abi cancel each other out, and i² can be replaced by -1. Thus, the result is a² + b², a real number, so \"shit just got real\" as Cueball promised.\n\nThe title text notes that you can make this joke in class every time a calculation is performed that drops the imaginary part from a complex number, but warns that it would be so annoying that the professor will eventually find a way to have the class without you in it. Because nonreal numbers are often considered to have no physical significance, turning them into real numbers to produce a final answer is so common that this joke would quickly become tedious.\n\nThe wave function shown on Cueball's board is the {{w|Schrödinger_equation|time-dependent Schrödinger equation}} <math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H}\\Psi</math>, a {{w|Differential equation|differential equation}} that the {{w|Wavefunction|wavefunction}} Ψ, which determines the possible positions of a quantum particle over time, always satisfies. The {{w|Derivative#Partial_derivatives|derivative}} should be written with ∂Ψ on the top; the omission of the Ψ may be a mistake.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, holding a marker pen down in one hand, is standing at a whiteboard with two equations, one of which is the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and the other shows what the wavefunction equals, but from there it becomes unreadable. Below is a graph with a bell-shaped curve. There are also other unreadable markings on the board below the second equation and next to the graph.]\n:Cueball: Okay, anyone who's feeling like they can't handle the physics here should probably just leave now.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel Cueball is seen writing on the whiteboard. This is seen from the side of the board, so it is just a thin line with a shelf at the bottom for putting the pen on.]\n:Cueball: Because I'm multiplying the wavefunction by its complex conjugate.\n:Cueball: That's right.\n\n:[Dramatic zoom in on Cueball appears to be writing the final part of his next equation.]\n:Cueball: Shit just got ''real''.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Fun fact]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
