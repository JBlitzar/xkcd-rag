    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1689\n| date      = June 3, 2016\n| title     = My Friend Catherine\n| image     = my_friend_catherine.png\n| titletext = I can't get any work done because my friend Catherine is sitting on my keyboard.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is another comic using [[:Category:Substitutions|substitutions]] to create the joke by replacing words or phrases, in this case \"My cat\", with a different word or phrase, in this case \"My friend Catherine\" (hence the title). The choice of the name is probably because \"Cat\" is a common nickname for \"Catherine\".\n\nBy doing so in a list of [[#The original posts|people discussing things their cat did]], it makes it seem like they are discussing things their female human friend did.  What is cute (sitting on keyboards), impressive (doing backflips to eat bugs), or at least normal behavior for a cat (vomiting hairballs) would be weird, disgusting or disturbing if an adult human were to do it, which is what makes the substitution humorous.\n\nThe comic depicts a feed on a page for people discussing their cat, similar to Twitter or Facebook, which would be the only kind of place where the substitution is really funny. Apart from known characters like two looking like [[Cueball]], [[Megan]] and [[Ponytail]], there is also a person with black hair, not looking particularly like any standard characters, and then a person with a [[1350:_Lorenz#Knit_Cap_Girl|knit cap]], which could be the same knit cap wearing user that was also used in [[1506: xkcloud]] (see the [[1506:_xkcloud/Transcript#User_pictures| pictures of the users]]).\n\n===The original posts===\n*My cat just did a backflip and then ate a bug!\n*I wish my cat wouldn't wake me up by chewing on my hair.\n*Oh no, my cat has learned to open the refrigerator.\n*My cat just walked in, threw up on the rug, and walked out.\n*My cat is looking out the window making weird noises at the birds.\n*I wish my cat wouldn't make eye contact with me while pooping.\n*I can't get any work done because my cat is sitting on my keyboard.
