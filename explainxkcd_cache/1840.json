The bad news is that it's a risk factor for a lot of things.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Ponytail]] [[1839|continues]] [[Cueball]]'s medical checkup with a genetic test. {{w|Genetic test}}s show people genetic diseases that they might be at risk for and/or give them insight into their ancestry. In this case, the genetic results are extremely obvious: His genes are part of a long line of genes stretching back to some of the earliest life forms to have genes. This information is universally true - ''every'' known organism has such a genetic history - which makes it so vague as to be useless for either medicine or ancestry.\n\nIn epidemiology, a risk factor is a variable associated with an increased risk of disease or infection. The title text says that this is a risk factor because being a living organism is, trivially, associated with every disease that exists.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is seated on an medical examination table while Ponytail stands dressed in a doctor's coat holding a file in her right hand.]\n:Ponytail: Your genetic test results are back. Apparently you're part of an unbroken lineage stretching back billions of years to the early Earth!\n\n==Trivia==\n*Randall has previously joked about what should be the obvious results of genetic testing in [[830: Genetic Analysis]].\n\n*Randall makes a similar joke in the title text to [[674: Natural Parenting]]: \"On one hand, every single one of my ancestors going back billions of years has managed to figure [having kids] out. On the other hand, that's the mother of all sampling biases.\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Doctor Ponytail]]"
