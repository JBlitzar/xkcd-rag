The prologue states that due to the {{w|2008 financial crisis}}, only very few images of the strip could be produced. This leaves the others to be blacked out. It is therefore left to the reader to reconstruct the whole story based on the given images. While it is claimed that the reconstruction should be rather easy, the complicated and abstruse plot-line makes it nearly impossible to fill the gaps. Any attempt at inferring the missing images would therefore be largely guesswork. The comic features the well-known xkcd characters getting involved in a strange fight with cyborgs and raptors on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe line \"We apologize for the inconvenience.\" is possibly a reference to the famous book series ''{{w|The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy}}'' by {{w|Douglas Adams}}. It appears there as God's Final Message to His Creation, written in letters of fire on the side of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains.\n\n'''Panel 2\n\n: [[Megan]] strives to outdo some Christmas lights she has seen on YouTube.\n\n; Panel 3\n\n: Dissatisfied with her work, Megan is thinking about alternative ways to improve her light arrangement. The idea of firing {{w|Sodium}} pellets into snow is probably a bad one, as Sodium reacts exothermically with water and may, in large amounts, induce explosions.\n\n; Panel 5\n\n: Probably still obsessed with creating a large and impressive light display, Megan has constructed an electronic device with an {{w|Arduino}} processor, perhaps to make the light chain show patterns. However, the energy she used was too high. This causes one of the control boards to sublimate, i.e. go directly from a solid to a gaseous state without an intermediate liquid phase. She then wishes she could make the system self-repairing.\n\n; Panel 7\n\n: Megan's device has developed {{w|artificial intelligence}}, allowing it to feel. This is presumably a result of Megan attempting to make the device self-repairing. This common trope in science-fiction works usually leads to the system's attempt to eradicate its creator. [[Cueball]] attributes the emergence of a personality to the awesome ease and power of programming in {{w|Python (programming language)|Python}}.\n\n; Panel 11\n\n: Out of context, this panel introduces the idea of {{w|Santa Claus}} being a {{w|Muslim}}. This may be a reference to the persistent Internet rumours that Barack Obama is a Muslim, though he declares himself to be a Christian. However, the statement could also relate to the fact that Santa Claus is usually displayed with a large beard, which is sometimes also sported by conservative Muslims. Or it could just be nonsensical.\n\n; Panel 13\n\n: At this point, the self-aware Christmas light control systems have released {{w|cyborgs}} that tried to kill Megan and Cueball. To repel the cyborgs, they have cloned {{w|Velociraptors}}. Cueball expresses doubt about whether that was a good idea. Velociraptors appear frequently in xkcd, as seen in [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Velociraptors these comics]\n\n; Panel 17\n\n: As predicted, the raptors have gone wild, but Megan, Cueball and the two smaller characters (perhaps their children) managed to cage the dinosaurs. They believe themselves safe unless the raptors learn how to build {{w|lightsabers}}. This is a reference to a line in {{w|'' Jurassic Park''}} where the main characters believe themselves safe until they discover the raptors can learn how to open doors.\n\n; Panel 19\n\n: The raptors have indeed succeeded with constructing lightsabers and must now be fought. The \"Clever girl\" refers to a line from ''Jurassic Park'' where the raptors outflank (and kill) one of the human characters wearing a similar hat. “Snap-hiss” is a common phrase originated by Timothy Zahn to describe the sound of a lightsaber igniting in Star Wars literature.<ref>Zahn, Timothy, \"Author Annotations: Chapter 7, 1\", Star Wars: Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition, ISBN 0345530004, \"I thought long and hard about how to write the sound of an igniting lightsaber. I finally went with snap-hiss.\", corroborated by [https://boards.theforce.net/threads/snap-hiss.25830511/ forums]</ref>\n\n; Panel 23\n\n: IT billionaire {{w|Bill Gates}} has mistakenly killed Santa Claus, possibly in a sword fight. He claims to have mistaken him for [[Richard Stallman]], a prominent {{w|free software}} activist. (Gates strongly opposes the idea of free software and is therefore considered an antagonist by many of its supporters.) The most striking resemblance between Stallman and Santa Claus is probably the long and untamed beard. [[225: Open Source]] features Stallman involved in a sword fight. Much later, [[Randall]] again killed off Santa in his Christmas comics, and did so twice in only three years. First in [[2559: December 25th Launch]], from 2021, and then again in 2023's [[2872: Hydrothermal Vents]].\n\n; Panel 29\n\n: [[Black Hat]] is asked by Megan (or possibly his companion, [[Danish]]) where he obtained the enormously large {{w|Christmas tree}} that can be seen on the right side of the zoomed out picture. It is implied that he felled {{w|Yggdrasil}}, the giant ash tree of Norse mythology. According to tradition, Yggdrasil is the world tree representing the whole of creation and holding together the cosmological structure.\n\n; Panel 31\n\n: [[Randall]] wishes Merry Christmas to all xkcd readers.\n\nThe title text refers to panel 7. In Python, modules are imported using the \"import ''module''\" syntax. {{w|Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet}} is a self-aware artificial intelligence system featured in the ''{{w|Terminator}}'' film series as the main influence behind most of the antagonists. Importing the Skynet module might therefore account for Megan's system's developing an evil personality.\n\nThere is an actual pip module [https://pypi.org/project/skynet/ named \"skynet\"]. The module links to the comic as its \"homepage\". The module's description says that it \"demonstrates the usage of Python's exit-hook, exception hook and signals handling\", by using them to prevent the user from exiting Python \"to the best of its ability\" when the module is imported (somewhat in line with the whole idea of a rogue computer), and cautions you to try this at your own risk.\n\nNote that this comic was first published in another version that had panel 29 as panel 27 and the \"Merry Christmas from xkcd\" message at the bottom. As 27 is not a {{w|prime number}}, the current version was published in place of the erroneous one.\n\nIt has been observed that the top left nine panels have the configuration of a {{w|Glider (Conway's Life)|Glider}} in ''{{w|Conway's Game of Life}}''. The glider is sometimes used as an emblem representing {{w|hacker subculture}}, although rotated by 90 degrees. However, it remains unclear whether the occurrence in the comic is intentional or an incidental side-effect of the prime number pattern in use. If you put the shown comic panels in The Game of Life, it turns into a Beehive, for reasons also probably not deliberate, unlike [[2293: RIP John Conway|a later comic]]'s explicit invocation of this mechanism. The last fourteen black panels also coincidentally form the shape of a crewmate from the game ''{{w|Among Us}}'', although the comic predates the game by a whole decade.\n\n==Transcript==\n:The 2008 XKCD Christmas Special\n:Due to the slowing economy, we could only afford to produce the prime-numbered panels.\n:You should be able to infer the missing parts of the story easily enough.\n:We apologize for the inconvenience.\n:[The first panel is blank.]\n:[Megan carrying Christmas lights and Cueball watching.]\n:Megan: I'm going to one-up those Christmas light displays on YouTube.\n:[Megan thinking.]\n:Megan: Hmm.
