The previous one was [[44: Love]], and the next one was [[22: Barrel - Part 3]].\n\n==Explanation==\nBeacons, often in the form of lighthouses, were built on coasts to give ships a point of reference where land was, so that they could find where they were going, and to know where they should avoid during a storm. In the comic, [[Megan]] fills this role for [[Cueball]]: she is his beacon to know where he can be safe. This also has a romantic notion, as Megan is lighting up the world for Cueball to find her.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A crowd of figures stand around in the dark. A Megan is illuminated by a beam of light.]\n:In a dark and confusing world,\n:you burn brightly \n:I never feel lost\n\n==Trivia==\nThis used to be one of the [[Footer comics|footer comics]] featured in the bottom segment of [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 22]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Footer comics]] <!-- in initial footer -->\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
