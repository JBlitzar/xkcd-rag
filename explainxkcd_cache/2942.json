[[Randall]] states that people often unconsciously shorten words in various ways when speaking to optimize the fluidity of speech. \nHe then presents four side-view diagrams of the human mouth and paths depicting how it might conceptually move (it depending a lot on how the individual normally forms even the major phonemes) when saying increasingly fluid versions of \"going to.\"\n\nThe first diagram gives the pronunciation /ɡoʊɪŋ tu/ ''GO-ing TO''. This is the version found in dictionaries and used when one is speaking slowly and deliberately. Here, the tongue and lips have to move a lot. The phrase starts at the back of the throat with a velar /g/ and moves into the diphthong OH /oʊ/ and the approximant /w/ to the KIT vowel /ɪ/. (Though it's not in the traditional IPA transcription or the comic, most native accents will insert a [w] between [ʊ] and another vowel.) The tongue then has to move right back to where it started for the \"ng\" in \"going\", the velar /ŋ/, followed by an even bigger jump forwards to the alveolar /t/ and back again for the back vowel /u/. Since /t/ is a voiceless consonant, the vocal cords will briefly stop vibrating, interrupting the sound, which the diagram illustrates as a gap in the path.\n\nThe second diagram shows a slightly more efficient pronunciation, in which the /ŋ/ is replaced by an /n/ instead since both /n/ and /t/ are alveolar sounds. The final /u/ weakens to the more neutrally positioned /ə/, which is the \"default\" vowel (aka you should be making this sound if you relax your mouth completely and give a small grunt). (For more about Schwa, see [[2907: Schwa]].) All doubling back of the tongue is now removed, leaving only a small, nearly closed loop.\n\nThe third diagram shows an even more efficient and very common pronunciation of the phrase, /ɡʌnə/ ''GUN-na''. Here rather than optimizing tongue movement hard-to-pronounce sounds are removed or further replaced instead. The /t/ is dropped leaving only /n/, while the vowel(s) of the first syllable go from /o/ to /ʌ/ between which the only difference is the optional rounding, or pursing, of the lips - though more likely given Randall Munroe's prior comics demonstrating a {{w|Phonological history of English close back vowels#STRUT–COMMA merger|ꜱᴛʀᴜᴛ-coᴍᴍᴀ merger}}, a supposed /ə/.\n\nThe fourth diagram shows the most reduced pronunciation. The /n/ is lost as a consonant in its own right, with only remnants of its existence found by the nasalisation of the preceding vowel where part of the airflow is redirected through the nose. (This is, incidentally, the same way that French got its famous nasal sounds - sequences of what used to be vowel + /n/ from Latin were reduced.) This way, the only motions one must make is to articulate the /ɡ/, which some would voice by a movement of the rear tongue although parts of the {{w|larynx}} may primarily be employed by others. This pronunciation seems almost unconnected to the original phrase of \"going to\". However, English speakers will still almost always understand this in context, and likely think they heard \"gonna\" \n\nIn some ways, this may also help explain how Neil Armstrong's line \"One small step for a man\" was heard over the radio as \"One small step for man\". As you move towards More Fluid, the phrase \"for a man\" can quickly become \"foreh-man\" and then \"fur-man\". While extensive research has been done elsewhere on this topic, when given the choice between a technical problem with the radio, and issues with phonetic pronunciation under pressure, the latter seems more likely.\n\nIn the bottom text, Randall comments on the perception of reduced pronunciations, remarking that while many perceive them as being sloppy, in reality deliberately pronouncing each word with the \"supposed\" pronunciation in its dictionary form sounds stilted, forced, and unnatural.  The final T in the word \"hot\" is an example of this. Most people when thinking of T think there is only one way to pronounce it - usually the aspirated unvoiced alveolar plosive \"tuh\" found at the start of syllables - but in reality it varies widely depending on position and accent, most noticeable if one pronounces a word such as \"teat\". In this context the \"t\" in \"hot\" is replaced by a {{w|glottal stop}}; funnily enough, and perhaps ironically, despite being the same sound it is never stigmatized, unlike intervocalic \"t\"s such as bottle which some speakers, particularly some British ones, also replace with glottal stops (rendered 'humorously' as <code>bo'oh</code>). It you speak English in the British \"standard\" Received Pronunciation form you may have to put on a fake American accent to understand this joke. It works best if you attempt an outrageous stereotype of a slurred non-English speaker. \n\nThe title text is a serious shout-out to linguist [[Gretchen McCulloch]] who has been teaching Randall about this stuff, but includes a joke about what happens when he tries these things out in public.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|A description of the path of the sound.}}\n\n:[Above the panel:]\n:Fun fact: Experienced speakers constantly merge, drop, and alter sounds when talking at normal conversational speed to optimize for efficient mouth movement.\n\n:[The panel shows four labeled side profiles of a mouth with paths of sounds made in different parts of the mouth.
