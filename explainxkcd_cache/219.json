Ponytail answers that Megan's childishness stems from a fear of growing up. \n\nMegan responds that she's fine with growing up. She sees her behavior as a mature realization that some of the things she enjoyed as a child are still enjoyable. When pressed for evidence that she has in any way become an \"adult,\" it is revealed that her boyfriend, presumably Cueball, is inside the blanket fort. He has not spoken because he fears to be found by them when \"not exactly dressed,\" thus implying that \"adult\" activities had been going on in the fort.\n\nThe title text provides another example of this: They built a fort in the woods, another type of fort that a kid would love to have, but then used it to hide a body. This implies that they killed someone, which is not usually associated with children.{{Citation needed}}  A hooker is also more formally known as a {{w|prostitute}}, which is also not usually associated with children.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Ponytail are talking with each other. There is a fort made of cushions and blankets on the left.]\n:Megan: Like my fort? It uses every blanket and cushion in the apartment.\n\n:Ponytail: Okay, no offense, but this is like that ball pit you made -- Cute, but don't you worry you're clinging to childhood games because you're afraid of change?\n\n:Megan: No. I'm happy to grow up. But I won't pretend fun things aren't still fun out of fear of looking silly.\n:Ponytail: But you're 24 and building blanket forts. How have you changed? What's adult about that?\n\n:Megan: Well, there's my boyfriend curled up in the back.\n:Ponytail: ...Ah.\n:Boyfriend [from inside the fort]: Excuse my shyness. I'm not exactly dressed.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
