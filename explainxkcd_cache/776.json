I mean, what does a SQUIRREL know about mental health?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nLack of sleep causes hallucinations different from insanity â€” insane people find it very difficult or impossible to distinguish between a hallucination and reality because the part of their brain that checks for normality in a situation is also broken. Level-1 sleep hallucinations do not make it through this \"sanity filter\" in a sane human being.\n\n[[Cueball]] has been sleep deprived for quite a while now, and he begins questioning his reality. He wonders if he is awake, or he is dreaming. He also wonders whether or not he is hallucinating a tree, then proceeding to question whether his hallucination might be a hallucination, and he might actually be sane. This double negative would '''not''' work mainly due to the fact that if you are hallucinating a hallucination, you are still hallucinating, and most likely you are not completely sane. In the end a squirrel comes up to him, and tells him not to worry about the possibility that he might be sane, thereby proving that [[Cueball]] is, at the very least, hallucinating.\n\nIn the title text, [[Cueball]] refuses to listen to the squirrel, not because its dialogue is a hallucination, but because a squirrel probably wouldn't know much about mental health in the first place. This is the final proof that [[Cueball]] is insane, because he cannot distinguish between a hallucination and reality (talking to a squirrel).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Woozy Cueball walks and speaks.]\n:Cueball: The sleep deprivation madness worsens.\n\n:[Cueball examines his hands.]\n:Cueball: Things seem unreal. Am I even awake? Maybe I'm dreaming.\n\n:[Cueball approaches a tree with a squirrel on it.]\n:Cueball: I'm pretty sure I'm hallucinating this tree.\n\n:[Cueball is now in front of the tree, and the squirrel is on the ground. Cueball has his arms open.]\n:Cueball: But what if I'm hallucinating that I'm hallucinating, and I'm actually totally sane?\n:Squirrel: Listen.\n:Squirrel: I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Squirrels]]"
