The comic is based on a chapter in the book. \n\nAs the comic celebrates the book, which was released on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2019, the comic was thus also released on a [[:Category:Tuesday comics|Tuesday]] to coincide with the release day, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release. This was the same timing used for another of Randall's book releases, when [[1608: Hoverboard]] came out on the Tuesday when [[Thing Explainer]] came out. Although the Hoverboard comic is much more complex than this one, they are both [[:Category:Dynamic comics|dynamic]] and [[:Category:Interactive comics|interactive]], and include [[:Category:Comics with animation|animations]]. Also, the [[Header text|header text]] changed to [[Header text#2019-09-04_-_Happy_Release_Day_-_bookstore|promote the release]] creating a large [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/08/2198_Throw_-_Front_page_promotion.PNG combined promotion] of the book during the three full days the comic was on the front page (see more [[2198:_Throw/Screen-shots#Entire_xkcd_page_with_promotion|here]]).\n\nIn this comic the viewer can select a thrower and an object to be thrown, see this [[#Throwers and throw items|table]], and get an [[2198:_Throw/Screen-shots#Animation|animation]] of how the selected throw would work out, along with an estimated distance of the throw (both in the SI unit meter (m) and in other very arbitrary units; see this [[#Table of distance units|table]] below) if the throw was possible. Impossible throws include those where the thrower is not strong enough to throw the object, or when the thrower tries to throw themselves, which is possible as four \"objects\" are also listed as throwers, most prominently {{w|George Washington}}. As the picture above cannot show all the possible selections in the two windows, pictures of all possible selections can be found [[2198:_Throw/Screen-shots#Throwers_and_Objects|here]]\n\nThe formula/guideline is apparently based on chapter 10 from the new ''How to'' book, see more under [[#Formulas|Formulas]]. \n\nIt seemed though, that there was a special case to the calculations with {{w|Thor|Thor's}} hammer ({{w|Mjolnir}}). Because this comic obviously refers to the {{w|Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor}} from the {{w|Marvel universe}}, played by another possible thrower, {{w|Chris Hemsworth}} in the {{w|Marvel Cinematic Universe}}, and {{w|Mjolnir (comics)|his hammer}}, which is enchanted such that only those deemed \"worthy\" are able to lift it. As such, despite its mass in principle being liftable by many of the characters, only Thor, God of Thunder (who is canonically worthy), is able to throw it. Thor is also the only one who uses {{w|furlongs}} to measure his distances among the standard throwers. However, it is not a canonical part of this comic that only he can throw it, and its mass is not realistic, see more below.\n\n[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f3/2198_Throw_-_Original_without_you.PNG Originally], when the comic was just released, there where only 7 throwers and 15 things to throw, giving a total of 105 different combinations; see the [[#Table of throw distances|table]] below. But only Thor can throw all 15, with three of the objects (George Washington, Thor's hammer, and the car) unthrowable by any of the other throwers. The smaller critters can throw only a few things, so the total number of throws is much less than 105. Still, there is an animation for all 105 combinations, but with no throw distance for many of these. \n\nBut already on day one the comic was out, a new thrower was added with the standard name \"You\", and this person, [[Knit Cap]], was also added to the objects that can be thrown increasing the number of throwers to 8 and objects to be thrown to 16. However, it would not be true to say that the number of options now would be 8 x 16 = 128, since the \"You\" can be customized when selecting it in the throwers menu (but not when selecting You in the object menu). When doing so a new window called [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/thumb/4/48/2198_Throw_-_Custom_thrower.PNG/835px-2198_Throw_-_Custom_thrower.PNG Custom thrower] will open up over the comic. The \"You\" option can then be customized by changing the name (from the default \"You\"), and defining the height (default 5.8 ft = 1.77 m) and weight (default 160 lb = 72.57 kg), where ft (feet) can be changed to m (meter) and lb (pound) can be changed to kg (kilograms). But when doing so the window will not correct the number from feet to meter etc. but stay the same. \n\nBelow the above options there is line with four persons above it, defining a scale of ''athleticism'', the default second option being the drawing of \"you\" which represents ''Decent'' form (i.e. a normal person).  The first on the scale is [[Black Hat]], who thinks moving things is for suckers, thus representing minimal athleticism. \"You\" in second position is in decent shape and pretty good form, representing decent athleticism. George Washington in third position represents extremely high athleticism, and as he states he threw so well they made him President. Finally the fourth position, representing a champion athlete, shows a person with a helmet with chin strap and goggles who states that he trains 36 hours a day by using a time machine. It is thus indicated that such athletes can only be so good by training more than is possible; for instance, if he travels 24 hours back every day, he could use 12 more of these to practice, making it 36 hours on that \"normal day\" and he would then still have 12 hours to eat and sleep/restitution before his next 36 hours training pass.\n\nChanging away from the decent \"You\" to one of the other three characters on the athleticism scale does not, however, change the character used for the animation, which stays the same. But still this gives a very large number of different \"yous\" to both throw and be thrown. \n\nA self-created character, unrealistically tall and heavy well over the human records for height ({{w|List of tallest people|272 cm}}) and/or weight ({{w|List of heaviest people|635 kg}}), can actually be able to [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e3/2198_Throw_-_You_throw_hammer_settings.PNG throw Thor's hammer] (For instance 4m and 1000 kg, see more [[2198:_Throw/Screen-shots#Hammer_throw|here]]. So it is not because it is magically inclined to only be thrown by Thor, it is just that the weight is set to 2000 kg, and only Thor of the standard characters have the strength (1000 times normal human strength) to throw such a heavy object. But if the \"You\" is big enough, the athletic difference with Thor will be compensated by sheer weight and height. See this table of [[2198:_Throw#Data_from_xkcd_code|data from the comic]] for the above numbers.\n\nInterestingly, Thor can throw a squirrel 257 meters.  If a Custom Thrower is created, and they are 200 meters tall and 150 KG, they can throw the squirrel 256 meters (1 meter less than Thor).  Thor can throw an acorn 136 meters, and the Custom Thrower will throw it 133 meters.  Now, Thor can throw Thor's Hammer 19 meters.  The Custom Thrower can throw it 44 meters!  Apparently there is more to the enchantment of Thor's Hammer than meets the eye, as it would have been expected that if Thor can throw a squirrel and an acorn farther than an extraordinary human, then certainly he could throw his own enchanted Hammer a longer distance. This is, of course, because the Custom Thrower now throws from much higher than Thor.  As to why the height doesn't affect the acorn or squirrel throwing distance in the same way it does Thor's Hammer, we'll leave that to you, the reader.\n\nThe title text refers to throwing a party (a colloquial synonym of hosting a party) and first makes the assumption of actually giving hints for giving a party, and then switches to suggest a mechanism to literally throw a huge object, such as a house with a party going on inside. An {{w|Aircraft_catapult#Steam_catapult|aircraft steam catapult}} is a mechanism to launch aircraft from ships, typically used on aircraft carriers.\n\n==Safety Considerations==\nMany of the items, even if technically possible to throw, may not be able to be thrown safely.  \n\nFor example:\n* Depending on how the microwave oven is damaged when it hits the ground, it may still be able to appear to function, but no longer seal properly, and therefore leak dangerously high amounts of microwave radiation.\n* Blenders have blades and glass.  Even if no one is struck by the flying blender, the broken pieces would be hazardous later if they are not properly disposed of.\n* Cars have gasoline and battery acid which may spill if one is thrown.\n* A squirrel might bite the person attempting to throw it, which is dangerous as some squirrels have rabies.\n* Pikachu could shock (possibly fatally) someone trying to throw it.\n* If a {{w|Dwarf-tossing|person is thrown}}, that person may be badly injured. If you throw people without consent they might punch you{{Citation needed}}.\n\n==Throwers and throw items==\n*Here is a table with first the throwers and then the objects to be thrown.\n**George Washington, Pikachu, and the squirrel are both throwers and throwable objects, as are the costumed option \"You\".\n**For these four this is noted in the explanation. The \"You\" is also the first object, Washington and Pikachu is no. 11-12 and the Squirrel is also the last object (no. 16) in the object list. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |\n! Image\n! Name\n!

The viewer may also choose to create a custom thrower, for instance, themself, inputting a name, height, weight, and general level of athleticism, as measured on a scale from \"[[Black Hat]]\" to \"championship athlete\" (a swimmer is pictured). The custom thrower is also selectable as a throwing item, presumably to provide more variety compared to the fixed values of George Washington.\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - george.png]]\n|'''{{w|George Washington}}''' \n|'''Can also be thrown'''. The first president of the United States of America. There is a myth that a young George Washington threw a silver dollar across the {{w|Potomac River}} (\"myth\" being the operative word here &mdash; many sections of the Potomac are more than a mile wide, and the United States did not mint its own silver dollars until 1794, very late into Washington's life). He is also used as a throwing item to represent the likelihood of a thrower distance with an average human as the projectile. George Washington is shown as a very powerful thrower; the comic makes fun of the flagrant embellishment of Washington's life.\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - quarterback.png]]\n|'''An NFL {{w|quarterback}}'''\n|A quarterback in the National Football League is a highly athletic individual.  Gridiron football is a full-contact sport that requires durability, speed, and precision. One of the primary skills required of quarterbacks is to be able to throw the football far with precise accuracy.\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - pikachu.png]]\n|'''{{w|Pikachu}}''' \n|'''Can also be thrown'''. Pikachu is a species of Pokémon and the mascot of the Pokémon franchise as a whole. Although Pikachu are not normally shown to throw things, the ''Super Smash Bros'' series shows they are perfectly capable of picking things up that do not significantly out-size them. That said, Pikachu is capable of throwing a wide variety of objects through the move Fling, which allows the user to deal damage by throwing its held item (and, incidentally, a Fling TM). Its presence as a throwing item appears to reference the most recently released Pokémon games as of the comic's release, ''Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu'' and ''Pokémon Let's Go Eevee'', where the partner Pokémon of the respective title is not kept in a Poké Ball but thrown into battle when deployed. <br>According to Pokédex entries throughout the series, the average Pikachu is 1'04\" (0.4m) tall and weighs 13.2 lbs (6kg). Randall appears to have done his research, as a custom thrower with these stats and default athleticism will have near-identical results to Pikachu for both thrower and thrown item.\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - carly.png]]\n|'''{{w|Carly Rae Jepsen}}'''\n|A Canadian music artist with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgwAywJlo1M marginal throwing ability.]\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - thor.png]]\n|'''{{w|Thor}}'''\n|Thor is the god of thunder in Norse mythology, wielding a hammer that returns to its wielder when thrown.

It is based on {{w|Mjölnir}} the hammer of Norse God {{w|Thor}}, God of Thunder.  In this comic, though, it appears that Mjolnir is just incredibly heavy, and Thor is able to throw it because he is very strong.  The custom thrower is also able to throw it if their size and strength are set high enough.  Setting aside this customization, Thor is the only standard thrower to be able to throw Thor's hammer.  In the movies based on the Marvel universe, Thor is played by Chris Hemsworth, who is also one of the throwers, but in real life, he would of course not be able to throw such a weighty hammer.\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - javelin.png]]\n|'''A {{w|javelin}}'''\n|An aerodynamic item like a spear thrown in Olympic sport.\n|-\n|[[File:2198 Throw - silver_spin.png]]\n|'''A {{w|Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar}} spinning'''\n|A silver coin representing one (1) US dollar in value, as would have been common when George Washington was president.

Mr. Smoot was used to measure the length of the Harvard Bridge (connecting Boston and Cambridge) by being repeatedly laid down along the length of the bridge; the markings indicating distances in smoots along the bridge have been maintained by the fraternity. This measurement is used for lengths from 16 to 36 meters. While the smoot is a nonstandard unit of length, Oliver Smoot has been chairman of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and President of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  ANSI and ISO are among the world's main standardizing bodies, so Randall may indirectly be making the pun that while Smoot's body isn't a standard measure, Smoot has been in charge of bodies that standardize measurements.\n|-\n|{{w|List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement#Horse|Horses}} \n|2.4\n|The length of a {{w|horse}} varies a lot with the horse type, breed, age, and genes. In the Wikipedia article on horses, the length of a horse is not even mentioned, only the height and weight. But Randall has used horses for measurements before. A {{w|horse length}} is approximately 8 feet (2.4 m). This measurement is used for lengths from 36 to 75 meters.\n|-\n|{{w|List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement#Block|Manhattan blocks}}\n|80.0\n|Most of {{w|Manhattan}} is a main {{w|street grid}} (the southernmost ~2 miles (3.2 km) isn't (no 1811 plan yet), the next ~8.25 miles is (including the bigger of two main central business districts), the remaining ~2.8 miles of island street system is less and less like the famous part the further north you go (steep hills and pro- and anti-grid people fighting). Between 1st Street and 164th or 165th {{w|city block|blocks}} are roughly 200 feet (79 m) wide net of streets and sidewalks (which sum to 60 feet (18 m) except 155th, 145th, 135th, 125th, 116th, 106th, 96th, 86th, 79th, 72nd, 57th, 42nd, 34th, 23rd, and 14th Streets are 100 feet (30 m) and {{w|Houston Street|the street below 1st}} is 125 feet (38 m) which is almost the perfect width to give the row of blocks below 1st a maximum width of 280 feet (85 m) street centerline-to-centerline which is what it would be if 0th Street existed and was 100 feet wide and the grid continued to its south side). Thus there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile (the 100 foot streets aren't exactly once per 10 streets cause Broadway etc) and I measured 43,560.01 feet from the lowest street centerline point of the row of blocks below 1st to what the centerline of the grid-compliant part of 165th Street would be if it was 100 feet wide instead of 80 (this is closer to what it should be (43,560 feet) than my method's error bar size). {{w|Manhattan distance}} is a {{w|taxicab geometry}} concept (the shortest distance if you must travel parallel to or on Cartesian axes). This measurement is used for lengths from 75 to 131 meters.\n|-\n|{{w|List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement#Football_field_(length)|Football fields}}\n|91.44/109.728\n|A football field in the comic is 100 yards or 91.44 m long. An {{w|American football field}} is 100 yards between the end zone although by including those it is actually 120 yards or 109.728 m. Although it is an American comic, it doesn't state that it is an American Football field. A {{w|Football pitch}} in {{w|Association football}} (Soccer) is also often used, and although the length of those varies the usual size for champions league matches is 105 m. This measurement is used for lengths from 131 to 201 meters.\n|-\n|{{w|Furlongs}}\n|201.168\n|A furlong is a measure of distance in imperial units and U.S. customary units equal to one-eighth of a mile. It is part of the {{w|List_of_humorous_units_of_measurement#FFF_units|FFF_units}} of the {{w|FFF system}} for furlong/firkin/fortnight, length, mass and time. One furlong should therefore be 201.168 meters, though the United States does not uniformly use this conversion ratio. Older ratios are in use for surveying purposes in some states. Only Thor's distances are given in furlongs. This measurement is used for lengths of 201 meters (1 furlong) and up. For the standard throwers and items only Thor can throw over 200 m, thus only he uses Furlongs to measure his throws. Given that this is an old unit, and Thor is based on ancient Nordic Mythology, this may seem appropriate. \n|}\n\n===Data from xkcd code===\n*A user got this data from the code (and added it to the comments).\n**But it makes sense to include here:\n*From this it can be seen that:\n**Thor's Hammer is not special, just very heavy, 2000 kg despite being rather small.\n**Thor has the same stats as Chris, except he has 1000 times more Throw power (10,000 vs 10).\n*The customizable You can have Throw power of 5, 10, 15 and 20, and weight and height can be set along with the name. \n**The diameter is calculated from the formula given, so in the standard setting it is about 0.5 m.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! id\n! name\n! canThrow\n! canBeThrown\n! length (m)\n! diameter (m)\n! mass (kg)\n! dragC\n! throwPower\n|-\n| microwave\n| A microwave oven\n| false\n| true\n| 0.406\n| 0.406\n| 10.591\n| 0.8\n| \n|-\n| basketball\n| a basketball\n| false\n| true\n| 0.243\n| 0.243\n| 0.624\n| 0.3\n| \n|-\n| blender\n| a blender\n| false\n| true\n| 0.203\n| 0.203\n| 5.216\n| 0.8\n| \n|-\n| gold_bar\n| a gold bar\n| false\n| true\n| 0.0535\n| 0.0535\n| 12.4\n| 0.8\n| \n|-\n| cake\n| a wedding cake\n| false\n| true\n| 0.51\n| 0.51\n| 13\n| 0.8\n| \n|-\n| pingpong\n| a ping pong ball\n| false\n| true\n| 0.04\n| 0.04\n| 0.003\n| 0.5\n| \n|-\n| quarterback\n| an NFL quarterback\n| true\n| false\n| 1.905\n| 0.584\n| 102.058\n| 0.6\n| 20\n|-\n| acorn\n| an acorn\n| false\n| true\n| 0.0191\n| 0.0191\n| 0.0045\n| 0.3\n| \n|-\n| hammer\n| thor's hammer\n| false\n| true\n| 0.5\n| 0.15\n| 2000\n| 0.4\n| \n|-\n| javelin\n| a javelin\n| false\n| true\n| 1.8\n| 0.0254\n| 0.8\n| 0.1\n| \n|-\n| george\n| George Washington\n| true\n| true\n| 1.829\n| 0.562\n| 90.718\n| 0.6\n| 15\n|-\n| pikachu\n| Pikachu\n| true\n| true\n| 0.4\n| 0.3\n| 5.9874\n| 0.4\n| 10\n|-\n| car\n| A car\n| false\n| true\n| 4.5\n| 2.134\n| 1179.34\n| 0.25\n| \n|-\n| silver_spin\n| a silver dollar (spinning)\n| false\n| true\n| 0.04\n| 0.011\n| 0.027\n| 0.5\n| \n|-\n| silver_tumble\n| a silver dollar (tumbling)\n| false\n| true\n| 0.04\n| 0.04\n| 0.027\n| 0.66\n| \n|-\n| carly\n| Carly Rae Jepsen\n| true\n| false\n| 1.575\n| 0.46\n| 49.895\n| 0.6\n| 10\n|-\n| thor\n| thor, god of thunder\n| true\n| false\n| 1.91\n| 0.59\n| 91\n| 0.6\n| 10000\n|-\n| chris hemsworth\n| chris hemsworth\n| true\n| false\n| 1.91\n| 0.59\n| 91\n| 0.6\n| 10\n|-\n| squirrel\n| A squirrel\n| true\n| true\n| 0.203\n| 0.096\n| 0.454\n| 0.6\n| 10\n|-\n| you (can change)\n| You \n| true \n| true \n| 1.77\n| (mass^(1/3))/8\n| 72.5\n| 0.6\n| 10\n|}\n\n===Formulas===\n<math>\\begin{array}{lcl}\ng&=&9.805 \\frac{\\mathrm m}{{\\mathrm s}^2} = 9.805 \\frac{\\mathrm N}{\\mathrm{kg}}\\\\\nA&=&\\sqrt[3]{\\frac {3 * \\mathrm{thrower\\_length} * \\mathrm{thrower\\_throwPower} * \\mathrm{thrower\\_mass}} {\\mathrm{object\\_mass} + \\mathrm{thrower\\_mass} / 1000}}\\\\\nB&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{2 * \\mathrm{object\\_mass} * g}{\\pi * {(\\mathrm{object\\_diameter} / 2)}^2 * 1.2041 \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{{\\mathrm m}^3} * \\mathrm{object\\_dragC}}}\\\\\n\\mathrm{distance}&=&\\frac{A^2 * \\sqrt2} {g * \\sqrt{\\frac{A^4} { B^4} * 0.8 + \\frac{A^2} {B^2} * 3 + 2}}\n\\end{array} </math>\n\nConstants and Units:\n* g is the gravitational acceleration (on earth)\n* 1.2041 kg/m³ is the density of air at sea level\n* A (in m/s) is the calculated throw speed regardless of direction, if you assume constant throw power over time in Watts and the body length as acceleration distance (arm has half the body length and goes from back to front) from 0 m/s to the final speed \n* B is the possible throw speed, which still does not air brake the object too much.
