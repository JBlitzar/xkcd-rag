The previous one was [[30: Donner]], and the next one was [[29: Hitler]].\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:flowers_inverted.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|An inverted and monochrome version of the comic, created to mimic the original drawing.]]\nThis is a drawing of flowers made by [[Randall Munroe|Randall]]. According to the title text and the original caption on the LiveJournal post, he originally drew the flowers with a pencil on a white sheet of paper. Then, he used the invert feature of a photo-editing program to reverse it from black-on-white to white-on-black and colored to the flowers. The image below gives a good approximation of what the original drawing might have looked like. He also says the flowers are based on his imagination and are probably not a real species.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A sketch of flowers, drawn in green, red, and yellow on a black background.]\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 30]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]"
