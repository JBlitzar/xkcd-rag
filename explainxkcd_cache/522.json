Excerpt: Lincoln lay back on the bed, nude save for his trademark stovepipe hat. 'Tell me,' he purred seductively, as he and Obama formed a more perfect union. 'When you come, is it 10% ethanol?'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\n{{w|Google Search|Google}} keeps track of which searches are most popular in which regions as part of more general data mining to improve their service. For the enjoyment/education of others, they release select, non-personal parts of this data under the banner \"[http://www.google.com/trends/ Google Trends].\"\n\nThe first statistic – that \"Men kissing\" was popular in {{w|Utah}}, a state known for possessing a large population with very conservative social values, including opposition to homosexuality – is real.{{acn}} The others are made up for the sake of the joke. In order:\n\n; Installing Ubuntu\" – Redmond, WA\n: {{w|Ubuntu}} is a {{w|Linux}} distribution; {{w|Redmond, Washington}} is home to {{w|Microsoft}}, the company that makes the rival operating system {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}}.\n; Running for President in 2010\" – Wasilla, AK\n: 2010 was not a presidential election year in the United States; {{w|Wasilla, Alaska}} is home to {{w|Sarah Palin}}, a politician known for making such gaffes and who was {{w|John McCain}}'s {{w|running mate}} in the {{w|United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election}} that occurred a few weeks before this comic.\n; Lincoln Fan Fiction\" – Chicago, IL\n: {{w|Abraham Lincoln}} was the US president from 1861 to his assassination in 1865; {{w|Chicago, Illinois}} is home to {{w|Barack Obama}}, who apparently reads (presumably {{w|erotic}}) {{w|fanfiction}} about the former president.\n; Raptors on Hoverboards\" – Somerville, MA\n: {{w|Velociraptors}} are a favorite xkcd topic; there are also frequent references to ''{{w|Back to the Future}}'' as with the {{w|hoverboards}} here. {{w|Somerville, Massachusetts}} is home to [[Randall Munroe]]. The speed of a ''Raptor on Hoverboard'' is given in [[526: Converting to Metric]].\n; How is babby formed\" – Wasilla, AK\n: \"How is babby formed?\" was the title (and most of the content) of an infamous Yahoo! Answers question (see the title text of [[481: Listen to Yourself]] and [[550: Density]]). Wasilla, Alaska is, again, home to {{w|Sarah Palin}}; a few months prior to this comic's release, Sarah Palin revealed that her daughter, {{w|Bristol Palin}}, was pregnant out of wedlock. Ironically, before her pregnancy, Bristol Palin advocated sexual abstinence before marriage as pointed out in this [https://time.com/archive/6914503/in-defense-of-bristol-palin-abstinence-spokeswoman/ Time article], as well as banning sex education in schools.{{Actual citation needed}} Ignorance of common contraceptives like condoms can cause unplanned pregnancies to happen. Additionally, Sarah Palin has been a consistent opponent of {{w|Political Positions of Sarah Palin#Abortion|abortion}}; this search may imply that Palin is making policy bout pregnancy while lacking a basic scientific understanding of how pregnancy works.\n; I hate this website\" – Mountain View, CA\n: {{w|Mountain View, California}} is home to {{w|Google}}'s headquarters. The implication is that Google employees are putting \"I hate this website\" into Google.\n\nWith regards to the excerpt Randall provides in the title text:\n*{{w|Slash fiction}} is a genre of fan fiction that focuses on homosexual behavior.\n*Lincoln/Obama (pronounced Lincoln slash Obama) fan fiction normally should be between Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama.\n*The \"more perfect union\" line comes from the preamble to the US Constitution: \"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union...\". However, it seems to have a sexual connotation in this case.\n*{{w|orgasm|Come}} (sometimes spelled cum) might be a reference to Obama orgasming and/or ejaculating.\n*{{w|Ethanol}} is the more scientific name for drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol. \n*\"{{w|Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E10_or_less|10% ethanol}}\" refers to automotive gasoline that includes 10% ethanol (usually made from corn or other vegetables), with the hopes of reducing the dependence on oil for fuel. The Obama administration [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/15/obama-lower-quotas-ethanol-gasoline adopted a policy in 2013] that mandated ethanol to make up 10% of the US’s fuel supply.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Bloggers were recently amused to discover that,\n:according to Google Trends, the search term:\n:\"men kissing\" is most popular in conservative Utah.\n:A few other embarrassing correlations:\n\n:[A two-column table]\n:[On the left side of the table:]\n:;<u>Search Term</u>\n\n:;Installing Ubuntu\n\n:;Running for President in 2010\n\n:;Lincoln Fan Fiction\n\n:;Raptors on Hoverboards\n\n:;How is babby formed?\n\n:;I hate this website\n\n:[On the right side of the table:]\n:;<u>Top City</u>\n\n:;Redmond, WA\n\n:;Wasilla, AK\n\n:;Chicago, IL\n\n:;Somerville, MA\n\n:;Wasilla, AK\n\n:;Mountain View, CA\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:Velociraptors]]\n[[Category:Google Search]]\n[[Category:Homosexuality]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
