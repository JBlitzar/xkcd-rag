It says that if this is not the case, if she (or he) doesn't want to go naked after receiving this card, then it is not really meant (i.e. their heart is not in it). \n\nThe title text implies that this is being offered as a Valentine that someone might give and then \"pretend\" that they were kidding. Which seems to imply that they would not, in fact, be kidding, that this represents their real feelings. \n\nA funny thing is also that the text on the card implies that if the card indeed does get the receiver naked, that the action of giving it was truly meant. In that case, the giver would always deny that it was not meant and claim they are truly in love. Of course this cannot be true, since getting laid was the main motivation of appreciating the 'loved' one. \"In it\" could be an intentional sexual innuendo.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Valentine's Day heart bordered with wavy red lace-like pattern with text:]\n<center>I want to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wish you a\n\n'''''<span style=\"font-size: larger\">Happy Valentine's Day</span>'''''\n\nbut unless this card is going\n\nto finally get you naked,\n\nI have to admit\n\nmy heart's\n\nnot really \n\nin it.</center>\n\n==Trivia==\nSimilar to [[62: Valentine - Karnaugh]], until 2023-09-23 or before, the image for this comic was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise due to the EXIF metadata.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Valentines]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
