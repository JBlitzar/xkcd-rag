It came about 15 months after the fifth [[2613: Bad Map Projection: Madagascator]] (#248), and was followed 11 months later by [[2951: Bad Map Projection: Exterior Kansas]] (#45).\n\nIn this map, [[Randall]] has plotted the world map featuring all the landmasses from both western and eastern hemispheres. But the longitudes west of the prime meridian, normally given negative values from 0° to -180°, have been made positive using the \"ABS()\" function that gives the {{w|absolute value}} by effectively stripping off the minus sign from any value. This results in the features on one side of the world being overlaid upon those of the other side, but mirrored. A similar concept was explored earlier in [[1500: Upside-Down Map]]. The caption \"Whoops, made all longitudes positive\" is similar to the caption in [[2256: Bad Map Projection: South America]] (\"Oops, all South Americas!\"). That was a reference to the cereal [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oops-all-berries-box-parodies ''Oops! All Berries''].\n\nThanks to the relative sparsity of western continents (most prominently the Americas, but also roughly half of Antarctica, the westernmost parts of Europe and Africa, the easternmost part of Siberia, and multiple Pacific islands), and the landless expanses of the Pacific, this is surprisingly not too dissimilar to an east-only fragment of a world map. Just with the reversed 'new world' lands added to the usual extents of continents of Africa and Eurasia and the somewhat familiar notable Antarctic Peninsula being recognizable but in an odd position (and reversed) with no sign of the {{w|Ross Sea|Ross}} and {{w|Weddel Sea}}s (as eastern-Antarctic landmass takes precedence). Most continents can be traced out, but North America overlaps so much with Asia that most of its outlines are hidden.\n\nSome features of the real world disappear, such as the English Channel, the North American Great Lakes, and the Strait of Gibraltar. The Arabian Sea becomes a lake as South America cuts it off from the rest of the Indian Ocean (Indian-Pacific Ocean?). To further interest the [[977: Map Projections|map-connoisseur]], various locations are marked and dotted upon their genuine or reflected positions, putting into close proximity various locations that have (mainly) trans-Atlantic separation in reality. Some of these locations have been renamed in this projection by combining the names of newly overlapping locations. These are:\n*The \"Palk-Panama Canal\", combining the {{W|Palk Strait}} between India and Sri Lanka with the Panama Canal in Central America.\n*The \"Congo-Amazon Rainforest\", combining the world's two largest tropical rainforests, the {{w|Congo Rainforest|Congo}} in Africa and the {{w|Amazon Rainforest|Amazon}} in South America.\n*The \"Hudson Plain\", combining {{w|Hudson Bay}} in North America with the {{w|West Siberian Plain}}.\n*The \"Kara-Baffin Sea\", combining the {{w|Kara Sea}} to the north of Russia with {{w|Baffin Bay}} between Canada and Greenland.\n\nAdditionally in northern Siberia is the label \"Franklin's ''very'' lost expedition\". {{w|Franklin's lost expedition}} was an attempt to find a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic passage. Naturally, a sea voyage ending up in the middle of a large landmass would be considered very lost.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe title text references titles found in relaxing music videos called \"positive vibes only\", attempting to make the listener feel more positive and relaxed. Here, Randall adds his map projection, making it \"positive vibes/longitudes only\".\n\n===Correct formula===\nPossible correct formulae to get only positive longitudes of 0°<LONGITUDE≤360°, especially from the typical map range of -180°≤LONGITUDE≤+180°, are:\n\n:LONGITUDE=LONGITUDE+360*FLOOR(1-LONGITUDE/360)\n\n:LONGITUDE=360-(360-LONGITUDE) MOD 360;\n\nThese may assist in creating a world map centered on the Pacific, not too dissimilar to the one portrayed in [[503: Terminology]], which might be the conceit behind this comic's 'error'.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Do NOT delete this tag too soon.}}\n\n:[There is a map of the world with positive longitudes and negative longitudes overlapping. Caption above the map:]\n\n:Bad Map Projection #152:\n:Longitude=ABS(Longitude)\n:Whoops, made all longitudes positive\n\n:[The land masses are represented in white, and the oceans in light grey. Some capital cities, countries and geographical features are labeled.]\n\n:[Near Siberia, among the other city names, is indicated:]\n:Franklin's ''very'' lost expedition\n\n==Trivia==\nThe map has a few spelling errors, such as Reykjavík being misspelled as \"Reykjav'''i'''c\", and the Aleutian Islands being misspelled as \"A'''elu'''tian Islands\".\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Bad_Map_Projections]]"
