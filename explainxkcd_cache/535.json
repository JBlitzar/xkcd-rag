[awkward pause] '... faithfully.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] (or [[Randall]]) is musing about the possibility of being a woman, to the confusion of the man next to him. His uninsightful rambling would likely be unimpressive and somewhat odd in most situations, but not odd enough on its own to prompt the second man's baffled reaction. However, the true reason for his confusion is revealed by the caption: Cueball is administering the {{w|Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath}}. The oath is administered by reciting it to prompt a new president to repeat it back to them. However, he botches it completely by forgetting about his task and wondering aloud about an unrelated topic. Thus, the president's confused question at the beginning is not him asking for clarification; he is repeating what he at first believed to be the oath of office, but got flustered when he realized Cueball had deviated from the script. When Cueball then continues by replying that \"the menstruation thing is freaky,\" the president is completely derailed.\n\nOn January 20, 2009 the inauguration of {{w|Barack Obama}}'s first office took place. Chief Justice {{w|John Roberts}}, who was administering the oath, {{w|Oath of office of the President of the United States#Mishaps|made a mistake}} while reciting the words. This comic references the event and wildly exaggerates the deviation from the oath for comedic purposes.\n\nIn truth, the error was rather small: the oath as prescribed in the constitution is:\n:I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nDue to a missed memo on the pauses planned by the Chief Justice, Obama inadvertently interrupted Roberts during the first phrase - Roberts begins by saying I, Barack Obama, do solemnly swear, and Obama repeats his name while Roberts finishes that sentence. This disturbs Roberts who was not using notes, and he rendered the next phrase as \"that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully,\" misplacing the word ''faithfully'' and saying ''president to'' instead of ''president of''. Obama repeated, \"that I will execute\", then paused. Roberts attempted to correct the wording, but stumbled: \"the off— faithfully the pres— the office of President of the United States.\" Obama then repeated Roberts' initial incorrect wording.\n\nHowever small the error was it was big enough that Obama did {{w|Oath of office of the President of the United States#Oath mishaps|retake the oath of office}} the day after the mistake was made.\n\nThe title text continues the wondering about being a woman going on from the {{w|menstruation}} to the {{w|ovaries}}. To make sure it is clearly the oath mistake that is referenced the sentence ends with '... faithfully.' Thus mimicking the real mistake of placing this word last.\n\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is administering the presidential oath with the coming president also drawn as Cueball.]\n:Cueball: You know, it might be cool to be a woman.\n:President: It... might be cool to be a woman?\n:Cueball: Yeah, but the menstruation thing is freaky.\n:President: Yeah, but... the... um.
