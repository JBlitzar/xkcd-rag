A foot is a measure in poetry; it consists of stressed beats and unstressed beats. A trochee is a foot that consists of one stressed beat followed by an unstressed beat. \"Trochee\" itself is an example of this as you stress the first syllable and don't stress the second syllable (\"TROH-kee\".) \n\nTrochee fixation is supposedly caused by people experiencing rushes of {{w|dopamine}} when they hear or speak trochees during their youth. Due to the rush of dopamine, they become more fixated on trochees. In the endless quest for dopamine, they continue to search for trochees (typically on the internet) while also producing more places to encounter trochees meaning more fixation for others with the disorder. [[Megan]] proposes a \"radical trocheeotomy\" which appears to be a type of {{w|psychosurgery}} due to the erasing of memory. [[Cueball]] misinterprets Megan's intent as a \"{{w|tracheotomy}}\", which he mistakenly believes to be a removal of [[Jill]]'s vocal cords, of which he is in favor.\n\nMegan proceeds with the trocheeotomy, but luckily it does not have the intended effect. Though the previous trochees have been forcefully and unkindly removed, Jill immediately generates new ones: \"BAN-jo,\" \"TUR-tle,\" \"JET-pack,\" \"FER-ret,\" and so on. The correct way of removing the fixation would be to alter {{w|mesolimbic pathway}}. Megan, not realizing this, succumbs to attempting to removing her trochee fixation via cranially applied brick. Depending on how hard Jill is hit with the brick she may have memory loss and potentially forget all the trochees she knows, but if this method is carried out, she will have significant brain damage and will likely start fixating on trochees that she hears.\n\nThere are references to {{w|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}} and {{w|Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers}}, both of which are examples of actual, trochaic TV show titles. Additionally, there is a reference to sci/fi author {{w|Neal Stephenson}} who has written {{w|Snow Crash}}, which features this kind of programming as a major plot point, and many other books.\n\n\"Jetpack ferret\" could be a reference to [[20: Ferret]], although the ferret in question only had wings.\n\n{{w|Huffman coding}} is a lossless data compression algorithm that works by organizing characters into a tree structure (called a Huffman tree) with the most used characters in a string closer to the top. The characters in the string are then replaced by the sequence of bits representing their place in the tree, allowing for characters that are used very often to be represented with only a handful of bits compared to the 16 or 32 bits usually needed (depending on the character set used). In highly repetitive data this can cut down the file size immensely, which is what Randall is implying by saying you would only end up with 30–40 bytes. Most of the \"[[221: Random Number|random]]\" stuff said on the Internet has been said before, and isn’t particularly random either, following predictable patterns.\n\nTrochee and other types of poetry \"feet\" is the subject of [[1383: Magic Words]], and the trochaic form is explored further in [[1412: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].\n\n[http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/02/04/trochee-chart/ On the blag], Randall published statistics about the occurrence number of certain combinations (now obviously inaccurate).\n\n==Transcript==\n:Jill: Robot ninja!
