Using your work, I have proven that this equals the amount you requested.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Donald Knuth]] is a {{w|computer scientist}} who has written several computer science textbooks and he offers {{w|Knuth reward check|monetary rewards}} for anyone finding errors in his publications. The first error found in each book is worth US$2.56 (256=2<sup>8</sup> is a very important number in the IT domain). Other suggestions are worth less than $2.56, but a check is still sent out if Dr. Knuth finds them to be reasonable.\n\n[[Megan]] uses a proof to invalidate logic itself. (Of course, this means that her proof paradoxically renders itself meaningless. If logic has been disproven, her proof has no value.) According to the logic symbols \"∴ ''P'' ∧ ''<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">P</span>''\" at the bottom of the proof, she has proved that \"the proposition (statement) is true and the proposition is false,\" i.e. \"something is both true and false.\" (Specifically, ∴ means \"therefore\", presenting the outcome of the preceding proof. ''P'' represents that a proposition is true, ∧ stands for \"and\", and an overbar negates a proposition such that ''<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">P</span>'' represents that the (same) proposition is false. The negate symbol, ¬, is also used for this purpose, when placed in front of a symbol<!--letter? symbol?-->, so that \"''P'' ∧ ¬''P''\" is another form of this statement.) If someone were to prove this, it would indeed derail the very foundation of logic and result in the {{w|principle of explosion}}, which was referenced in [[704: Principle of Explosion|a previous comic]].\n\nSince most of the content of computer science textbooks is fundamentally based on logic, Megan's proof obviously spells doom for Dr. Knuth's, as each instance of logic can now be considered an error. After Megan's friend confirms the validity of her proof, Megan writes a letter to Dr. Knuth to collect her money for the 1,317,408 errors in {{w|The Art of Computer Programming}} at $2.56 each. According to the amount Megan demands as a reward, she apparently considers this textbook to have an average of more than 400 instances of logic per page (if she has the latest edition of each volume).\n\nThe title text is the reply from Dr. Knuth, in which he uses Megan's logic-disproving proof against her by claiming — with no logical explanation — that the amount of money she is in fact due as a reward is only 98 cents. In logic, from a contradiction (such as \"''P'' ∧ ''<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">P</span>''\") can be inferred any statement, including that $3,372,564.48 = $0.98. He does this presumably to a) get out of paying her over three million dollars, b) demonstrate his contempt for or disbelief in her proof, and/or c) to show her, rather passive-aggressively, that she herself is not exempt from any ill effects resulting from her proof.  If logic is proved to be false, then all mathematics are proved false and 3,372,564.48 = 0.98. Dr. Knuth could have also given her nothing, as 0 would equal 0.98 which would equal 3,372,564.48.\n\nThe title of the comic, \"Applied Math,\" is potentially a multi-meaning pun. {{w|Applied mathematics}}, as a field, refers to \"mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry,\" as opposed to {{w|pure mathematics}} which focuses on abstract concepts. Megan has applied (apparently 'pure') mathematics to a more materialistic real-world aim. That aim being to ''apply for'' a huge reward via this proof of dubious<!-- odd word, in context; presumably not so, 'in-universe', if Ponytail is sufficient authority; this particular phrase may need revisiting/clarifying --> validity.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail, standing at a whiteboard containing illegible text and arrows, is considering a logical proof with a hand on her chin. The proof assumes ''P'' and deduces ''P'' ∧ ''<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">P</span>'', which is written on the bottom of the whiteboard.]\n:Ponytail: Wow. I can't find fault with your proof.\n\n:[Ponytail is still looking at the white board, the frame expands to show Megan walking away, rubbing her hands together.]\n:Ponytail: You've shown the inconsistency — and thus the invalidity — of basic logic itself.\n:Megan: Excellent. On to step two...\n\n:[Megan sits down at a desk and begins to write.]\n:Written text: Dear Dr. Knuth,\n\n:[She continues to write.]\n:Written text: I am writing to collect from you the $3,372,564.48 I am owed for discovering 1,317,408 errors in ''The Art of Computer Programming...''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Donald Knuth]]\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
