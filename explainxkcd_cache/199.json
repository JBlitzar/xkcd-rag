Edwin Abbot Abbott has nothing on \"Girls on Girls in Tightly Closed Nonorientable Spaces\"\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe {{w|right-hand rule}} is a mathematics and physics trick to learning how to find the {{w|cross product}} of two Cartesian vectors in three dimensions. First, extend the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the first vector (in the example diagram in the comic, this is to the left). Then, curl your fingers in the direction of the second vector (out of the page/screen, in the example). Now point your thumb perpendicular to the other fingers, and it will point in the direction of the cross product of those two vectors (upwards, in the example). Note that reversing the order of the two vectors also reverses the direction of the cross product.\n\n*The book rule is an actual alternative to the right hand rule that might be useful to some physics students doing exercises out of their textbooks. However, it would give incorrect results with books in languages that are read from right to left, such as most Jewish prayer books, Japanese manga, etc.\n\n*The gun rule also technically works, but it would be extremely impractical, expensive, and dangerous to use and fire a loaded gun every time you want to find the result vector. It would also be very awkward to hold the gun in line with the vectors.  It also assumes that the safety latch is consistently on the same side of all guns; if a gun was made with the safety latch on the other side, then it would give incorrect results.\n\n*The body rule is described as for 'males only', which would limit the number of people who are able to use this rule. With the right arm oriented along one vector and the legs along the second, the result vector is found along the penis of a person who has one, which may be conveniently erected by watching porn. \n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Edwin Abbott Abbott}}, author of the book Flatland, a story about a two-dimensional world. Flatland is a recurring topic, such as in [[721: Flatland]]. The title text misspells Abbott's name - unlike most typos in XKCD, this has not been corrected by Randall. {{w|Orientability}} is a property that refers to a space with continuously varying {{w|surface normal}}s, which are essentially just vectors that are perpendicular to the surface of the space. Nearly every space commonly encountered is orientable; this is likely why the porn is referred to as mind expanding and superior to Edwin Abbott Abbott's work.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Picture of a right hand with fingers curved, thumb pointed away, with axes drawn to demonstrate the right-hand rule of physics.]\n:Alternatives to the Right-Hand Rule in vector multiplication:\n:[A slightly-open book with labeled axes drawn on.]\n:Book Rule: Open the front cover along the first vector and the back cover along the second.
