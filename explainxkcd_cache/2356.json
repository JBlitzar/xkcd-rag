Being rather subjective, {{w|Chinese constellations|different cultures}} have inculcated differences in their interpretations, some subtle and others less so, for the exact same objective views of the night sky. Even where the same groupings are recognised, distinct cultures can 'see' different forms behind that group of stars. However, observers in the southern hemisphere will see entirely new constellations not visible to those in the northern one, and vice-versa, whilst observing those patterns fully visible to both (on the {{w|ecliptic}}) as inverted and therefore may inspire vastly different conceptualised images or even connectivities. The {{w|International Astronomical Union}} has demarcated the sky into {{w|IAU designated constellations|88 constellations}}, mostly those known to ancient Greece (catalogued by Ptolemy) plus southern constellations designated by astronomers during the European Renaissance.\n\nRandall has taken one particular {{w|zodiac}} (or at least part of the hellenic one, closely tied to western astrology and still inspiring astronomical naming) and imagined further lines connecting stars to link up four separate constellations, to create a portmanteau constellation with a {{w|portmanteau}} name. In fact, this connection is half true, since Libra used to be the two claws of a much larger Scorpio, the larger constellation having been split in two when the twelve zodiac signs were set as they are now.\n\nThe four constellations used here are Scorpio (the scorpion), Libra (the scales), Virgo (the virgin/maiden) and Leo (the lion), sequentially spread across the sky in positions relating to a span of astrological dates running 'backwards' from late November through to late July. The name Randall gave this meta-constellation, however, uses a different order to combine as \"Virg(o, l)ibra(, )scorp(io & )leo\". Possibly \"Scorlibirgoleo\", or a similar mash-up with the same source order, did not roll together nicely enough for his liking.\n\nIn reality, any apparent proximity of stars on the {{w|celestial sphere}} does not guarantee an actual proximity in the depths of space, either within or between constellations. Knock-on effects from this renaming would not change actual scientific understanding, but it could have a knock-on effect upon star catalogues and databases if this object regrouping forces so many incidental name changes to the current referencing system, which is why the astronomers are upset (as indicated in the title text). Similarly, astrology's conceit based upon four separate 'characters' and life-paths, arising from birth-signs and planetary transits across four distinct areas of the sky, would lose 'precision' if forced to accept a single symbolic area in their stead. Astrologers would be very upset because their work (interpreted charitably) is related to understanding the influences of the stars on life on Earth; they might be concerned that \"{{w|Star-crossed|crossing the stars}}\" could lead to \"{{w|Disaster#Etymology|disaster}}\". It's not clear how Randall hoped to alter the practices of either group with his changes, but he was banned from the IAU for his efforts ([[:Category:Banned from conferences|not the first time this has happened]]). Randall previously mentioned being banned from the IAU in [[541: TED Talk]], but the reason stated in that comic was \"redefinition of the 'planet' to include the IAU presidents' mom\", so presumably he was reinstated and then banned again.\n\nThis is another [[:Category:Comics with red annotations|comic containing red annotations]] over a complex and established structure. This monstrosity is reminiscent of the infamous 2009 Dutch horror film known as {{w|The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede}}, in which three humans are bound together such that their digestive systems are connected in sequence. In this image, the head of Virgo appears to be connected to the hindquarters of Leo, and likewise the mouthparts of Scorpio are fixed to the bottom of the \"stand\" of Libra. Libra's stand appears to go under Virgo's dress; to form a complete \"celestial centipede\", it should attach to Virgo's hindquarters, but judging by the connection between stars, it probably (mercifully) connects to her foot.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Within a frame, a long title is written in a short arc above the drawn elements]\n:Virgibrascorpleo\n\n:[Upon a background of astrological imagery merged in accord, basic point-and-line astronomical/astrological representations of Scorpio, Libra, Virgo and Leo are illustrated.]\n:[(Scorpio ''may'' be slightly rotated/translated for aesthetic reasons.)]\n\n:[Red lines have been added to link stars in adjacent constellations.]\n:[ {{w|Pi Scorpii}}(Bottom left connection) is connected to {{w|Upsilon Librae}}]\n:[...also {{w|Beta Scorpii}}(Top left connection) may be connected to {{w|Theta Librae}}]\n:[ {{w|Alpha Librae}}(Middle connection) is connected to {{w|Mu Virginis}}]\n:[ {{w|Nu Virginis}}(Right connection) is connected to Beta Leonis (better known as {{w|Denebola}})]\n\n:[Caption below the frame]\n:I got kicked out of the International Astronomical Union for adding extra lines between the constellations to create a monstrosity.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Portmanteau]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Banned from conferences]]\n[[Category:Comics with red annotations]]"
