Wings that are only capable of generating 9% of the necessary lift  on Earth would allow one to fly if used on Titan.\n \nCueball now stands in front of an apparatus to do so; he is standing in a valley with a metal arch above him, and two pulleys that have a rope going from Cueball to one pulley to the other and to the pile of bricks that weigh 91% of his weight, so if he generates enough lift to cancel out 9% of his weight, then he will be able to lift himself and fly.\n\nThe experiment is a success. However, as Megan points out, his experiment has some problems, namely that he used hot glue for the wing joints and that he has friends into Greek mythology.\n\n{{w|Icarus}} is a Greek character known for his self-powered flight, which ended when the wax holding his wings together melted due to the sun's heat, and he fell to his death. This supposedly occurred because he ignored instructions not to fly too close to the Sun, a tragic example of hubris — extreme arrogance. Here, {{tvtropes|IcarusAllusion|Black Hat is bringing an artificial \"sun\" to \"Icarus\" to recreate the tragedy}}.\n\n[[Black Hat]] is standing on top of the arch with a powerful heat source, a {{w|heat lamp}}. The hot glue melts, then the wings fall apart, then Cueball falls.\n\nIn the title text, Randall asks that xkcd readers do not attempt to reproduce this. The reason for this is explained [[254: Comic Fragment|here]]. It could also simply be a media-standard \"Don't try this at home\" warning, as there are legitimate dangers to flying around unprotected. Sufficient height and a sudden loss of one's wings could indeed result in death (and deliberately causing someone to lose their wings and die or be injured would indeed get one arrested).\n\nOne thing to note about this comic is that Cueball is still attached via pulley to the bricks. These bricks, weighing down on the other side, should (obviously) slow his fall considerably. Of course, Black Hat could also cut the rope...{{citation needed}}\n\n==Physics==\n\nThe calculated figure of 9% is only correct if the temperature on Titan has been raised to be the same as Earth — which, for human-powered flight, would probably be necessary anyway. At Titan's normal temperature, you would only have to generate about 3% of your Earth body weight in lift, as the atmosphere is much denser.\n\nThe friction in normal ball-bearing pulleys when loaded with 182 % of a persons weight would likely be greater than 9 % of that weight. Cueball must be using futuristic super-low-friction pulleys.\n\nWhen the wings come off, Cueball is going to fall with an acceleration of about 0.047 g, or 21 times slower than a free fall (neglecting friction). The net downward force is 9 % of his weight, while the total inertia is 191 % of his body mass. So a fall from 21 meters (63 ft) will feel like a fall from one meter (3 ft), equivalent to the fall of someone who has hopped off a table. If he lands on his feet, he will not sustain injuries.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Titan's gravity is 14% of Earth's, and its atmosphere 50% denser.\n\n:Cueball: So if you can generate 9% of your body weight in lift, you can fly on Titan.\n\n:Cueball: With wings, a stage harness, a cable, and 91% of my weight in bricks, I want to test this.\n:[There is a heap of materials on the ground. Cueball is holding a stage harness.]\n\n:[Large diagram of a bridge, seemingly metal. A rope leads through pulleys tied to the bridge.
