Then, when Megan brings them into the same room for a moment, the argument settles. This effect is similar to what happens when people drive a car: they're more likely to get exasperated or angry at other drivers than they do when not driving, because the drivers can’t see each other’s faces or properly identify that they’re human in some way.\n\nIn the first two panels, [[Cueball]] is exchanging some possibly profane insults with the other [[Cueball]]. [[Megan]] takes hold of Cueball and flies him to the other one, so they see each other face to face. In this situation, each remains silent as neither has anything to say to the other.\n\nWhen Megan returns Cueball to his original computer, they resume their communication, but without the insults.\n\nThe title text states the theming of the comic, being that arguments over the internet are easier than in real life, because online, the user is arguing versus “text” rather than an actual human with thoughts and emotions.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is typing profanities into his computer.]\n:[Friend is typing profanities into his computer.]\n:[Megan floats in behind Cueball.]\n:[Megan lifts Cueball.]\n:[They are flying over mountains.]\n:[Megan and Cueball are floating in front of the friend and his computer.]\n:[She sets Cueball down in front of the friend and his computer.]\n:[Megan lifts Cueball again.]\n:[They are flying.]\n:[Megan sets Cueball down in his chair at his computer.]\n:[Cueball is typing at his computer.]\n:[Friend is typing at his computer.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
