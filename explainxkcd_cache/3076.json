The joke is that while the human narrator of Frost's poem (presumably Frost himself), confronted with two paths, could take only one of them and is left to [[584: Unsatisfied|contemplate the consequences of his choice]], the {{w|Photon|photonic}} narrator of the parody, thanks to {{w|Quantum superposition|quantum physics}}, is not compelled to choose one path over the other but can instead take both simultaneously, resulting in probabilistic {{w|quantum superposition}}, and is left to contemplate the consequences of ''that'' choice. {{w|Wave interference#Quantum interference|Quantum interference}}, referenced in the final line, is an effect of quantum superposition in which particles (including photons) interact with and influence themselves and other particles while in a superposition state.\n\nThe title text humorously makes a portmanteau out of 'photon' and {{w|Fear of missing out|'FOMO' (Fear Of Missing Out)}}, the concern over lost opportunities from choosing one path over another or choosing neither.\n\nThis comic was posted on April 14, [https://www.quantum.gov/happy-world-quantum-day-2025 World Quantum Day].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Original stanza 1\n!Parody\n|-\n|Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>And ''sorry I could not travel'' both<br/>''And'' be one traveler, ''long I stood''<br/>''And looked down one'' as far as I could<br/>''To where it bent'' in the undergrowth;\n|Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>And ''so of course I traveled'' both<br/>''Though'' be one traveler, ''still I could''<br/>''Explore down both'' as far as I could<br/>''Beyond the bends'' in the undergrowth;\n|}\n\nIn the original, the human narrator, operating at the scale of classical mechanics, contemplates the necessary choice between two mutually exclusive paths. In the parody, the photon, operating at the scale of quantum mechanics, readily explores both paths. At quantum scale, the \"roads\" and \"yellow woods\" are metaphorical.\n\nThe original contains two additional stanzas about choosing which road to take and sticking with that choice, which did not make it into the parody version.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Original stanza 4\n!Parody\n|-\n|I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br/>I took ''the one less travelled by,''<br/>And that has made ''all the difference.'' \n|I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br/>I took ''them both and recombined,''<br/>And that has made ''interference.''\n|}\n\nIn the original, the human narrator reflects subjectively on the (anticipated?) impact of the choice of road - whether for good or ill is not explicitly stated. In the parody, the photon states objectively the result ({{w|Wave interference#Quantum interference|quantum interference}}) of taking both paths at once.\n\nThe parody maintains the same rhyme scheme as the original, ABAAB. In the fourth line of the last stanza, \"recombined\" doesn't {{w|Perfect_and_imperfect_rhymes|perfectly}} rhyme with \"sigh\" and \"I\", but it shares the vowel in the last syllable, a form of {{w|assonance}}, and can be considered an {{w|Perfect_and_imperfect_rhymes#Imperfect_rhyme|imperfect rhyme}}. The third and fourth lines of the first stanza also don't perfectly rhyme since the rhyming words are the same (this is instead called an identical rhyme).\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A photon recites a poem.]\n:Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n:And so of course I traveled both\n:Though be one traveler, still I could\n:Explore down both as far as I could\n:Beyond the bends in the undergrowth...\n\n:...I shall be telling this with a sigh\n:Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,\n:I took them both and recombined,\n:And that has made interference.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Photon poetry\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Physics]]"
