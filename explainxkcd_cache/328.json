However, in this scenario, it turns out Cueball is not actually trying to solicit sex from [[Megan]] at all, but is just interested in setting up jokes. Megan's desire for actual casual sex therefore subverts his plan for comedy. He politely declines her offer and tries instead with a different joke using the classic {{w|snowclone}} priest and rabbi setup.\n\nThe title text continues the conversation, where Megan reveals that the bar is actually a \"casual sex bar\" and further suggests that priests and rabbis do in fact come to the bar frequently. This is in contrast to real life, where such bars would probably not be frequented by religious leaders.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan sits at a bar; Beret Guy cleans a glass from behind the counter. Cueball approaches.]\n:Cueball: So, how do you like your eggs in the morning?\n\n:[Closeup on Megan.]\n:Megan: Ooh, sunny side up.\n:Cueball [off-panel]: Oh. Huh.\n\n:[Wide shot with Beret Guy, Megan, and Cueball again.]\n:Megan: Is that a problem?\n:Cueball: Well, it's just that I was trying to set you up for the \"unfertilized\" line.\n\n:[Only Megan and Cueball are shown, with Cueball standing farther away from Megan.]\n:Megan: Ah. Bad timing; I'm actually looking for casual sex.\n:Megan: ...Interested?\n:Cueball: I'd love to, but I've got like 20 more jokes to set up tonight. Hey, have you seen a priest and a rabbi?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
