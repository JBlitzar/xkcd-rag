As with the previous comic, the titles aren't always direct synonyms with the original (Indiana Jones as ''Professor Whip''), but now it seems to be even more exaggerated, sometimes making synonyms of the plot synopsis instead of the subtitle (\"Vitamin Water\" refers to the Fountain of Youth rather than the ''Stranger Tides'').\n\nThis set includes ''Wandboy'' (''{{w|Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter}}''), ''Puncher'' (''{{w|Rocky}}''), ''Tropical Boaters'' (''{{w|Pirates of the Caribbean}}''), and ''Professor Whip'' (''{{w|Indiana Jones}}''). The ''is in Another Movie'' title in the ''Professor Whip'' series differs from the other titles in that it does not reference the plot of the movie. The more dismissive reference may be due to ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' being poorly received by fans of the series.\n\nThe title text is a reference to the TV series ''Game of Thrones'', based on the book series ''A Song of Ice and Fire''. All of these titles are direct synonyms, but such that they remove most of the meaning from the titles. For instance, nobody actually cares about the physical object of a throne, but the political power it represents. Birds eating in general have a very different implied meaning than crows feasting specifically, as groups of crows only gather to eat when there is a lot of food, such as a corpse, and as such have a strong cultural association with death and slaughter.\n\n{{spoiler|Many of the following explanations contain spoilers for ''{{w|Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter}}'', ''{{w|Pirates of the Caribbean}}'', and ''{{w|Indiana Jones}}''.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Synonym\n! Real Title\n! Explanation\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Wandboy'' (''Harry Potter'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''Wandboy and the Magic Rock''\n| ''{{w|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}''\n| In this series, wizards and witches use wands to perform magic. The titular Philosopher's Stone is indeed very magical. The first installment of the series is also known as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the US.\n|-\n| ''Wandboy and the Hidden Room''\n| ''{{w|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}''\n| The {{w|Hogwarts#Chamber_of_Secrets|Chamber of Secrets}} is a very well hidden room that is central to the plot of the second book.\n|-\n| ''Wandboy and the Fugitive''\n| ''{{w|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}''\n| Azkaban is a fictional maximum-security prison.

Dying phoenixes go up in flames, only to be reborn out of the ashes shortly afterward. The Order of the Phoenix is an association of wizards founded by Albus Dumbledore, whose distinctive pet is a phoenix.\n|-\n| ''Wandboy and the Book Owner''\n| ''{{w|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}''\n| In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Harry's Potions textbook was previously owned by a \"Half-Blood Prince.\" Therefore, \"Half-Blood Prince\" is replaced with \"book owner.\"\n|-\n| ''Wandboy and the Magic Stuff (1/2)''\n| ''{{w|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1}}''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | The ''Deathly Hallows'' are three magical items that play an important part in the plot of the final movies. Being a wand, a rock, and a cloak, these objects are all quite powerful, so they are called the magic stuff. See also {{w|The Tales of Beedle the Bard#\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\"}}.\n|-\n| ''Wandboy and the Magic Stuff (2/2)''\n| ''{{w|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2}}''\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Puncher'' (''Rocky'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''Puncher''\n| ''{{w|Rocky}}''\n| rowspan=\"5\" | The protagonist Rocky is a boxer. In {{w|boxing}} boxers attempt to punch their opponent until they are knocked out.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n| ''Puncher II''\n| ''{{w|Rocky II}}''\n|-\n| ''Puncher III''\n| ''{{w|Rocky III}}''\n|-\n| ''Puncher IV''\n| ''{{w|Rocky IV}}''\n|-\n| ''Puncher V''\n| ''{{w|Rocky V}}''\n|-\n| ''Puncher Lastname''\n| ''{{w|Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa}}''\n| Balboa is Rocky's last-name, also known as surname.\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Tropical Boaters'' (''Pirates of the Caribbean'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''Tropical Boaters: Spooky Boat''\n| ''{{w|Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl}}''\n| The Black Pearl is a ship crewed by \"spooky\" ghost pirates.\n|-\n| ''Tropical Boaters: Angry Wormface''\n| ''{{w|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}''\n| This film's villain has (worm-like) octopus tentacles growing on his face.\n|-\n| ''Tropical Boaters: Boats Everywhere''\n| ''{{w|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End}}''\n| This film includes a huge fleet of ships.\n|-\n| ''Tropical Boaters: Vitamin Water''\n| ''{{w|Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides}}''\n| \"Vitamin Water\" describes the Fountain of Youth.\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Professor Whip'' (''Indiana Jones'')<br/>\n|-\n| ''Professor Whip and the Box of God''\n| ''{{w|Raiders of the Lost Ark}}''\n| Indiana Jones is Professor of Archeology and skillfully wields a whip as part of his equipment. Later the movie was marketed as Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. The \"Lost Ark\" of the title is the Ark of the Covenant, a mythical box containing the contract between the Jewish people and YHWH.\n|-\n| ''Professor Whip and the Scary Church''\n| ''{{w|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom}}''\n| A direct synonym for the title.\n|-\n| ''Professor Whip Looks for a Cup''\n| ''{{w|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade}}''\n| Central to this film's plot is the search for the {{w|Holy Grail}}, which is supposedly a cup from which Jesus drank shortly before his death.\n|-\n| ''Professor Whip is in Another Movie''\n| ''{{w|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull}}''\n| ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was widely regarded as the worst in the series, with opinion even divided in hindsight, and was the last one at the time at the time of the comic's publication. Therefore the \"synonym\" is simply that it is \"another movie\", to imply relative indifference, though at least [[566: Matrix Revisited|it was acknowledged as existing]]. It could also be a matter of having given up on finding sufficiently synonymical words that handily reflect the plot points, as well as the {{w|MacGuffin}} named in the actual title.\n|-\n!colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\"|''A Song of Ice and Fire''<br/>\n|-\n| ''Hot and Cold Music''\n| ''{{w|A Song of Ice and Fire}}''\n| A series of fantasy books written George R.
