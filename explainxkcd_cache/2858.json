This was a topical comic, as Thanksgiving in the United States in 2023 was on November 23, the day after the posting of this comic.\n\nIn the first panel, Cueball is depicted sitting at a computer, presumably writing an article or blog post titled \"How to Win Political Arguments with Your Awful Relatives at Thanksgiving Dinner\" - a common topic for 'filler' articles at this time of year. Such articles are based on the perception that political arguments are common at holiday dinners. This is likely based on the idea that people will tend to avoid relatives with \"awful\" political views, but holiday dinners carry the expectation that the whole family will be together, making such arguments difficult to avoid. \n\nMegan challenges this perception, citing [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/poll-nobody-fights-thanksgiving_n_5deece02e4b07f6835b7eab6 an article in ''Huffington Post''] which reports on a poll which found that only 16% of families reported discussing politics at Thanksgiving dinner, and only 3% reporting having argued about politics. She also points out that Cueball's family has political views that are \"mostly fine\". This is probably not especially uncommon, as families tend to share similar experiences and backgrounds, which inform their political opinions. Where disagreements do occur, it's common for those to be minor, and not the subject of particularly emotional arguments. In addition, where politics are a source of friction within a family, most learn not to bring it up at holiday gatherings, precisely to avoid such arguments. \n\nThe misperception at the root of this may be a case of selection bias. There certainly are families in which members hold opposing political views{{Citation needed}} with such emotional fervor that gatherings typically devolve into arguments. Since those arguments can be so intense and emotional (and often personally hurtful), the people involved are far more likely to relate their experiences to others, both in person and in media (such as in articles, columns, and portrayal in fiction). By contrast, people who have quiet, undramatic family dinners are less likely to get attention. This can give rise to the perception that heated political arguments are the norm for such gatherings. \n\nThe comic concludes by revealing that Cueball's family, rather than arguing about politics, tends to argue about ''{{w|The Rise of Skywalker}}'', a controversial recent entry in the {{w|Star Wars}} franchise, with Megan agreeing that his aunt \"brings that up a lot\". The joke is that Cueball's family, like him, tend to have nerdy, pop-culture-based passions, and those are areas that are far more likely to result in family debates. The title text extends this theme by referencing the mother's devotion to the 2003 movie ''{{w|The Core}}'' (widely considered a contender for \"{{w|The Core#Reception|all-time-worst 'science in a movie' winner}}\") and her insistence on watching it annually during Thanksgiving is mentioned as a bone of contention within the family. This underscores the idea that perceptions of a \"normal\" family gathering (ie, arguing about politics) aren't necessarily applicable to most families. The individual character and eccentricities of each family are far more likely to define what their holidays are like.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting on an office chair at his desk typing on his stationary computer as Megan walks up behind him.
