The James Bond film franchise (particularly in its early years) had a reputation for villains capturing James (often alongside a {{w|Bond Girl|female companion}}) and placing him or them in overly complex death traps, rather than simply shooting them (which, of course, consistently allows Bond to engineer an escape). \n\nIn this scenario, the trap consists of slowly lowering Bond and his companion into a pit of venomous snakes. The intent, presumably, being that the very common fear of snakes, combined with a likely slow and painful death from the snakebites, would kill them in a particularly gruesome way. However, Bond's companion in this strip is [[Hairbun]]. Rather than being frightened, she's fascinated by the various species of snakes represented there, including one she hasn't seen before, and asks to be lowered ''faster'', so she can observe it more closely before she loses sight of it.\n\nThe caption reveals that Hairbun is a biologist, and comments that many things that would be considered elaborate death traps in fiction (such as a giant pit full of different kinds of snakes), would be a good gift for a biologist.\n\nThe title text reveals that Hairbun has identified at least some of the species represented in the pit and points out that a lot of them are non-venomous. While that might seem mildly reassuring, the way she phrases it implies that she's also identified venomous varieties in there. Moreover, she can also guess which species the villain mistook them for and offers help in correctly finding and selecting venomous species in the future. Her unprompted willingness to do this suggests that she's genuinely so enthusiastic about snakes that it overwhelms any fear for her own safety.\n\nThe scientific implications of Bond villain traps were also referenced in [[123: Centrifugal Force]], which also features Black Hat.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[James Bond, drawn as Hairy, and Hairbun are hanging upside down from ropes attached to one of their ankles. Underneath them is a pit with many snakes. Hairbun is pointing down, while Black Hat to the left is operating a lever. Bond is yelling at Black Hat, indicated by lines emanating from his head. Hairbun is also yelling, but that is in the direction of the snakes beneath them. There seems to be many snakes in the pit, at least eight heads can be seen, and there are also snakes whose heads are not visible. At least six snakes are partly outside the pit. They have different patterns of spots, shades, and stripes.]\n:Bond: You won't get away with this!\n:Hairbun: Ooh! Ooh! That one is a new species for me!\n:Hairbun: Hey, can you lower me faster? It's getting away!\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:There's a surprising amount of overlap between \"Good presents for biologists\" and \"Things villains want to do to James Bond.\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]"
