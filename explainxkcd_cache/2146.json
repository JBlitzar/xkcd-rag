More specifically, the argument would go \"I am not [something generally considered distasteful], but [a more specific statement most people consider part of that general statement]\". The first part of such a statement can sometimes be viewed as an apology or an excuse because the person talking knows that the second part might upset people. A common example would be \"I'm not a racist, but I don't think we should let refugees from Africa into Europe.\" The idea of denying help to people from Africa will be seen as racist by many people, so the speaker tries to preempt that opinion of themself.\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] is having a conversation with [[Ponytail]], who lists several seemingly unrelated but agreeable positions, such as reducing {{w|car accidents}}, treating {{w|arson}} as a serious crime, and approving of {{w|American Humane|\"No Animals were Harmed\" disclaimers}} in modern media, with Cueball wondering when the \"but..\" of the statement will come, and conjuring increasingly outrageous images of what Ponytail could have in mind that involves violating all of them, for example some sort of reckless fiery car stunt involving animals.\n\nNotably, the \"and\" normally serves as an earlier indicator that a list is coming to the end, as it always comes right before the final entry. Perhaps, Cueball seems to have missed this, hence the continued apprehension. But being immediately proceeded by a comma indicates either it is a {{w|Conjunction (grammar)#Coordinating conjunctions|coordinating sub-clause}} or, perhaps, an {{w|Oxford comma}}. (Although it seems unlikely that it is the latter, as it is most often applied to a string of more than three items being grouped, and is often considered more confusing than the situation it is supposed to grammatically clarify.)\n\nThe title text gives another example of a sentence that will probably be followed by a \"but\". {{w|Multi-level marketing|Multi-level marketing schemes}} and the {{w|Spanish Inquisition}} are both considered bad in very different ways, so the implication that if the speaker has to apologize in advance for sounding like defending both of them, they must have a remarkably troubling idea in mind, involving somehow using a version of the Spanish Inquisition as an MLM scheme. \n\nAnother possible explanation would be that when people hear a sentence that starts with \"Listen, I'm\" they tend to wait for the \"but\", and the longer it takes the more tension it may cause them, while the speaker may never intend to say \"but\". Similar ideas were used for [[365: Slides]], [[559: No Pun Intended]] and [[2032: Word Puzzles]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is talking to Cueball, while holding her hands up with both palms up.
