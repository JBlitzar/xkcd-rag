The comic depicts an office Halloween party, which is a common event on the celebration of Halloween. A \"{{w|Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted house}}\" is a house or other building/room designed to induce fright in the participants, typically by including well-known/cultural scary elements such as vampires or zombies. The haunted house in this comic is tailored to scare members of these organizations by suggesting a world where nothing is standardized (e.g. different electrical wiring from state to state). The title text furthers the joke by implying that something which is usually standardized (door/doorknob interfaces) would be different from city to city even within a state. Further, it confounds ''types'' of \"knobs\", where \"[https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&q=lexington+knobs Lexington]\" is a hardware style collection for actual drawer knobs and such, whereas the \"Louisville Knobs\" are a set of geological mound features ({{w|Knobs region}}) in Kentucky. While such a joke would likely only irritate ISO members, the comic jokes that they fear even the idea of such a world.\n\nIn reality, the electrical supply is standardized within any given country ({{w|Electricity sector in Japan#Transmission|usually...}}), but it does vary worldwide, with different countries providing different voltages, frequency, and outlet shapes. The International Electrotechnical Commission maintains [https://www.iec.ch/world-plugs a web site where these differences are catalogued.] International travelers often require adapters that will plug into different outlets and may adjust the voltage and/or frequency to one their devices can use, something for which standardization would be much appreciated, although the cost of such worldwide standardization would likely render it infeasible. \n\nOther comics about standardization include [[927: Standards]], [[1179: ISO 8601]], [[1643: Degrees]].\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Ponytail stands gesturing towards an off-panel location, facing Megan and Cueball.
