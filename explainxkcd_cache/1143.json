The single guy in the comic owns a home surrounded by an abundance of portals, which makes it an attractive destination for the three friends who contact him via the computer. They are obviously not really friends of the guy, but just wish to come by because of the portals.\n\nThe portals in the comic are controlled by the green \"Enlightened\" team (and have links and a field), making them resource sources for the \"Enlightened\" team, and targets for the blue \"Resistance\" team.\n\n{{w|Foursquare}}, referenced in the title text, is another service that lets users check into places they visit for discounts in a similar way to how Ingress players visit portals for points. Unlike Foursquare places, which are businesses and public places such as parks, Ingress portals also include historic houses that are still private residences, as well as churches, so Ingress is more likely to reward people visiting a friend's house. \"Space noises\" refers to the ambient sounds when playing Ingress.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three people around a computer. One of them is typing.]\n:Typing: Hey, party tonight?\n:Typing: We'd all love to come see your new place!\n:Reply (through monitor): Wait, what?\n\n:[Cut to guy sitting at a laptop.]\n:Reply (through the guy's monitor): We want to hang out!\n:Guy typing: We're not, like, good friends.\n:Reply (through the guy's monitor): I know, but we were thinking about it and we really like you!\n\n:[Cut back to the three friends.]\n:Typing: You should have us over tonight!\n:Typing: For, like, an hour.\n:Typing: It'll be fun!\n:Reply (through monitor): Well, uh, sure.\n\n:[Cut to color-inverted image of the guy's house. Four Enlightened-controlled Ingress portals are in the guy's back yard.]\n:Friends (off-screen): ''YESSSS!''\n:Guy (from inside his house): I still don't get why you're suddenly so excited to hang out.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Computers]]"
