Imagine how surprised the person must be when they wake up and discover their whole house has been rearranged! A {{w|skeptic}} is someone who questions knowledge, facts and beliefs, especially of supernatural phenomena like the existence of {{w|poltergeists}} which Black Hat is trying to imitate with his rearranging and scratching noises.\n\nThe American Skeptics Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting skeptical and critical thinking in education and public discourse. The executive director and chief editor of the {{w|Skeptic_(U.S._magazine)|Skeptic Magazine}}, {{w|Michael Shermer}}, is a leading proponent of skepticism, and has written many books and articles debunking pseudoscience, fringe science, quack medicine, alien abductions, conspiracy theories and [[373|supernatural phenomena]]. The [http://www.skeptic.com Skeptic Society website] and Skeptic magazine feature a lot of material debunking anecdotal accounts of these phenomena, explaining how events like \"hauntings\" could have occurred without supernatural intervention.\n\nOne of the premises of modern skepticism is that the supernatural is not rejected out of hand; if someone came up with a proper scientific hypothesis that predicted something supernatural and that hypothesis was proven beyond reasonable doubt, a skeptic would accept that the supernatural thing in question was probably correct.\n\nIn the title text [[Cueball]] realizes that Black Hat has (probably intentionally) ruined his antique table by demonstrating his silent hammer on it in the first panel.\n\nBlack Hat's tools are seen in two boxes labeled \"Drills\" and \"Non-Drills\", likely a reference to the phrase \"this is not a drill\", used to differentiate an emergency situation from a practice of procedure for such.\n\nNote that this comic is numbered {{w|666 (number)|666}}, the number of the beast in {{w|Christian theology}}, which is often associated with the evil and supernatural.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is hammering something on a table.]\n:Cueball: Whatâ€”\n:Black Hat: Silent hammer. I've made a set of silent tools.\n:Cueball: Why?\n:Hammer: <small>''woosh woosh woosh''</small>\n\n:Black Hat: Stealth carpentry. Breaking into a house at night and moving windows, adjusting walls, etc.\n:[He takes his silent hammer over to a tool bench with other things on it. Two boxes underneath are labeled \"Drills\" and \"Non-Drills.\"]\n\n:Black Hat, narrating: After a week or so of questioning his own sanity, the owner will stay up to watch the house at night. I'll make scratching noises in the walls, pipe in knockout gas, move him up to his bed, and never bother him again.\n:[The events he's describing are shown in two mini-panels below.]\n\n:[Zoom in on Black Hat, with Cueball off-panel to the left.]\n:Cueball, off-panel: Nice prank, I guess, but what's the point?\n:Black Hat: Check out the owner's card, on the table.\n:Cueball, off-panel: Chair of the American Skeptics Society? Oh, god.\n:Black Hat: Yeah, this doesn't end well for him.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic, along with its title text, is used on TV Tropes as the image for {{tvtropes|Gaslighting}}.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
