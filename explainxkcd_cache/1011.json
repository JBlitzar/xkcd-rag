It may relate to his other comics about why he shouldn't be allowed to have access to babies.\n\nThis is a list of the names with a short description:\n* Ponzi - An Italian surname, most often associated with \"{{w|Ponzi scheme}}\".\n* Eeemily - A corruption of \"Emily\". May also be a marketing plug for the {{w|Asus Eee}} brand.\n* Fire Fire - Even a single \"Fire\" would be odd as a name, at least in the American dialects. It would also not be a good idea to call your child's name in a crowded place.{{citation needed}} This name could also be the inverse of \"Ice Ice\", a common joke baby name referencing Ice Ice Baby.\n* Chipotla - A frequent mispronounciation of {{w|Chipotle|chipotle}} chili or the popular {{w|Chipotle Mexican Grill}} restaurant chain. Many people would readily attempt to correct you when you called your child's name. Possibly reads as a feminine version of ''chipotle''.\n* Astamouthe - Could be pronounced \"{{w|Ass to mouth}}\".\n* Eggsperm - A child is conceived by combining an egg and a sperm, this child's name is conceived by combining the names of the two things.\n* [sound of record scratch] - This cannot be spelled or reliably pronounced.{{Citation needed}} Likely a reference to any movie where a record scratch plays and the protagonist says \"that's me\".\n* Parsley - {{w|Parsley}} is an herb and is not commonly used as a name unlike other herbs like {{w|Rosemary}} and {{w|Sage}}. It is, however, probably the least terrible name on this list. \n* Hot'n'Juicy Ann - \"Ann\" is a normal name. Prefacing it with the sexual \"Hot'n'Juicy\" would not be appropriate for a child's name.\n* Ovari - Female reproductive organ, {{w|Ovary|misspelled}}.\n* Friendly - Odd enough on its own, but when referring to her possessions it would create confusion with the restaurant {{w|Friendly's}}. Can also be humorous in introductions - \"Hi I'm Friendly and I hate you.\"\n* Sean (pronounced \"seen\") - While this isn't an incorrect pronunciation, the more common pronunciation would be \"Shawn\". Very likely a reference to the name of the actor Sean Bean (whose name is pronounced Shawn Been), which uses the exact same pairing of letters for two pronunciations. \n* Joyst - Corruption of \"Joyce\". May also refer to the term \"joist\", which is a beam used in construction to support ceilings or floors, or the first part of the word \"joystick\", a video game controller.\n\nA further analysis of baby names is presented by Randall in the [[Blag]] post \"[http://blog.xkcd.com/2014/01/31/the-baby-name-wizard/ The Baby Name Wizard]\".\n\nRenesmee (from the title text) is the name of {{w|Renesmee Cullen#Renesmee Cullen|Renesmee Cullen}}, who is the baby born in the book and movie {{w|Breaking Dawn}} to parents Edward and Bella. Edward and Bella get \"Renesmee\" from an amalgamation of the names of Bella's mother, Ren√©e, and Edward's adoptive mother, Esme. [[Randall]]'s point is that all those names are terrible, but (arguably) not nearly as terrible as the name Renesmee.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a desk, thinking with his hand on his chin, his other hand holding a pen over a piece of paper.
