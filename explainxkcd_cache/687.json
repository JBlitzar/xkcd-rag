Here Cueball is giving a talk and uses this trick to ''convince'' his listeners that the {{w|Toyota Prius}} combined {{w|United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA}} gas mileage is somehow connected to the constant ''{{W|Pi|π}}'' via the {{w|Planck energy}}, the pressure at the {{w|Inner_core|Earth's core}} and the width of the {{w|English Channel}}. \n\nScientists — often physicists — use dimensional analysis to quickly check if a given formula can possibly relate to a physical system, because if you end up with an equation claiming that Joules are meters, something is clearly wrong. Dimensional analysis here refers to the check if both sides of the equation arrive at the same physical unit when the units of all variables get plugged into the equation. This requires knowledge of the system of units and the relation between different physical units. Cueball uses the following equation to make a mockery of the practice:\n\n<math>\\frac{\\text{Planck energy}}{\\text{Pressure at the core of the Earth}} \\times  \\frac{\\text{Prius combined EPA gas mileage}}{\\text{Minimum width of the English Channel}} = \\pi</math>\n\n===Dimensional analysis===\nThe right hand side is dimensionless, it's the constant ''π'' = 3.14... which is defined by the relation of two lengths, the circumference and the diameter of a circle. The left hand side requires to plug in the dimensions of the named physical quantities:\n\n*Planck energy: given in Joules [J]\n*Pressure at the core of the Earth: often given in Pascals [Pa]\n** In this case, the relationship is used of 1 Pascal [Pa] = 1 Joule per cubic meter [J/m³]\n*Prius combined EPA gas mileage: miles per gallon, given in meters per cubic meter [m/m³]\n**Fuel efficiency has two formats that are commonly used: length per volume and volume per length. The former must be used here in order to get the units to cancel correctly.\n*Minimum width of the English Channel: given in meters [m]\n\nWhen plugged into the left-hand side, this amounts to:\n\n<math>\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^3}} \\times \\frac{\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{m}^3}}{\\text{m}} = \\text{m}^3 \\times \\frac{1}{\\text{m}^3} = 1</math>\n\nNote that for dimensional analysis constant factors are not taken into account. Here square brackets are used to denote dimensional analysis. In the above equation the unit of energy (joule) as well as all the unit of volume (cubic meter) cancel out each other.\n\nAnother aspect of the comic is that sometimes dimension analysis of equations that were not derived but rather \"made up\" can provide insight. For instance the inverse of gas mileage, fuel consumption per distance, is dimensionally a surface. If a car consumes 10 liters per 100 km, i.e. 10 dm<sup>3</sup> / 100 km, this value has a dimension of m<sup>3</sup> / m = m<sup>2</sup>. This surface corresponds to the area of an imagined cylinder (or other prism) of fuel along the road that the car consumes as it rides along, 0.1 mm<sup>2</sup> in the example. However, in reality such an equation would have to be somehow \"motivated\", which is more of an art than science and requires great experience in the field the equation should relate to. The presented equation combines values that have no immediate causal relation with each other, so it does not make sense. Furthermore, since the values have absolutely no causal relation to each other, the ratios presented are simple coincidence; despite Cueball's claim, building a better Prius would not cause any changes to the English Channel.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text also refers to this, as a higher pressure at Earth's core could also balance the equation, keeping the result constant equal to ''π''. The Planck energy is an absolute, however, so it is not mentioned as a way to balance the next version of Prius.\n\n===Some numbers for this calculation===\nThe {{w|Planck energy}} is the only nearly exact value we do have. Compared to other Planck values it is very large (macroscopic).\n E_planck = 1.956 x 10<sup>9</sup> J\n\nPressure at the {{w|Inner_core#Temperature_and_pressure|core}} of the Earth ranges from 330 to 360 gigapascals.\nUsing a simple value like this:\n P_core = 350 GPa = 3.5 x 10<sup>11</sup> J/m³\n\nPrius combined {{w|Toyota_Prius#Fuel_economy_and_emissions|EPA gas mileage}}:\nFor the third generation (from 2010) the [https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=26425 combined EPA gas mileage] is 50 miles per gallon.\n 50 mpg => 21,000,000 m/m³\n\nMinimum width of the {{w|English Channel}} is about\n 33.1&nbsp;km = 33,100&nbsp;m\n\nCalculating from these values you will get ''π'' = 3.54... that is pretty close to ''π'' = 3.14... while using a Planck value. According to Cueball this will be within the experimental error (the combined error for all four numbers - none are exact numbers). For instance if you tried the ePrius you would may get closer to pi — as the distance per fuel quantity in real life usage usually is somewhat lower than the standardized test value advertised — and that would reduce the result.\n\n[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28Planck+Energy%29%2F%28Pressure+at+the+Earth%27s+core%29*%282010+Prius+combined+EPA+Gas+Mileage%29%2F%2833.1+km%29 Wolfram|Alpha can find most of the statistics and do the calculations.]\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby:\n:Abusing dimensional analysis\n\n:[On a blackboard.]\n:(Planck energy/Pressure at the Earth's core) x (Prius combined EPA gas mileage/Minimum width of the English Channel) = π\n\n:[Cueball indicates this equation with a pointer in front of a class.]\n:Cueball: It's correct to within experimental error, and the units check out. It must be a fundamental law.\n:Student: But what if they build a better Prius?\n:Cueball: ''Then England will drift out to sea.''\n\n==Trivia==\nAfter this comic was released, Toyota released a better Prius. As of the [https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=26425&id=48861 2025 model year] achieving 57 mpg, England must have drifted out to sea by ~4.5km, making the English Channel about 37.7 kilometers wide.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
