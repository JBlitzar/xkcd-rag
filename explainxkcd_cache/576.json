Who mails a bobcat?'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] wrote a script that searches online shopping sites for items that cost US$1 with free shipping. Because the script is programmed to use an account with a $365 balance, this script will buy one random item per day for a full year. [[Megan]] comments that Cueball might just end up with \"lots of crap\" but he replies that he might get something interesting.\n\nOver five days the script orders a length of rubber hose, a ski mask, a bear trap, a map of {{w|The Pentagon}} and \"lube\" (sexual lubrication). This pattern prompts Cueball to stop the script out of fear of being placed on a FBI watch list; to a paranoid passerby, the purchased items make Cueball look like a terrorist who plans to kidnap and torture federal employees. And also a {{w|pervert}}.\n\nIn the title text a sixth item is sent, a {{w|bobcat}}. This is a reference to [[325: A-Minus-Minus]] where [[Black Hat]] delivered a bobcat instead of a chair.\n\n\"Every FBI watch list ever\" was also referenced in the [[Expensive Shoe Box]] chapter of [[What If? 2]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at his computer.]\n:Cueball: I love getting packages.\n\n:[Megan enters and Cueball turns towards her.]\n:Cueball: I set up a script to search eBay et. al. for $1 items with free shipping.\n\n:[Cueball comes home with a backpack on his back and find a package waiting for him on his doorstop.]\n:Cueball: I gave it $365, so each day it can buy me something random.\n\n:[Cueball, again sitting at his computer.]\n:Megan (off-screen): What if you just end up with lots of crap?\n:Cueball: I'll give it away. \n:Cueball: But I'm sure I'll end up with some interesting stuff.\n\n:[The next five panels have a caption in a black frame at the top. The caption is written first for each panel. In the first panel Cueball has unpacked a hose. The paper lies in tatters on the floor. Megan stands next to him.]\n:Day 1: Length of rubber hose\n:Cueball: Could be handy around the house.\n\n:[Cueball stands with a black item and the packaging material it came in. Megan looks on.]\n:Day 2: Ski mask\n:Cueball: It's spring, but hey.\n\n:[Cueball is standing alone with a bear trap and the box it came in on the floor.]\n:Day 3: Bear trap\n:Cueball: Huh.\n\n:[Megan is back as Cueball looks at a piece of paper that came in an envelope.]\n:Day 4: Tourist map of the Pentagon.\n:Megan: Uh oh.\n\n:[Cueball is standing alone with a bottle of lube in one hand and the box it came in in the other hand.]\n:Day 5: Lube\n:Cueball: I'm stopping this before I end up on every F.B.I. watch list ever.\n\n==Trivia==\nSomeone has set up an [http://bobcatinabox.com/ actual service] inspired by this comic, which does exactly what this comic describes, and has been featured in the advertisements section to the left.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Bobcats]]\n[[Category:Money]]"
