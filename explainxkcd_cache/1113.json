We need to build a secure TWO-day-before-retirement safe room.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic plays with the TV and film trope of {{tvtropes|Retirony}}, in which a cop is killed in action only a short time before (often the day before) retirement, usually producing a sense of even greater tragedy in the timing of the death. The humor of this strip arises from the notion that, given so many policemen are killed the day before retirement, retiring cops could be sequestered in a secure facility on the day before their retirement to avoid retirony. Unfortunately this merely results in tragedy when a cop is killed the day before being sequestered.\n\nThe title text is a reference to the reactionary nature of security procedures often put in place in the aftermath of an incident, and how they typically fail to address the root cause of the problem. If the logic expressed in the title text was followed repeatedly, eventually the number of days police officers spent in the secure room would encompass their entire career. Perhaps even quicker, if combined with another expandable scheme designed to protect rookie cops from similar {{tvtropes|FirstDayFromHell|'first day accidents'}}.\n\nSee also the {{w|Unexpected hanging paradox|paradox of the \"unexpected hanging\"}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:([[Hairbun]], [[Danish]] and [[Cueball]] are standing in the background by a coffin. A second Cueball, as the policeman and [[Ponytail]], as the policewoman, are standing in the foreground.)\n:Ponytail: Good cop. It's a real shameâ€”\n:Ponytail: He was just one day away from getting put in the locked, heavily guarded room where all cops stay for the last day before they retire.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
