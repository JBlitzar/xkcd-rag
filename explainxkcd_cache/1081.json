They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.|{{w|Mark Twain}} ([https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mark_Twain#Misattributed probably])}}\n\n[[Cueball]] is arguing with a {{w|conspiracy theorist}} who believes in some {{rw|conspiracy}}, who is sitting in front of his computer talking back. They are probably using {{w|Skype}}, {{w|FaceTime}}, or another video calling service, as Cueball later asks him to watch closely, holding his phone up to show the other guy what he is doing. \n\nCueball's opponent seems to ignore all reliable sources, like {{w|Snopes}} and {{w|Wikipedia}} on top of several {{w|Academic journal|journals}}, instead preferring sources that are seemingly not credible (but that do agree with him). These conspiracy \".net\" pages typically just have a black background and use several different sizes of fonts. Their belief seems to be the larger the font (and possibly the brighter the foreground colors, or other purely stylistic elements), the more convincing. It should be noted that\".net\" is used here as a catch-all for privately run websites. Of course a \".com\", \".org\" or other generic TLD can be used just the same for unreliable content. Cueball cannot take these kinds of sources seriously, as websites can be made by anyone and have little limitations. The maker of a private website does not need to show sources of information or even their name. As such, these websites are notoriously unreliable. [http://zapatopi.net/blackhelicopters/ The Truth about Black Helicopters] is a (satirical) example of one such website, supposedly explaining the truth behind government \"Black Helicopters\".\n \nThe conspiracy theorist insists that by trusting reliable sources, Cueball is simply buying into the cover-up, suggesting that all those journalists are somehow brainwashed. Cueball says he can win the argument, and will show him how, but then ceases to argue further in favor of going down a {{w|waterslide}} while holding up the phone to show the other guy how to have a good time. Since conspiracy theorists tend to be [[wikt:intransigent|intransigent]], Cueball sees himself as the victor after ceasing to argue with a guy who cannot be argued with, and instead decides to have some fun. This is made even more satisfying for Cueball by the fact that it makes his opponent angry. It's likely that this is also a reference to the ''[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/your-argument-is-invalid \"Your Argument is Invalid\"]'' meme.\n\nThe joke here is also in the title of the comic which is ''[http://imgur.com/EKkAXgR Argument Victory]'' something that is very hard to achieve by on the web... Cueball won this victory not by arguing but by stopping this argument he was having with someone that could/would not be argued with, and instead enjoys going down a waterslide.\n\nThe title text points out that belief in a conspiracy presupposes that those with the power to carry out the conspiracy actually have a plan, a situation which might be found more \"comforting\" than the alternative that those in power are just muddling through with no plan at all. This concept is revisited in [[1274: Open Letter]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, looking right, is talking at his smartphone while holding it up in front of his head using both hands.]\n:Cueball: I can't believe you're so wrong. I'm backed by Snopes, Wikipedia, and a half-dozen journals. You're citing .net pages with black backgrounds and like 20 fonts each.\n\n:[A conspiracy theorist is sitting in front of this lap top at his desk looking left. He has his hair combed down. He is talking to Cueball via his laptop, probably Skyping.]\n:Conspiracy theorist: It's sad how you buy into the official story so unquestioningly. \n:Conspiracy theorist: Guess some people ''prefer'' to stay asleep.\n\n:[Back to Cueball who has lowered his phone a bit. The reply from the conspiracy theorist is shown to come out of the phone with a jagged arrow and likewise speech bubble.]\n:Cueball: Watch closelyâ€” I'm about to win this argument.\n:Conspiracy theorist (reply from phone): How?\n\n:[Cueball is sitting at the very top of a waterslide preparing to descend.]\n:Cueball: By ''going down a waterslide''.\n\n:[A split panel, with a close-up of the conspiracy theorist above and below Cueball is sliding down the waterslide with both hands above his head, water splashing up behind him as he holds his smartphone above the water in one hand.]\n:Conspiracy theorist: So? What does that prove?\n:Cueball: ''Wheee..''\n\n:[Another split panel, this time a smaller part is used for the close-up of the conspiracy theorist above and below Cueball has more of this panels space for sliding down to the bottom of the waterslide with both hands above his head, water still splashing up behind him as he continues to keep his smartphone above the water in one hand.]\n:Conspiracy theorist: You didn't win the argument!\n:Cueball: ''...eeee!''\n:Cueball: ''Sploosh!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Conspiracy theory]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Cognitive Bias]]"
