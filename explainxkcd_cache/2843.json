[[Technically]], the exact phrase \"first, do no harm\" is not in the oath, but this meaning is implied.\n\nThe full Hippocratic Oath can be seen at {{w|Hippocratic Oath#Modern versions and relevance|the Wikipedia article}}.\n\nRandall takes other words that sound similar to \"Hippocratic\" and creates \"oaths\" for them.\n\n* {{wiktionary|Hyperbaric}} means \"of, relating to, or utilizing greater than normal pressure\", so thus a \"hyperbaric oath\" would indeed involve getting used to (acclimating to) a different pressure.\n* Holographic refers to \"holographic\" projections as seen in media such as ''{{w|Star Wars}}'', in which the image typically shimmers. Not to be confused with actual {{w|holograms}}.\n* {{wiktionary|Histrionics}} is \"exaggerated, overemotional behaviour, especially when calculated to elicit a response\".\n* {{w|Hydroelectricity}} is producing energy using water power, typically using {{w|turbine|turbines}}.\n* A {{w|hippodrome}} is an arena that was historically used for chariot racing and horse racing.\n* {{w|Hypnagogia}} is \"the state immediately before falling asleep\". The phenomenon of jolting awake just as one is about to fall asleep is sometimes referred to as a hypnagogic jerk or {{w|hypnic jerk}}. According to [[371: Compiler Complaint]], this is essentially the human equivalent to a segfault.\n* A {{w|hypergolic propellant}} is a type of rocket propellant which doesn't need a spark to ignite, and spontaneously combusts when mixing the parts together. Normal rocket propellant, such as RP-1 and liquid oxygen, requires some sort of initial spark to start the reaction.\n* (title text) {{w|Hermeneutics}} is the study of interpreting texts, thus the \"Hermeneutic Oath\" could have several interpretations as to its meaning.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[There are multiple panels showing different characters, with the name of an oath above them and \"First,\" followed by some principle related to the oath below them.
