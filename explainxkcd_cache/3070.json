The mountain range that [[Cueball]] and [[Ponytail]] are looking at was formed a billion years ago, but the mountains themselves have been eroded away and replaced. This could reference the {{w|Ship of Theseus}} thought experiment. Cueball analogizes this to a fully-renovated home, and Ponytail continues the analogy by jokingly pretending to use this as a real estate opportunity, offering it for sale to Cueball. She makes the sales pitch that this is good solid {{w|Intrusive rock|plutonic bedrock}}, freshly uplifted (from below the surface from the collision of the tectonic plates). Cueball plays along by saying he'd prefer 'new construction', and suggests a volcanic seamount, which Ponytail rejects on the basis of it being quite literally 'too hot' - covered in lava or soon to be so. This is a pun, as a 'hot' real estate market normally means that properties are selling quickly, usually leading to high prices that may be over-inflated.\n\nThe title text continues the joke, pointing out that most houses with heated floors have them only ''inside'', with the implication that a volcano's magma (underground) or lava (on the surface) can make a heated floor ''outside''. Orogeny was also mentioned in [[1082: Geology]]. This comic is reminiscent of the [[:Category:Home Inspections|Home Inspections]] series but, given that there is not yet a home to assess, it is not strictly part of that category. There was also the recent [[3051: Hardwood]], about defining underlying geology as part of a house, which might hint at Randall working all around a wider theme.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Ponytail are seen from afar standing together on hill and looking out at a mountain range with mountains going all the way to the horizon, with more than 20 peaks. The hills they are standing on is grassy and strewn with rocks.]\n:Cueball: I hear these mountains are a billion years old.\n:Ponytail: Well, sort of.\n\n:[Close up of Cueball and Ponytail on a white background. Ponytail holds her hand palm up out towards Cueball.]\n:Ponytail: An ancient collision created the mountain belt, but the actual rock layers have been continually uplifted and eroded away.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel Cueball takes his hand to his chin looking down, while Ponytail now gestures away from Cueball with her palm held out.]\n:Cueball: So it's an old mountain range, but it's been fully renovated?\n:Ponytail: Yessir, torn down to the roots. This is good solid plutonic bedrock, freshly uplifted. Great value.\n:Ponytail: You in the market?\n\n:[They are now just standing normally talking to each other.]\n:Cueball: I dunno, I was looking for new construction. You got any emerging volcanic seamounts?\n:Ponytail: Nah, that market is a little too hot right now.\n\n==Trivia==\nDespite being released on April 1st (in some time zones), it is not an [[April Fools' Day comics|April Fools' Day comic]]. It was still March 31st for Randall and is consistent with a normal Monday comic; the 2025 April Fools' Day comic was released on April 9.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Geology]]"
