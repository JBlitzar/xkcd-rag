This comic was a humorous take on how the then-upcoming sequel in the {{w|Star Wars franchise}} might have resolved issues from a previous film in that series.\n\n===Star Wars background===\nIn the first-produced movie of the series, ''{{w|Star Wars (film)|Star Wars:Episode IV: A New Hope}}'', {{w|Luke Skywalker}}'s uncle tells him to clean two newly purchased droids ({{w|R2-D2}} and {{w|C-3PO}}). Luke complains that he had plans to pick up some power converters at {{w|Tatooine#Settlements|Tosche Station}}. Luke is told to clean the droids first; however, while doing so, he discovers a message carried by R2-D2, starting him on a course of events that runs through the original trilogy. As a result, he never ultimately goes to Tosche Station.\n\nThe conversation between Luke and his uncle, {{w|Owen Lars}}, is as follows:\n:'''Uncle Owen:''' Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want ’em cleaned up before dinner.\n:'''Luke:''' But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!\n:'''Uncle Owen:''' You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it.\n\nLuke's line is one of many well-known lines from the series and is often-quoted as an example of how Luke is initially portrayed as a whiny teenager. By the end of the {{W|Return of the Jedi|''Episode VI:Return of the Jedi''}}, Luke has grown into a mature and powerful Jedi, completing his transformation through the original trilogy.\n\n====The Force Awakens====\n''{{w|Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens}}'' was, at the time of the comic's release, the upcoming seventh feature-length live-action film in the ''Star Wars'' series, and was the first since the rights to the franchise were sold by creator George Lucas to the Disney Company. It is a sequel to the original trilogy.\n\nSince creating the original trilogy, many of Lucas's decisions in respect of the franchise have been subject to fan criticism, including criticism of the quality of three prequel films Lucas produced beginning in 1999 (after a more than 15-year hiatus). The new seventh film was entrusted by Disney to producer/director J.J. Abrams, who in 2009 produced and directed the highly acclaimed (although still highly criticized by some fans) ''Star Trek'' reboot.\n\nGiven all of this context, the new ''Star Wars'' film was as highly anticipated, or more highly anticipated than the prequel trilogy, and had a strong buzz around it. Much of the early buzz surrounded the nature of the new film's plot: For example, whether it would be a prequel or a sequel, and whether it would feature any of the original cast/characters.\n\n{{w|J. J. Abrams}} and others involved in the filming ''{{w|Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens}}'' had appeared in a panel at San Diego Comic-Con the weekend prior to the comic's release to unveil details about the film. This is likely the impetus for the timing of this comic.\n\n===The Comic===\nThis comic portrays Randall's own conception of what the sequel might have been. In his version of the movie, Luke returns home to {{w|Tatooine}} years later with R2-D2 to finish the personal task that was interrupted by succesive chores, errands, tasks, trainings and missions that he had been required to undertake throughout the original film trilogy. Luke goes to Tosche Station and says \"I'm here for those power converters\", thus finally ready to start on his own long postponed hobby. The action is bookended by the opening and {{w|closing credits}}, suggesting this uneventful scene comprises the entire film.\n\nTherefore, the comic jokingly implies that getting the power converters was the most pressing of all the unresolved issues in the other films, and the most interesting upon which to base the sequel. In reality, this would likely be one of the least entertaining and most disappointing sequels that could possibly be made (perhaps second only to a version that had no reference to the previous films at all). \n\nRandall may have also been commenting that there are few if any unresolved issues in the Star Wars franchise that required revisiting and that the series should be left alone. Or he could have been making a joke about how sequels call back to elements of previous movies without fully considering the context. In this case, the power converters are possibly something he had planned to soup up his old X-34 landspeeder. But that was originally sold in Mos Eisley, to cover the costs of his original travel off-planet, so finally getting around to that tinkering would also require reaquiring either his old X-34 or some suitable replacement craft. Another possibility would be to ''finally'' fix his T-16 skyhopper (unseen, but which we know he had often flown; though having apparently damaged at some point prior to the start of A New Hope).\n\nThe title text alludes to another fantasy franchise, ''{{w|Lord of the Rings}}'', and how {{w|Samwise Gamgee}} was similarly interrupted from a menial task of gardening and listening in on conversations outside {{w|Bag End}} by {{w|Gandalf}} and his quest to save the world at the start of the first film. The title text uses the term “dropping eaves” as Samwise did in his denial of eavesdropping on the conversation between Frodo and Gandalf. In both cases, the issue of collecting power converters and Sam’s gardening duties were left unresolved in their respective stories and the main plot of the series is thoroughly concluded.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black background with white letters in the style of the Star Wars logo with the subtitle in between the two words.]\n:'''Star'''\n:The Force Awakens\n:'''Wars'''\n\n:[Building in the desert, two persons are seen in the background, and Cueball is running in front of the building.
