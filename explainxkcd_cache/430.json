The title of the strip suggest that this is a regular occurrence: he wakes up with vivid memories of elaborate and fascinating dreamscapes, but is unable to tell anyone about it, because the memories fade so quickly, he's lost almost everything before he gets the chance. \n   \nThe title text is a reference to {{w|C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis's}} novel ''{{w|The Voyage of the Dawn Treader}}'', in which Lucy Pevensie reads a story that “refreshes her spirit” – “That is the loveliest story I’ve ever read or ever shall read in my whole life. Oh, I wish I could have gone on reading it for ten years.” – but afterwards can only remember that it had something to do with [https://archive.org/details/voyageofdawntr00lewi_0/page/132 \"a cup and a sword and a tree and a green hill.\"]\n\nAn effort to remember dreams was made in [[269: TCMP]].\n\n==Transcript==\n\n\n:[In the background, a vivid dream scene is apparent, including mountains, a city with a mushroom cloud, a zeppelin where one person has knocked another off, another person climbing on or off the blimp on a rope, another blimp anchoring to a city in the background, one Cueball and Megan holding hands, one Cueball looking at the person on the rope, one Cueball and Megan sword fighting over a cup of spilled liquid, another set looking at a laptop, another set hugging, another set sliding down a separate rope from the blimp and a last set falling. In the far right there is a third blimp flying over a mountain range. All in all, this seems very much like an apocalypse and not something one would forget easily. In the inset, Cueball awakens, very surprised.]\n:Cueball: !!!\n\n:[Dream's edges are fading, mountains, city, and zeppelin less clear. In the inset, Cueball is seen running down stairs.]\n\n:[Zeppelin, city, and mountains are very hazy and unclear. The people can still be seen. In the inset, Cueball gets the attention of Megan, who is sitting at a breakfast table.]\n\n:[The dream has completely faded, only the outlines of three people can still be seen. In the inset, Cueball looks confused.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Dreams]]\n[[Category:Airships]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
