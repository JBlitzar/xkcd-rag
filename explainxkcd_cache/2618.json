She uses this as part of her presentation, concluding that most people are therefore aware of what selection bias is.\n\n{{w|Selection bias}} is when a survey or poll of some sort comes up with incorrect results due to those who were asked. For example, if you asked a group of people how many acres of land they own, your average number will be higher if you ask a group of farmers rather than a group of city residents.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe joke is that she is thus falling for the very thing she's trying to explain. A statistics conference is likely to have an audience consisting of professional statisticians, or at least people interested in the subject, and it is expected that most of them would thus be familiar with any mainstream statistical term, like selection bias. Had she asked a random sample of people in the street, many of them would likely not be sure what selection bias is. This effect is also the subject of [[2357: Polls vs the Street]].\n\nThis joke also ties into how statistics as a whole can be highly counter-intuitive and sometimes almost paradoxical, where things like the {{w|Monty Hall problem}} and {{w|survivorship bias}} lead people into thinking the answer to a problem is definitely in a place it's not. That Blondie, presumably a statistician herself, made this kind of (potentially deliberate) error is professionally embarrassing but not unprecedented.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Acquiescence bias}}, which is the tendency of people to respond positively to positive questions, for example, \"Are you familiar with the famous webcomic {{xkcd}}?\" is more likely to generate the answer yes than \"Are you familiar with that webcomic for engineers that nobody else understands until they go to [[Main_Page|Explain xkcd]]?\" Acquiescence bias is not a widely known concept,{{citation needed}} making the results of this poll suspect; similar to the selection bias example above, the reason that the general public seems familiar with acquiescence bias may be because the surveyor themself fell victim to promoting acquiescence bias.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Blondie is standing on a podium behind a lectern with a microphone. She is standing under a hanging sign with large text. In front of the podium is an audience of five seated persons all with their hands raised above their heads. The audience includes two guys that look like Cueball, Hairbun, and two other persons with dark and blonde hair.]\n:Sign: Statistics Conference 2022\n:Blondie: Raise your hand if you’re familiar with selection bias. \n:Blondie: As you can see, it’s a term most people know... \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Blondie]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Cognitive Bias]]"
