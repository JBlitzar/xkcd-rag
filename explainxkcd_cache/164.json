More than 97% of scientists are sure that it's caused by an increase in greenhouse gases caused by humanity's industrialization and activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.{{Actual citation needed}} Losses of human food security and habitat; melting of glaciers leading to a rise in sea temperatures; and more frequent heat waves, droughts, and species extinctions are just some of the many effects of global warming.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\nYet, despite the unequivocal nature of {{rw|climate_change|climate change}}, it's a hot-button political topic in the United States, with many {{rw|conservatives}} denying its existence, arguing that it has natural causes, or claiming that global warming could be a good thing. Liberals counter by saying that conservatives are claiming these things because they're in bed with the oil companies, and by denying the existence of global warming, they're saved from having to do anything about it. It's such a controversial topic in the U.S. that, in this comic, [[Cueball]] says he's decided to keep his mouth shut about the whole thing. He has withdrawn from the debate because it doesn't ''matter'' if he wins the debate or not — science doesn't care about who got the last word. If humanity reaches the tipping point and one day can't do anything to stop global warming, Cueball will find it interesting to watch exactly what happens. And if it turns out that the scientists are wrong, he won't feel embarrassed that he's been making a big deal about it this whole time.\n\nIn the title text, he touches on the political side of global warming, saying that there are many well-meaning conservatives out here who honestly believe that global warming doesn't happen, and that liberals only bring it up to have a moral issue to attack conservatives with.\n\nThis was the first direct reference to global warming in xkcd, but since then, climate change, with an emphasis on global warming, has become a [[:Category:Climate change|recurring theme]] in xkcd. Seems Randall would no longer like to be on this ride, especially with the comic [[1732: Earth Temperature Timeline]] released almost 10 years after this one.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing under a large amount of text said in one go.]\n:Cueball: Yes, from the evidence it looks pretty likely to me that we're causing global warming on a horrific scale. But with science you don't need to argue. It doesn't matter who wins the debate — it's about reality. By just waiting a little longer, we'll get to <u>see</u> who was right. It feels unethical but I find myself wanting to keep quiet about the science just to know for sure. As terrible as it sounds, the state of the world isn't really my responsibility. I'm just thrilled to get to watch. If the scientists are right — and if we keep people from understanding just a little longer — we'll enjoy quite a ride. And pragmatically, on the outside chance that they're all wrong, I get saved the embarrassment of having spoken up.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]"
