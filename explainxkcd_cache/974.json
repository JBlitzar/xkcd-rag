Usually it is expected that the person will simply pass the salt immediately; however, the offscreen person doesn't get back to him until 20 minutes later, when Cueball repeats his request. The friend explains that they're attempting to solve the general problem of passing ''any'' table condiment (which salt is not; in culinary terms, it is a seasoning. Condiments are liquid-based complements, such as ketchups, mustards, relishes & chutneys), not just salt.\n\nThis is a common mistake made in software development, wherein a developer tries to solve a problem far more general than the specific one they have been tasked to solve.{{Citation needed}} Sometimes, this foresight can be useful, if the developer has predicted use cases that later turn out to be needed; other times, it can lead to wasted time, or worse, overengineering, where a system is made more complex and fragile than it needed to be, instead of robustly solving a single, well-defined problem.\n\nIt isn't clear what exactly the offscreen friend is doing (or even what they ''could'' do) to solve the general condiment-passing problem; most likely they are still in the design stage of their solution and have not even started implementing it, much to Cueball's chagrin. Nonetheless they are convinced that it is worth taking the time to do this now due to the potential time-saving in the long run. In doing so, they are overlooking the more salient and saline facts of the situation; namely, that passing condiments is not something that requires a solution or takes up any significant amount of time, and that Cueball would probably prefer to have the salt while his meal is still warm.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] notes a social paradox: that people tend to be disparaging of such inefficient time-wasting while it's not producing any results, but will heap praise on it when they're able to reap the benefits of that foresight.\n\nSee also [[137: Dreams]], [[1205: Is It Worth the Time?]], [[1319: Automation]], [[1691: Optimization]], [[2752: Salt Dome]] and the [[:Category:Time_management|Time management category]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a table, eating a meal.]\n:Cueball: Can you pass the salt?\n\n:[Cueball pauses, a bite of food on his fork, silently.]\n\n:[Cueball still has fork in mid-air.]\n:Cueball: I said-\n:Off-screen person: I know!
