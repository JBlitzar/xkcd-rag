Can we try cycling day and night really fast?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic makes reference to the idea, as presented in the movie ''{{w|The Matrix}}'', that reality is a computer simulation. In {{w|Liquid-crystal display|LCD screens}}, especially {{w|TFT LCD}}, a {{w|Defective pixel|dead pixel}} is a pixel that does not work properly, usually set as black or as some other color. Megan realizes that the reality is a computer simulation when she sees dead pixels in the sky, indicating that what she sees is an LCD screen.\n\nIn the last panel of the comic, there are two red and one green pixel that look exactly like actual dead pixels.\n\nThe title text refers to usual techniques for fixing a dead pixel. One way is to apply pressure and release it, which isn't possible for Megan due to the distance of the sky. Another way is to make the area of the screen that the dead pixel is on change colors really quickly, which could happen if the day-night cycle was fast enough.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is standing to one side.]\n:We've all seen ''The Matrix''\n:We've all joked about \"What resolution is life?\"\n:But it doesn't blunt the shock\n:Of waking up one morning\n:[Megan looks up from field and sees several colored pixels in the sky.]\n:And seeing dead pixels in the sky.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:The Matrix]]"
