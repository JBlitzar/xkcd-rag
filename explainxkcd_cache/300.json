With everyone placing their personal interests on their {{w|Facebook}} profile pages, it has become fairly easy to gather a lot of information about people. In the comic, [[Cueball]] uses this information to his advantage: He ascertained [[Megan|Megan's]] musical preferences beforehand in order to create the illusion of their sharing mutual interests. Megan is led to believe that he is {{w|soulmate|like-minded}}, thus making it easier for Cueball to persuade her into having sex with him. Here the comic takes at the fact that many people use Facebook as a hunting ground for sexual contacts.\n\nApparently, Megan did not only mention her favorite bands in her profile, but also her preferred {{w|sex position}}. This can be read as a sideswipe at what intimate details some people are willing to share on the internet. Although mentioning sexual preferences is hyperbolic here.\n\nMegan's taste in both fields can be regarded as outside the mainstream.  {{w|Regina Spektor}} and {{w|The Polyphonic Spree}} are representatives of the {{w|indie pop}} genre. The [http://www.menshealth.com/sex-position-playbook/wheelbarrow-standing ''Wheelbarrow''] ({{w|NSFW}}) features the man standing behind the woman and holding her legs, while she props up in a wheelbarrow-like position. The retrograde variant has the woman facing upwards. Unusual sex positions are also mentioned in comics [[414: Mistranslations]] and [[487: Numerical Sex Positions]].\n\nThe title text suggests that Cueball did not stop at reading Megan's interests on her Facebook profile, but also obtained her phone number and placed it in his phone. It is implied that some of the \"mildly sleazy\" uses of Facebook can border on the verge of {{w|stalking}}. When Megan discovers the number, she may realize this and stay clear of Cueball...\n\n==Transcript==\n:Mildly sleazy uses of Facebook, part 14:\n:Looking up someone's profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention\n:Cueball: Favorite bands? Hmm...\n:Cueball: Maybe Regina Spektor or the Polyphonic Spree.\n:Megan: Whoa, those are two of my favorites, too!\n:Megan: Clearly, we should have sex.\n:Cueball: Okay! My favorite position is the retrograde wheelbarrow.\n:[Megan raises arms.]\n:Megan: Ohmygod, mine too!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
