The title text of that former comic specifically refers to sending out a \"BUN ALERT\" to friends and family with location and photographic evidence of the bun, so in this comic, that concept appears to have been elevated from a simple mass SMS/MMS message to a standalone application.\n\nUpon seeing the bun, Beret Guy uses his phone to send an alert about the \"Bun\" with a [[wikipedia:Push technology|push notification]]. He is still looking for investors, though such an app would likely not appeal to a wide market.{{Citation needed}} In response to [[Ponytail]]'s confusion, he explains that bunnies are \"like loaves of bread that hop\" making a pun by comparing rabbits to bread, as \"bun\" can commonly refer to a small loaf of bread. Beret Guy is known to be fascinated with bakeries, as shown in the comics [[434: xkcd Goes to the Airport]], [[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel ]], or [[452: Mission]], so it makes sense that this sort of comparison occurs to him. It is known that the word \"bun\" is similar to the word \"pun\". Beret Guy has a history of misinterpreting statements and phrases (and often making said misinterpretations correct through some strange power of his), so it is not implausible that he actually genuinely thinks that these \"buns\" are bread products that somehow behave exactly like rabbits.\n\nAs Ponytail leaves, apparently to remove herself from the situation, [[Megan]] hurriedly approaches, excited to see the \"bun\". This serves as a punchline as, despite Ponytail appearing to be the voice of reason, it seems that Beret Guy's inane bun alert system has gathered a dedicated following after all.\n\nMegan's question \"Is it small?\" and her amazement when she finds out that it is parallels the idea in [[1682: Bun]] where the bun's size is said to be inversely correlated with its status; smaller buns such as the one in this comic are thought of as higher-ranking \"king buns\" by the characters in both strips. In real life, smaller rabbits are more likely to simply be young. It is also possible that she simply thinks smaller buns are cuter, which might have been the motivation for the whole bun-ranking system thing in the first place.\n\nThe title text refers to buns being {{w|crepuscular}} and {{w|nocturnal}} animals, meaning they are primarily active at twilight and night, respectively. This means that someone with the app would get a lot of notifications while they would most likely be asleep. Many smartphones have a \"Do Not Disturb\" mode that can be activated so that only select communications (i.e. direct calls) will actually set off the ringer/vibration, and all others will simply be added to the device's notification queue; such a function can be scheduled to automatically activate during the period when the user is asleep. The title text unironically points out a prime example of the need for such a function: if something is likely to notify your device late at night, then you should make sure that those notifications are silenced by the Do Not Disturb function.\n\nThe bun alert reappears in [[1903: Bun Trend]], where Beret Guy receives the alert.\n\nAfter this comic was posted, someone has created a [https://bunalert.app Bun Alert website and app]. It does exactly what Randall's portrayed Bun Alert app describes.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy and Ponytail see a rabbit sitting in the grass; Beret Guy points to the bun.]\n:Beret Guy: Bun alert!\n:Ponytail: Oh, yeah! Cute!\n:Beret Guy: Gotta document this. I'll notify everyone, send out a push alert.\n:Ponytail: ...to who?\n\n:[Zoom in on Beret Guy and Ponytail; Beret Guy taps on his phone.]\n:Beret Guy: Everyone subscribed to the alert system.\n:Ponytail: Alert system?\n:Beret Guy: Yeah! We built it over the last few years. It's pretty small. Still looking for investors.\n:Ponytail: But...''why'' are you alerting people about rabbits?\n\n:[Zoom out; Beret Guy puts away his phone, points at the bun.]\n:Beret Guy: I mean...look at them. They're like loaves of bread that hop.\n:Ponytail: I see.\n:Beret Guy: ''People need to know.''\n\n:[Zoom on Beret Guy in a frameless panel.]\n:Beret Guy: They need to know:\n:Beret Guy: '''''There are buns.'''''\n\n:[Ponytail walks off, Megan comes running towards Beret Guy with a phone in her hand.]\n:Ponytail: Okay, uhh, I'm gonna go.\n:Megan: ''I got the alert!'' Where's the bun? '''''Is it small?'''''\n:Beret Guy: ''Extremely.''\n:Megan: Oh my God.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In [[1682: Bun]], it was Ponytail who was infatuated with \"buns\", while Megan was the incredulous one questioning the situation. In this comic, the roles are reversed. This is a strong indication that the characters represented by Ponytail and Megan in this comic are not the same characters from ''1682: Bun''.\n\n*On August 6th, 2017 a [http://jgreenemi.com/bun-alert-an-afternoon-xkcd-project/ real-world Bun Alert] was created by a developer following inspiration from [[1871: Bun Alert]]. The project was shut down by the developer on January 29th, 2018 and no longer sends out alerts, although [https://bunalert.jgreenemi.com/ the webpage] is still accessible.\n\n*On August 8th, 2017 an Android app was created by a developer also following inspiration from [[1871: Bun Alert]]\n\n*On October 5th, 2020 an update to the Android app, along with an iOS app was published. The website is available [https://bunalert.app/ here].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Beret Guy's Business]]\n[[Category:Buns]]"
