Both are now built and are located in Chile. The {{w|Overwhelmingly Large Telescope}} was another proposed telescope that, as the comic mentions, was cancelled. The comic pokes fun at the generic nature of the names of the telescopes by proposing more generic but increasingly ridiculous names for future telescopes. It mocks the fact that, while scientists usually use very precise terminology, the names for these telescopes are anything but.\n\nThe title text talks about the {{w|Thirty Meter Telescope}}, which is about to begin construction on {{w|Mauna Kea}} (a dormant volcano) in Hawaii, and seems to compare it to the {{w|Sauron#Eye of Sauron|Eye of Sauron}}. It is expected to be the most advanced and powerful optical telescope on Earth when completed.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A list of telescope names is given, with a series of checkboxes at right.]\n:{|\n|align=\"right\"|The Very Large Telescope||☑\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Extremely Large Telescope||☑\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope||☑ (Canceled)\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Oppressively Colossal Telescope||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Mind-numbingly Vast Telescope||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Despair Telescope||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Cataclysmic Telescope||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Telescope of Devastation||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Nightmare Scope||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Infinite Telescope||☐\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|The Final Telescope||☐\n|}\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Telescopes]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes]] <!--Title text -->"
