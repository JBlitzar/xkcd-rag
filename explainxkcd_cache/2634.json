However reasons for “insecure” https are often benign:\n\n* The certificates expired, and the site maintainers have not asked for new certificates.\n* The certificates are self-signed by the owners.\n* The client has an outdated list of CA certificates.\n\nA comprehensive list of reasons associated with server misconfigurations can be found on [https://badssl.com/ badssl].\n\nAlthough a lack of the https protocol in a web process does allow for third party tampering and deception, it also implies that the site is rather old; and, if it has been maintained for this long, it is probably not malicious, as most malicious sites are either reported and taken down or allowed to become defunct by their operators after a short amount of time.\n\nThe title text essentially explains the joke, noting that maintaining a website costs money and that there are regulatory agencies responsible for taking down sketchy domains, and so if a website is still up despite these obstacles, it is probably trustworthy.\n\nA similar question was asked on [[1256: Questions]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat is sitting in an office chair at his desk facing his laptop while Cueball is standing behind him looking over his shoulder.]\n:White Hat: What does the red line through https mean?\n:Cueball: Oh, just that the site hasn't been updated since 2015 or so.\n:Cueball: And since it's been around that long it means it's probably legit.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computer security]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"
