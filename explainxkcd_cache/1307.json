This method of writing headlines, referred to as {{w|clickbait}}, is used by several other news sites, because it is known to generate a lot of visits and therefore more ad revenue. [[Randall]] has touched on this subject before, in [[1283: Headlines]].\n\nCarolers are usually rewarded with a gift, but the BuzzFeed writers probably didn't appreciate the song, because they threw \"weird stuff\" (probably office supplies) at them.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four carolers (Megan, Cueball, Ponytail and Hairy) are singing.]\n:12 Best drummers of ''all time''\n:11 Pipers whose jaw-dropping good piping will make you cry\n:You won't ''believe'' what these 10 lords leap over\n:[Caption below the frame]\n:Carolers outside the Buzzfeed offices perform \"12 Weird things I ''actually got'' for Christmas\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Buzzfeed YouTube Channel uploaded a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v92edGrMbY video] called ''The 12 Days of Internet Christmas'', which is similar to ''The Twelve Days of Christmas'' song. But the video contains a number of strange objects and images, to name a few, a naked Ryan Gosling and four men with curly beards. Because of its absurd content, according to the like-dislike ratio, the video's quality is rather controversial.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Christmas]]\n[[Category:Clickbait]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]"
