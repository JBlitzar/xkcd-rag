Tags will typically describe the content and genre of the song, and many music organization programs and services will allow users to find all songs that contain a particular tag; so when a user searches for \"Country breakup music,\" they will receive a list of {{w|Country music|country}} songs about breaking up.\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] tests [[Megan]]'s claim that she can make a song name for any set of tags by coming up with a collection of mostly unrelated words: \"{{w|lesbian}} {{w|voyeurism}} {{w|one-hit wonder}} {{w|Mashup (music)|mash-up|}}.\" A {{w|lesbian}} is a woman who is only sexually interested in other women. {{w|Voyeurism}} is the act of watching someone else do something sexual, generally without their knowledge. A {{w|one-hit wonder}} is a band that had \"one big hit\" before fading from the public eye forever. A {{w|Mashup (music)|mash-up}} is when someone takes two previously unrelated songs and makes a third song that's a mix of both of them (a recent example of which would be [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82LCKBdjywQ this Gangam Style/Ghostbusters theme mashup]). In response, Megan immediately replies with one song title that looks like it would fit the tags well. When Cueball asks for a second example, Megan gives him a new example for the same set of tags, which is really impressive.\n\nMegan's first title, \"I Wish That Stacy's Mom Had Jessie's Girl\" is a ''mash-up'' of {{w|Jessie's Girl|\"Jessie's Girl\"}} by {{w|Rick Springfield}} (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs video] on YouTube), and {{w|Stacy's Mom|\"Stacy's Mom\"}} by {{w|Fountains of Wayne}} (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4 video] on YouTube), the latter was a ''one-hit-wonder'', whereas Springfield has had several other hits. (The song Stacy's Mom was referenced in comic [[61: Stacey's Dad]]). \n\nThe second title, \"When You Come on Eileen I Touch Myself\" is a ''mash-up'' of {{w|Come On Eileen|\"Come on Eileen\"}} by {{w|Dexys Midnight Runners}} (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVxcwe7EcaY video] on YouTube), and {{w|I Touch Myself|\"I Touch Myself\"}} by {{w|Divinyls}} (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv-34w8kGPM video] on YouTube). Both of these are one-hit wonders (at least in the US; Dexys had more hits in the UK). Note that \"Come on, Eileen\" means \"Hurry up, Eileen\", and that \"to come on someone\" means to ejaculate on someone. Since the song is about lesbian sex, come on someone must mean have an orgasm while being on someone.\n\nFor other random connections see [[305: Rule 34]].\n\n===Title text===\nThe title text is a set of potential lyrics to Megan's second title. [[Randall]] borrowed the rhyme scheme, phrasing, and subject matter from the first eight {{w|stanzas}} of \"I Touch Myself\" with additional subject matter inspired by \"Come on Eileen.\" The final stanza is the chorus lead-in from the latter.\n\nThe lyrics suggest a changed relationship between the characters. In the original \"I Touch Myself\", the female singer touches herself (masturbates) when thinking about her lover (of unspecified gender); instead, she now does this while a new third character makes love to her beloved, Eileen, while the singer overhears them (as a voyeur) from the apartment above.\n\nHere are the lyrics for [http://www.metrolyrics.com/i-touch-myself-lyrics-the-divinyls.html I Touch Myself] and [http://www.metrolyrics.com/come-on-eileen-lyrics-dexys-midnight-runners.html Come on Eileen]. Below in the table the mashed up lines are shown. As can be seen most of the text is from \"I Touch Myself\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Mashed up line\n! Line from \"I Touch Myself\"\n! Line from \"Come On Eileen\"\n|-\n| I love Eileen\n| '''I love''' myself (1st line).\n| Come on '''Eileen''' (1st line).\n|-\n| and want you to love her\n| I '''want you to love''' me (2nd part of 1st line).\n| No line - the '''her''' is now referring to Eileen.\n|-\n| When you're around\n| '''When you're around''' (11th line).\n| No line.\n|-\n| I'm one floor above her\n| '''I''' want you '''above''' me (2nd line).\n| No line - the '''her''' is now referring to Eileen.\n|-\n| If you could see\n| A fool '''could see''' (15th line).\n| No line.\n|-\n| just how much I adore her\n| '''just how much I adore''' you (2nd part of previous line).\n| No line - the '''her''' is now referring to Eileen.\n|-\n| Oh, that pretty red dress\n| There are many '''Oh''' in this song, but also in the other.\n| '''That pretty red dress''' (30th line).\n|-\n| I'd do anything for her\n| '''I'd do anything for''' you (16th line).\n| No line - the '''her''' is now referring to Eileen.\n|-\n| (Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy)\n| No line.\n| '''(Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy)''' (11th line).\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: So you can come up with a song title fitting any tag combination?\n:Megan: Try me.\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: Lesbian voyeurism one-hit wonder mash-up.\n:Megan: \"I wish that Stacey's Mom had Jessie's Girl.\"\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are just standing there for a beat panel.]\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: Well, that was one, but-\n:Megan: \"When you Come On Eileen I touch myself.\"\n:Cueball: Okay, wow.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nBoth song names that Megan produces are in {{w|iambic pentameter}}, suggesting that Megan's hobby has the flavor of Cueball's in [[79: Iambic Pentameter]].\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Homosexuality]]"
