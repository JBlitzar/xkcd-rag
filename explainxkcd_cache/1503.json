The squirrels' understanding of astrophysics is lacking, regarding the distance to the Sun and appropriate transportation to reach it in addition to the need to resist the sun's heat and exist in the vacuum of space. Their belief that the Sun is made of acorns reflects their uniquely acorn-focused worldview, a reference to the tendency of real-life squirrels to gather and store acorns as winter food, as well as their single-minded dedication to overcoming obstacles (even [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg elaborately-constructed obstacle courses]) for the sake of obtaining nuts.\n\nThe title text reveals that \"halfway to the Sun,\" 75 million kilometers from all known acorns in our universe, the airborne squirrel seems to jeopardize the entire mission because he wants to test if the balloon itself is full of acorns. Basic observational skills will tell anyone that acorns are not lighter than air, but the idea follows the logic stated by the squirrels:  If the Sun, being so magnificent, must be full of acorns, then a balloon powerful enough to take a squirrel to the Sun must also be powered by something amazing, like acorns. Obviously, neither the Sun or balloons are filled with acorns.{{Citation needed}} That we know of..... Maybe those squirrels were onto something.\n\nUsage of balloons for space travel is a prominent motif in early science fiction; see, for example, \"{{w|The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall}}\" by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[There are three squirrels.  One is suspended from a balloon. The other two are sitting on the ground, looking up at it.]\n\n:Squirrel to the right: Once you've chewed a hole in the Sun, shoot the balloon to fall back to earth, then pull the parachute ripcord to land.\n\n:Squirrel tied to balloon: Are you '''''sure''''' it's full of acorns?\n\n:Squirrel to the right: Look how bright and magnificent it is! What ''else'' could be in there?\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is commonly believed that real squirrels use their ''tails'' as parachutes, although as yet [http://io9.com/5946627/squirrel-hurls-itself-through-a-fourth-story-window-scampers-off-unscathed \"there have been no observational studies on the aerodynamics of free-falling squirrels.\"]\n*In the real world [http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=1020.0 helium balloons cannot escape the stratosphere.]  Perhaps the squirrel only ''thinks'' he's halfway to the Sun. Or maybe the acorns in the balloon are pushing on the [[1404:_Quantum_Vacuum_Virtual_Plasma|quantum vacuum virtual plasma]].\n*The \"shooting a hole in the balloon\" is based on Larry Walters, who actually flew in a lawn chair suspended below a large cluster of helium balloons, using a pellet gun to shoot out balloons to descend.
