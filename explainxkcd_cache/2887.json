Hairy asks if anyone has any other concerns, a common enough question to ask when trying to ensure that nobody at the meeting has still something to say that had not already been covered directly by the agenda or the resulting discussions.\n\nCueball voices an opinion on Minnesota. Due to the {{w|post-glacial rebound}} present in Minnesota, this US state is apparently slowly decreasing in size. The humor comes from the fact that this may be a genuine concern to Cueball, but is completely unrelated to the topic of the meeting, is not really a 'problem' that has any practical significance, and in any case there is also no reasonable way to prevent this.{{Citation needed}} And yet Cueball clearly finds it important enough that \"all meetings should be about Minnesota\" until the 'problem' is solved.\n\nThe title text implies that Cueball has also brought this issue up to the {{w|National Geodetic Survey}}; rather than commenting on his data or findings, they have simply requested that he stop using suggestive language in his papers. (\"Supple\" and \"squishy\" are sometimes used, especially in erotic literature, to describe certain body parts.)<sup>[<i>citation greatly appreciated</i>]</sup>\n\nThe Midwestern states, particularly in areas like the {{w|New Madrid Seismic Zone}}, are subject to the movement of tectonic plates well within a tectonic plate boundary. While these areas are typically less active than boundary zones, they can still experience significant seismic activity. The flexible way the Earth's crust in these regions responds to tectonic stresses – gently stretching and flexing over centuries in response to deep stresses – could imaginatively be described as \"supple.\"\n\nMinnesota's northern border is legally defined in part by reference to geographical features, most notably {{w|Lake of the Woods}} and a chain of rivers and lakes connecting it to {{w|Lake Superior}}. As such, movement of these features due to glacial rebound may indeed be reducing Minnesota's size at a very gradual rate. Minnesota's southern border, in contrast, is legally defined as a line running at 43º 30′ N, which would not be affected by the motion of the land. Indeed, it is possible that glacial rebound is effectively moving land out of Minnesota and into Iowa, again at a very gradual rate.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairy standing in front of Ponytail and Cueball, who are sitting behind a desk]\n:Hairy: Does anyone have any other concerns?\n:Cueball: I'm concerned that Minnesota is getting shorter.\n\n:[A map of Minnesota beside Cueball, with arrows pointing from the northern and southern borders toward the middle]\n:Cueball: Because of post-glacial crust rebound, the northern border is moving toward the southern border. It's less than an inch a decade, but I still don't like it.\n:Cueball: Minnesota shouldn't be squishy.\n\n:[Hairy again standing in front of Ponytail and Cueball at the desk. Ponytail is looking at Cueball, whose finger is now raised in the air, gesturing]\n:Hairy: Okay. Does anyone have any concerns related to the topic of this meeting?\n:Cueball: All meetings should be about Minnesota until we resolve this.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Geography]]"
