    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 229\n| date      = February 28, 2007\n| title     = Graffiti\n| image     = graffiti.png\n| titletext = FOR AN INTRIGUING TIME CALL\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe humor in this comic comes from the irony of a deep philosophical musing on the nature of individuals sharing a private space in a public place, unknown to one another and separated by time. The graffiti text is juxtaposed with more common bathroom stall scrawlings - insults, slurs, and \"[Name] was here.\"\n\nThis comic makes use of the existential idea of \"finding meaning where you look for it,\" a recurring theme in xkcd. The caption implies that a bathroom stall isn't a place where Randall would like to find meaning in life, so he shouldn't look for it there.\n\nThe title text parodies one of the archetypical pieces of graffiti: \"For a good time, call [phone number],\" which indicates that the person reachable at that number is available for prostitution, casual sex, and/or phone sex. However, 'good' has been replaced with 'intriguing,' implying that instead of sex, the writer is offering witty and insightful conversation.\n\nThere may be a reference to this comic in [[1810: Chat Systems]] with the chat system called ''Wall (bathroom)''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits on a toilet in a bathroom. The stall sidewall next to him is covered in graffiti: \"you suck,\" \"Mike sucks cock,\" \"CUNT,\" \"fuck,\" \"BITCHAS,\" \"dane was here\" struck through and \"dane is a fag\" written under it, a crude pictogram of a penis, and various other unreadable scribbles.]\n:[One block of graffiti is salient:]\n::This graffiti is\n::fleeting human contact\n::both of us lost,\n::but for a moment\n::we're lost together.\n::I wonder who you are.\n\n:[Caption below the panel]:\n:I think I look for meaning in the wrong places sometimes.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
