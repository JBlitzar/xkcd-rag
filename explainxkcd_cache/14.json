Before the digital age, it allowed authors and publishers an opportunity to profit from their work without fear of someone making copies and selling them for their gain. In the digital age, when the cost and difficulty of copying has been reduced to near zero, it hasn't worked so well, especially for publishers of music and video. Via the idea of {{w|digital copyright}}, industry trade organizations like the {{w|RIAA}} and {{w|MPAA}} fought to preserve their old business models, lobbying for new laws to protect their income streams in an age where anyone can copy an {{w|MP3}} file or a DVD quickly and cheaply.\n\nThis has involved ordering web sites to take down \"infringing\" material (and many times material that wasn't infringing), media campaigns comparing file copiers to folks who commit murder on the high seas, and suing artists and writers who have used samples of music or movies in their own work. The {{w|RIAA}} has claimed that rampant illegal copying hurts the artists whose work is copied, as it cuts into the artists' royalty payments; many artists, on the other hand, complain that the RIAA's accounting practices have denied them their fair royalties for decades anyway, and that increased copying leads to increased fans and money through direct sales and is actually better for them than the RIAA. It's a vicious war. An early casualty in the copyright wars was {{w|Napster}}; a later casualty was the concept of {{w|DRM}} (Digital Rights Management) on recorded music and/or elsewhere. The wars have been going on since the early 1990s and essentially ended with the advent of streaming service royalties (Apple Music, Pandora, etc.).\n\nIn the title text, Randall mentions [https://slashdot.com Slashdot] and [https://boingboing.net Boing Boing], two news aggregation websites that, among other things, cover the copyright wars in detail.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A colored drawing of a hilly, grassy landscape.
