Again, this is a comic related to social interactions and especially displaying that Cueball/Randall has problems coping with simple social norms.\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] is talking with [[White Hat]]. Cueball has lost his original train of thought during a conversation, so he keeps using qualifiers until he comes up with something to say. Here he has used more than a dozen common qualifiers, including \"OK\", \"so\", \"listen\", \"like\", and \"but\". The title text says that after 20 minutes he says \"hi\", a reversal of expectations and a comedic play on how there was a huge buildup to something insignificant. He simply couldn't think of something new to say, and \"hi\" was the best he could come up with. [[White Hat]] presumably kept listening, although normal people would stop Cueball well before this.{{Citation needed}}\n\nWhile this scenario has probably happened to many people some time in their life, it is highly unlikely that one would keep on for such an extensive amount of time. It is also highly unlikely that the listener would have such patience to keep listening to this endless stream of qualifiers, although it actually fits in White Hat's unusual mentality.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing next to White Hat.]\n:Cueball: Ok, so, listen, the thing is, well, like, I'm just saying, and maybe it's just me, but, I mean, here's the thing, I could be way off here, but, look, I gotta say,\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:When I forget what I was going to say, I just keep prefixing qualifiers until I think of something new.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
