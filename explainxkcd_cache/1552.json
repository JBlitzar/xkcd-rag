In the film, a {{w|golden retriever}} becomes the star player on a {{w|basketball}} team. The obvious objection to an animal playing on human team is raised, but is handwaved by the referee responding \"ain't no rule says a dog can't play basketball.\" \n\nIn organized sports, the rulebook is generally considered to be the final arbiter of decisions, but the interpretation that anything not explicitly considered in the rulebook is allowed is shaky at best. It's impossible for a rulebook to detail every possible scenario that someone could attempt, and certain basic assumptions about gameplay need to be made. [[Ponytail]] highlights this by pointing out that there's also not an explicit rule against killing and eating an opposing player. With human players, this would be covered by laws against murder and cannibalism, but dogs don't enjoy the same level of legal protection (there may be animal cruelty laws, but those are likely to be far less punitive).\n\nThe title text  does acknowledge that killing and eating an opposing player is likely covered under the rules concerning {{w|technical foul|fouls}}, but the benefit of committing the foul (the star player being dead) would be worth the resulting penalty (giving the other team a couple of free throws). This likely pokes fun at the common practice of intentional fouls. It's not uncommon for players to commit fouls intentionally, having calculated that they'll gain some advantage (such as breaking the momentum of a play) which is worth the penalties they'll incur. \n\nRandall previously parodied the \"animal-as-player\" loophole in [[115: Meerkat]]. Rule books are also mentioned in [[330: Indecision]], [[393: Ultimate Game]], and [[1593: Play-By-Play]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are standing with a dog wearing jersey number 9, Ponytail and Hairy are facing them holding a rulebook. The horizon is visible behind them.]\n:Ponytail: There's nothing in the rulebook that says we can't kill and eat your dog.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]"
