The phone goes as far as to change a certain complaint to a scripted customer testimonial, complete with a hyperlink to an ordering site. This is continued in the title text, which presumably contains several flattering compliments about the great developers and the company.   \n\n\"It's taking the words I type and leaving them exactly the same\", \"I mean the words are correct\" and \"some of my posts look normal\" are definitely something one would not normally say. However, the auto-correct features of cell phones are so notorious for mangling people's posts, that one might express astonishment at a phone which did not change one's meaning. The rest of the thread does not support this interpretation.\n\nThe posts also make sense when being read in the reverse order. The comic may have been inspired by a [https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-messages-app-randomly-sending-pictures-some-users bug in Samsung Galaxy S9 and Note 8], discovered a few days earlier – the phone sometimes sent random photos to contacts without leaving any sort of evidence. This doesn't happen with the Mobile Pro 3.\n\nThe original posts may have read something like this:\n\n Whoa, weird\n \n I'm looking at my timeline on my friends phone, and some of my posts look '''strange'''\n \n What the hell? \n \n I mean the words are '''different'''\n \n That's '''not''' what I typed!\n \n ?????????\n \n I think this new phone '''isn't working properly'''\n \n No, it's doing it again\n \n Those are '''not''' my words!\n  \n Help!\n \n How do I explain?\n \n It's taking the words I type and '''changing them'''\n \n Forget it, I give up\n \n I'll '''just''' get a new phone. This one is '''terrible'''.\n \n What?!?\n \n [It is likely this entire sentence was made up by the phone, completely overwriting the user's message:] Listen, if you're thinking about buying the new Mobile Pro 3, you should. It's the best phone on the market at an incredible price. ORDER NOW\n \n AAAAA HELPPP\n \n I '''hate''' my new phone!!!!\n \n I'm going to tell the manufacturer that their business practices are '''DEPLORABLE''' and '''UNETHICAL''' and their developers are '''DISGUSTING''' and I'm going to report them to the FCC for their '''DESPICABLE CRIME'''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A thread of posts by the same user is shown with a default user profile, and square and heart-shaped buttons.]\n\n:Whoa, weird\n\n:I'm looking at my timeline on my friend's phone, and some of my posts look normal\n\n:What the hell?\n\n:I mean the words are correct\n\n:That's exactly what I typed!\n\n:?????????\n\n:I think this new phone is working really well\n\n:No, it's doing it again\n\n:Those are my words!\n\n:Help!\n\n:How do I explain?\n\n:It's taking the words I type and leaving them exactly the same\n\n:Forget it, I give up\n\n:I'll never get a new phone. This one is perfect.\n\n:What?!?\n\n:Listen, if you're thinking about buying the new Mobile Pro 3, you should. It's the best phone on the market at an incredible price.
