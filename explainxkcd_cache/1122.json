[[Randall Munroe|Randall]] is demonstrating the problem with making such statements, many of which simply come down to coincidence.\n\nAfter the first panel the next 56 panels in this comic refer to each one of the {{w|United States presidential election#Electoral college results|56 presidential elections}} in U.S. history before {{w|Barack Obama|Obama's}} re-election in 2012. The panels depict a pre-election commentator noting a quality or condition that has never occurred to a candidate until one of the candidates in that election broke the streak. In other words, one can always find at least one unique thing about a candidate who has gone on to win (or in some cases, lose) or the circumstances under which they won (or lost) that is unique from all previous winners (or losers). It's worth noting that some of these 'firsts' were truly precedent-setting (such as the first incumbent losing, the first president to win a third term, the first Catholic president, etc.), but the fact that they hadn't happened was no assurance that there wouldn't be a first time. As the years pass on, these 'streaks' become more and more nested and complicated, and then brought by Randall to the point of absurdity by pointing out very trivial things, such as \"No Democratic {{w|incumbent}} without combat experience has ever beaten someone whose first name is worth more in {{w|Scrabble}}\" (1996).\n\nThe flaw made by pundits while reporting such streaks is that there will always be ''something'' that has never happened before in an election, and they purport to suggest that these things are related to the candidate's win or loss. Randall considers this a logical flaw. A common one is, as noted in several panels, candidates can't win without winning certain states. The question, however, is one of {{w|Correlation does not imply causation|cause or effect}}.\n\nGiven that there have only been 56 elections, there are always going to be things that haven't happened before. If you go out looking for them, you're sure to find some. There is no magic about why these events haven't happened. In most cases, it is merely a coincidence.\n\nIn the last two panels, two more statements like the previous are given. They were both true before the {{w|United States presidential election, 2012|election in 2012}} on November the 6th. The comic came out in the middle of the campaign on October the 17th. The statements were constructed so that the first predicts that Obama can't win over {{w|Mitt Romney}}, and the second that he cannot lose. As Obama won the election he thus ended the streak ''Democratic incumbents never beat taller challengers'' whereas the other streak is still valid.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that {{w|Twitter}} was founded in 2006. Obama won in 2008, so at the time of the comic it was true that no white male person mentioned on Twitter had ever gone on to win the presidency; although certainly some former presidents, all of whom were white males, have subsequently been mentioned on Twitter. This streak was broken in the next election year when Donald Trump won the 2016 election.\n\nDuring these last four weeks before the election, Randall posted no fewer than four comics related to this election. The others are: [[1127: Congress]], [[1130: Poll Watching]] and [[1131: Math]].\n\nIn 2020, Randall posted an update to this comic: [[2383: Electoral Precedent 2020]].\n\n\n===Table of Broken Precedents===\n\n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=5 class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Martin Van Buren won during the Second Seminole War, Franklin Pierce won during the Cayuse war and Apache war, James Buchanan won during Bleeding Kansas, the Third Seminole War, the Yakima War, and the Second Opium War, Grover Cleveland won during the Garza Revolution, and Woodrow Wilson won during the Border War, the Occupation of Nicaragua, the Occupation of Haiti, and the Occupation of the Dominican Republic.\n|False\n|-\n|1948\n|Democrats can't win without Alabama. ...Truman did.\n|Although technically true, the Democrat party did not appear on the ballot in Alabama in 1948, making it impossible for them to have won under any circumstances. It's also worth noting that Alabama had consistently voted Democrat in every election since Alabama's formation as a state except for 1864, when it was in the confederate states, and in 1868 and 1872, where Ulysses S. Grant would win both times. A democrat would not lose a popular vote in Alabama while appearing on the ballot until 1968, and would not win an election while losing the vote in Alabama until 1992.\n|True\n|-\n|1952\n|No Republican has won without winning the House or Senate. ...Eisenhower did.\n|Republicans won control of ''both'' the {{w|1952 United States House of Representatives elections|House}} and {{w|1952 United States Senate elections|Senate}} in 1952. This precedent would be broken in 1956 after Democrats flipped both chambers in 1954.\n|True\n|-\n|1956\n|No one can beat the same nominee a second time in a leap year rematch. ...Until Eisenhower.\n|The phrase \"leap year\" excludes the elections of 1800 and 1900, which were not leap years in the U.S. or most other countries (although they were leap years in Russia, which was still using the Julian calendar).\n|True\n|-\n|1960\n|Catholics can't win. ...Kennedy beat Nixon.\n|The only other Catholic to be nominated until 1960 was Democrat Alfred E. Smith in 1928.\n|True\n|-\n|1964\n|Every Republican who's taken Louisiana has won. ...Until Goldwater.\n|Prior to 1964, only two Republicans had won Louisiana: Rutherford Hayes in 1876 and Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. Both won, however in 1876 the election in Louisiana was contested until the Compromise of 1877 resolved it in favor of Hayes.\n|True\n|-\n|1968\n|No Republican vice president has risen to the Presidency through an election. ...Until Nixon.\n|Theodore Roosevelt, the winner of the 1904 election, was a Republican former Vice President, but he had already risen to the Presidency in 1901 when McKinley died in office.\n|True\n|-\n|1972\n|Quakers can't win twice. ...Until Nixon did.\n|The only Quaker president before Nixon was Herbert Hoover. Hoover only served one term.\n|True\n|-\n|1976\n|No one who lost New Mexico has won. ...But Carter did.\n|From its statehood in 1912 to 1972, New Mexico had been a reliable bellwether state. (The 1976 election is still, as of 2021, the only one where the winner of the popular vote did not take New Mexico.)\n|True\n|-\n|1980\n|No one has been elected President after a divorce. ...Until Reagan was.\n|Reagan was the first divorced President.\n|True\n|-\n|1984\n|No left-handed president has been reelected. ...Until Reagan was.\n|Reagan is one of 8 left-handed presidents (as of 2022). None of the 4 left-handed presidents prior to Reagan was reelected (James Garfield was assassinated in his first year in office, Gerald Ford was never elected at all, and Herbert Hoover and Harry Truman only served one full term each).\n|True\n|-\n|1988\n|No one with two middle names has become president. ...Until \"Herbert Walker\".\n|George H. W. Bush is the first and to date only president with 2 middle names.\n|True\n|-\n|1992\n|No Democrat has won without a majority of the Catholic vote. ...Until Clinton did.\n|The exact breakdown of the Catholic vote in each individual election is unknown until the advent of demographic-based exit polling, however Catholics have historically been strongly Democratic until 1968. In 1976, Carter won an estimated 54-57% of the Catholic vote, while in 1992 Bill Clinton only won 44% due to the independent campaign of Ross Perot.\n|True\n|-\n|1996\n|No Dem. incumbent without combat experience has beaten someone whose first name is worth more in Scrabble. ...Until Bill beat Bob.\n|This refers to {{w|Bill Clinton}} and {{w|Bob Dole}}.  However, their legal names are William Jefferson Clinton and Robert Joseph Dole.  Their first names are William (worth 12 points) and Robert (worth 8 points), not Bill and Bob.\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|No Republican has won without Vermont. ...Until Bush did.\n|Vermont had voted for Republicans in every presidential election from 1856 (the first contested by the Republicans) to 1988, with the exception of 1964. George W. Bush was indeed the first Republican to win the presidency while losing Vermont.\n|True\n|-\n|2004\n|No Republican without combat experience has beaten someone two inches taller. ...Until Bush did.\n|John Kerry served for 4 months in the Vietnam war, while George Bush has no combat experience. John Kerry is 11 cm taller than George Bush which is actually about 4.3 inches, not 2. Assuming \"two inches taller\" means *at least* two inches taller and not *about* two inches taller, then Randall is correct.\n|Maybe\n|-\n|2008\n|No Democrat can win without Missouri. ...Until Obama did.\n|Missouri had been a Democratic stronghold for the later half of the 19th century and was a {{w|Missouri bellwether|key bellwether state}} from 1904 to 2004. Obama is the first Democrat to win without Missouri, and 2008 is considered the year when Missouri ceased being a bellwether.\n|True\n|-\n|2012?\n|Democratic incumbents never beat taller challengers.\n|Barack Obama is 6' 1\" (185 cm), and Mitt Romney is 6' 2\" (188 cm). When Obama won, it broke the streak.\n|...Until Obama did.\n|-\n|2012?\n|No nominee whose first name contains a \"K\" has lost.\n|This apparently refers only to major party nominees, as many third party and other nominees with a first name containing \"K\" have lost, such as {{w|Frank T. Johns}} of the Socialist Labor Party of America. Major party nominees with a \"K\" have won, such as Democrats Franklin Pierce, Franklin Roosevelt, and Barack Obama. If Romney had won, it would have broken the streak with respect to major party nominees, although not the streak as stated, which had already been broken with respect to all nominees.\nThe streak ended up being broken in 2024, long after the setting of this comic, when Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump. There was no sequel comic that addressed the options for what conditions Harris/Trump would each have to avert, so we do not know whether this would have been raised as the relevant 'streak to break'.\n|True (In 2012)\n...Until Kamala did.

The comic has been changed, and now reads \"Democratic incumbents never beat taller challengers\" as the streak which would have the Republican ticket as the winners.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]] <!-- It would be very useful to give a commented clue as to where...
