[[Megan]] sits at her computer and tells [[Cueball]] how exciting it will be when Dawn discovers what the cause of the \"stupid white dot\" on Ceres is.\n\n{{w|Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn}} is a probe sent by {{w|NASA}} in 2007 to examine the {{w|asteroid belt}}. Having already visited the {{w|protoplanet}} {{w|4 Vesta|Vesta}} in 2012, Dawn was scheduled to arrive at Ceres on March 6, 2015. Dawn's initial images of Ceres were released two days before this comic, quickly inspiring [http://www.universetoday.com/118358/first-hubble-and-now-dawn-have-seen-this-white-spot-on-ceres-what-is-it/ questions about the white spot]. The spot was first noticed in photographs taken by the {{w|Hubble Space Telescope}}.\n\n[https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/mystery-solved-bright-areas-on-ceres-come-from-salty-water-below/ Scientists] were to eventually figure out that the bright areas were deposits made mostly of sodium carbonate â€” a compound of sodium, carbon, and oxygen. They likely came from liquid that percolated up to the surface and evaporated, leaving behind a highly reflective salt crust.\n\n\"Inspected By No. 6\" refers to a series of quality assurance stickers used by US clothing manufacturers. Individual inspectors, each assigned a number, randomly sample products for workmanship. Accepted items are marked with that inspector's sticker. The presumed joke is that the white spot is a large sticker indicating that Ceres has passed inspection. This might also reference The Rift's M6 being stationed at Ceres inspecting a crater.\n\nHowever, this sticker could mean that there is life, probably a {{w|Type III civilisation|Type 3+ civilization.}} This would mean that there is life in this universe that has control over solar systems, potentially saying that there are Type 3, 4, and Type 5 civilizations out there since they can control solar systems.\n\nThe title text extends the joke to the planet Earth, where {{w|salmonella}} can be found. Salmonella are harmful bacteria sometimes found in food products subject to improper handling or overlong storage. Mixing the realms of astronomical objects and food once more, the title text concludes that the planet Earth hasn't been tested by CERES since salmonella can be found on it.\n\nThe Dawn mission is mentioned in [[1532: New Horizons]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan sitting in front of her laptop talks to Cueball who stand behind her.]\n:Megan: ''Dawn'' has almost reached Ceres. \n:Megan: I'm excited that we'll finally learn what that stupid white dot is.\n\n:[Current version of Dawn's best picture of Ceres and the white spot is shown.]\n\n:[As Dawn get's closer the pictures improve and in the second version the white spot shows to have black markings.]\n\n:[In the last zoom in on Ceres, the white dot resolves to a badge with clear black text:]\n:Inspected by No. 6\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Space probes]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
