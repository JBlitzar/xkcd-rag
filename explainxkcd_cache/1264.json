Some websites display images in the form of a slideshow like this comic, with slow zoom and pan effects and fades between the images. This effect has been dubbed the {{w|Ken Burns effect}} after documentary filmmaker {{w|Ken Burns}} who popularized the effect. In many cases, the slideshow is a fixed element, and can't be controlled by the user. This prevents the user from navigating through the images at their own pace or viewing any one image for an extended period, and can be distracting. [[Randall]] expresses frustration at this.\n\nThe title text suggests points will be awarded to whoever can add that annoying effect to the text editors of the developers of {{w|Flickr}}, a photo-hosting website, so they can be subjected to the same thing to which they are subjecting Randall. This may be a response to recent changes to Flickr's website that includes such slideshows as one option; that said, Flickr has always allowed users to browse galleries in a normal grid layout and with user-controlled photo-by-photo full-window layout.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Dear website operators,\n:[This strip is in the form of an animated gif. The panels transition with a Ken Burns-like fade-and-pan.]\n:[Cueball's whole body on the left side of the panel, looking slightly right of the camera.]\n:Cueball: I will ''never''...\n:[Cueball's body down to the ends of his arms is shown on the right side of the panel, looking slightly left of the camera.]\n:Cueball: ...want to browse a series of images...\n:[Cueball is shown standing in the middle of the panel, with his left hand up a little bit.\n:Cueball: ...like this.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with animation]]\n[[Category:Dynamic comics]]"
