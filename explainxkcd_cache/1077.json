In many cases, finding the best organization can be difficult and/or can take a long time. To skip this problem, Cueball \"Just Gives Up\" and puts all his items and furniture into a box labeled  \"Misc\" for miscellaneous, with the exception of his laptop, cable modem and router.\n\nItems in the box seem to include the following\n* A TV\n* A Lamp\n* A Broom\n* A Mattress\n* A Chair\n* A Shelf\n* A Fan\n* At least one Cable\n* And several other unidentifiable objects\n\nThe title text is a take on the popular website Lifehacker which includes all sorts of posts on how to \"hack\" your life and improve it. Life hacking appears to be a common theme in xkcd, such as in [[2024: Light Hacks]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[One big plain room with a person sitting on the floor with a laptop on one side, a modem and wireless router on the other, and a big box full of the usual accoutrements of living in the middle, with \"MISC\" written on the side.]\n\n:Home Organization Tip: Just Give Up.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Tips]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"
