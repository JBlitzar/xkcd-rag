This illusion is generally created by drawing white dots on the computer screen, and then moving these dots outwards towards the edge of the screen before disappearing. Some of the \"stars\" appear to pass closer to the viewing point than others, resulting in movements of visually greater speeds, and more excitement; one can also fixate the center of the screen, hoping to see the appearance of a star as close as possible to it, which would later on pass very close to the viewpoint. This comic extends it to the situation where the observer actually collides with one of these stars, something that never happens with screensavers of this type. The \"signal lost\" error message appears because the source of the signal is no longer transmitting, since it was destroyed when colliding with said star. It appears that the screensaver was generated by a real spacecraft taking pictures of the space.\n\nThe \"Duck Hunt gun\" is a reference to the {{w|NES Zapper}} used with the {{w|Nintendo Entertainment System}} game {{w|Duck Hunt}}, originally published in 1984. The user would point the Zapper at the connected television screen while playing Duck Hunt, and the NES would recognize whether or not the zapper was pointed at an appropriate target or not. \"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cm7tv5cM8g Flying Toasters]\" is another old screensaver (in the {{w|After Dark (software)|After Dark}} package, made for computers but not for the NES). In the title text, [[Randall]] states that he is trying to use the NES Zapper to shoot down flying toasters. However, the Flying Toaster screensaver and the NES Zapper are two separate things that were never meant to be used together, so the flying toasters will never react to being \"shot\" at by the NES Zapper.\n\n==Transcript==\n:I've been staring at the screen every night for twenty years, and it finally happened.\n:[A star field.]\n:[The same star field, but there's a larger white dot glowing in the middle.]\n:[The same star field, but that larger white dot's looking bigger now.
