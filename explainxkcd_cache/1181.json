Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identity of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.\n\nIn the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, [[Randall]] is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there ''is'' a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.\n\nThe title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.\n\n==Transcript==\n:How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic:\n:Look for this text at the top\n:[In mail header, light grey.] Reply\n:[Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text \"Look for this text at the top\" above.]\n:-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n:[In mail message, light grey.]\n:HASH: SHA256\n:Hey,\n:First of all, thanks for taking care of\n\n:[After mail message.]\n:If it's there, the email is probably fine\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Email]]\n[[Category:Cryptography]]"
