(Wiktionary gives three variations, /ˈdɛf.ɪ.nɪt.li/, /ˈdɛf.ə.nɪt.li/, /ˈdɛf.nɪt.li/, which are just some of the differences you might encounter.) Remembering that it ultimately has a common root with \"finite\", and thus has the two 'i's, might not help if you also/instead perhaps link it in your head to \"''define''\" (which might erroneously lead to \"''defin'''e'''tely''\") and not \"definition\".\n\nThe comic gives twelve 'words' that the subtitle claims are all real, and gives their definitions, whereas in reality only the first (the definitely definitive spelling of \"''definitely''\") and the last (defying the trend by being the actual word \"''{{wiktionary|defiantly}}''\") are indeed so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Word\n! Meaning\n! Notes\n|-\n| Definitely\n| Definitely\n| This is [[Definitely|definitively]] a real word.\n|-\n| Definetly\n| ''Almost'' definitely\n| This \"word\" has a Wiktionary entry that indicates it is a common misspelling of \"definitely.\"\n|-\n| Definately\n| Probably\n| This \"word\" has a Wiktionary entry that indicates it is a common misspelling of \"definitely.\" This word has also been used previously in [[1238: Enlightenment]].\n|-\n| Definatly\n| Probably not\n| This \"word\" has a Wiktionary entry that indicates it is a common misspelling of \"definitely.\"\n|-\n| Defenitely\n| Not telling (it's a surprise)\n| \n|-\n| Defintely\n| Per the prophecy\n| \n|-\n| Definetely\n| Definitely, maybe\n| This may reference one of {{w|Definitely Maybe (disambiguation)|several works}} in various fields of the arts.\n|-\n| Definantly\n| To be decided by coin toss\n| Use the finan of finance as the base\n|-\n| Defanitely\n| In one universe out of 14 million\n| This references the film ''{{w|Avengers: Infinity War}}''. In this movie, {{w|Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Doctor Strange}} looks into the future and sees 14 million possible outcomes, but in only one of them do the {{w|Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers}} win.\n|-\n| Defineatly\n| Only the gods know\n| \n|-\n| Definitly\n| Unless someone cute shows up\n| \n|-\n| Defiantly\n| Defiantly\n| This is a real word. However, \"defiantly\" may also be a common misspelling of 'Definitely', due to autocorrect functions. Other mistakes are caught and can be corrected, but the substitution of a different real word is harder to identify as wrong, especially when the correction mechanism jumped the 'wrong way' in rendering a correct spelling (e.g. the misspelling \"definatly\" (with both substitution and omission errors separating it from the intended word) may be deemed incorrectly correctable to \"defiantly\" (a single transposition away from what was typed)).\n|}\n\nThe first three alternate 'words' listed do have Wiktionary entries that indicate they are common mis-spellings of the first, and the last has a secondary 'meaning' of possibly being such an error, but (as of the publication of this comic/edit) the words \"''defenitely''\", \"''defintely''\", \"''definetely''\", \"''definantly''\", \"''defanitely''\", \"''defineatly''\" and \"''definitly''\" are ''so'' wrong that they don't even have a corrective article created for them. Some of them don't even look like they'd even be sufficiently homophonic substitutes, though the actions of accent and dialect may indeed be capable of creating compatible (mis)elocutions for each.\n\nThe title text adds to the word confusion by suggesting the real word \"''{{wiktionary|definitively}}''\" (for which Wiktionary has a 'See also' link to \"definitely\") be made to be used (against the will of a word-wise individual) as a substitution for the original definitely definitive spelling. In certain contexts it even fulfils the same basic sense as the original and so may survive proofreading by a third party. Or even the author glancing through their own work, and the brain not twigging the increased number of riser-rich characters but mentally voicing the intended word anyway... Even if it is noticed, it may be considered more a \"''{{wiktionary|thinko}}''\" than a \"''{{wiktionary|typo}}''\" as it keeps happening, at least until the afflicted typist starts to pay close and distracting attention to their output.\n\nThis kind of [[:Category:Substitutions|substitution]] is a recurring subject on xkcd, with one of the more famous ones being [[1031: s/keyboard/leopard/]], where \"''keyboard''\" is replaced by \"''leopard''\" in the text.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A list of 12 words with their meanings.
