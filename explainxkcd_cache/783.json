This would be easier if you weren't about to ask me to repeat it all back to you.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] wants to use his {{w|GPS navigation device|GPS device}} to find an individual's house, and therefore needs the house's address. The person on the phone is giving him directions, something that is useless because by giving Cueball the address, the GPS can give directions to the address, possibly better than the ones he is getting over the phone. Cueball then decides to tell the person that he would like to mail something to their house, hoping they will give him the address, because you must have the address to mail something.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text is a continuation of the comic's joke. By the end of the comic, Cueball has got the information he needs, and has just ignored the directions he did not want. However, if the person on the phone insists on checking Cueball has remembered the directions correctly, Cueball has to be able to learn the useless information he did not want in the first place, and has been mostly ignoring, at least well enough to repeat it once.\n\nJudging by the roads mentioned in the comic (Highland Rd and presumably {{w|Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495}} and {{w|Massachusetts Route 18|MA-18}}), the person on the phone lives somewhere around [http://goo.gl/maps/tXFbF southern Lakeville, Massachusetts], and Cueball is starting from the Boston area.\n\nThe superfluousness of giving directions as opposed to using a GPS is also mentioned in [[1155: Kolmogorov Directions]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball on phone.]\n:Cueball: Looking forward to seeing your new place! What's the address?\n:Cueball: Mm hmm. Yes, I'm taking 495, but I have a GPS, so I really just need the street address.\n\n:[Close up.]\n:Cueball: ...then south on 18, okay, but I have a GPS, so if you just want to skip to the street address, I can...\n\n:[Full body shot, facing other direction.]\n:Cueball: Thanks, I'm glad to know Highland Road comes a mile after the big intersection, but I keep saying I ''have a GPS'', can you tell me the street address?\n:Cueball: ...\n:Cueball: Technically that's just more information on how to get to your place, not the address itself. If you could-\n\n:[Close up again, Cueball writing on pad.]\n:Cueball: ...I appreciate that you want to help, but I'm ''ignoring'' you and just waiting for the...\n:Cueball: Listen, I just remembered I need to mail you a letter. What's your address?\n:Cueball: Mhm... okay...\n:Cueball: Great, thanks! I'll see you in an hour!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
