Sure, there are upwards of 80% losses, but I prefer to think of them as nearly 20% gains.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is another comic in the [[:Category: My Hobby|My Hobby series]]. It plays on how energy from natural resources (wind, sun, water) gets turned into electricity. {{w|Wind turbine|Wind turbines}} convert the wind power into rotational energy, which can then be used to produce electricity. The one seen in the image is the most commonly known wind turbine, which is use on wind farms. Wind turbines provide a renewable resource for homes and cities and a common method for sustainable energy. Turbines have been referenced before in xkcd, in [[556: Alternative Energy Revolution]].\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] has rigged it so that the wind turbine powers a {{w|mechanical fan|fan}}. He cut the power cable attaching the turbine to the {{w|Electrical grid|power grid}} and spliced it with the power cord of a giant fan. The nailed-together 2x4s that form the \"tower\" for the fan further indicate the \"[https://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/jerry.html jury-rigged]\" nature of Cueball's work. The electricity generated from the wind power is then used to power the fan, which in turn produces wind. This is about the complementary nature of wind turbines and fans, which was also covered in [[1378: Turbine]].\n\nThe undoing part refers to how Cueball is using this fan to restore the wind that was used to turn the wind turbine back to the original wind flow, canceling out not only the turbine's electricity production, but also its slight reduction of the surrounding wind force.\n\nWind turbines have a {{w|Wind turbine#Efficiency|theoretical limit of 59%}} of the portion of wind captured. You can see the wind not captured detailed in the image as dotted, turbulent curly lines; turbulent flow. Cueball has placed the giant fan in the direction of the wind so that the wind it produces combines with the windpower not captured by the wind turbine. This is indicated by the lines smoothing like they were at the start. Thus, not only is the electrical benefit undone, but also the change in natural wind currents.\n\nThe title text explains that he performs the same undoing process with solar cells, where light energy is converted into electricity using {{w|photovoltaic cells}}, which is then used to power lightbulbs for producing light on the area below them that the sun would normally illuminate. {{W|Solar panels}} only convert 20-25% of the energy captured from the sun into electricity. However, Cueball points out that he sees this as a 20% gain rather than an 80% loss. Since it is Cueball's hobby to waste time and energy, this makes perfect sense.\n\nIncandescent light bulbs only convert at most 5% of the electricity provided into light, the rest is lost as heat energy. Thus less than 1% of the energy absorbed from the original sunlight will be released as light from the bulb. LED bulbs can do quite a bit better, approaching 90% efficiency, and releasing around 17% of the original sunlight, though in different frequencies.\n\nIn the case of the wind turbine and fan, the wind will, unfortunately, be moving at a much slower velocity than at the start as energy was lost in converting wind power to rotation energy, then to electricity, then back to rotational energy, then back to windpower. However, in the solar panel and lamp case, the light will be moving at the same speed as it entered the panel thanks to the constant nature of the speed of light, but be less bright instead.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:My Hobby:\n\n:[A large wind turbine is spinning but the electric cord has been severed and rewired to a large fan, with Cueball standing next to it]\n\n:[Caption in large text below the panel:]\n:Undoing\n\n==Trivia==\n\nA similar understanding of the difference between a wind turbine and a fan is presented by [[Megan]] in the later comic: [[1378: Turbine]].\n\nThis comic may be a continuation of [[Randall|Randall's]] mistrust of modern electric wind turbines (see [[556: Alternative Energy Revolution]]).\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Weather]]\n[[Category:Wind turbine]]"
