Just gonna, uh, go through and delete that from all my archives real quick.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic came out the day after [https://news.sky.com/story/andy-warhol-originals-found-on-floppy-disk-10408391 Sky News published the story] of original {{w|Andy Warhol}} artwork, created in 1985 on an {{w|Amiga 1000}}, which was recovered from recently found floppy disks.\n\n[[Cueball]] is shown literally digging through a pile of old files; which is a metaphor for looking through old files on his computer. The layers of the pile are arranged much like geological rock formations where older strata are deeper down than younger layers. The files are in concentric layers because each directory is embedded in the previous directory. Therefore, the \"Documents\" folder contains an \"Old Desktop\" folder, which contains a folder with files recovered from an older system, which itself contains a \"My Documents\" folder, which contains a folder with files copied from a {{w|Zip Disk}} from high school. The result is that files from high school have survived in his present-day machine. These older folders serve as a time capsule of sorts, storing old files from {{w|AOL}}, NYET, and {{w|Kazaa}}. These files are meant to be analogous to the fossils and artifacts found in lower, older rock layers.\n\nThe sizes of the files decrease as Cueball goes deeper, since data storage has gotten cheaper over time. When the Zip Drive first came out, it cost $200 USD (plus $20 per 100 MB floppy). As of 2019, $200 could buy you at least an 8 TB portable external hard drive. In the 1990s, during AOL's heyday, 10+ GB hard drives were prohibitively expensive and a terabyte of data was unimaginable to most users.\n\nDeep down, Cueball discovers several files he is surprised about, including a poetry file which embarrasses him as he does not remember writing poetry. \n\nIn the title text, he mentions also finding an \"{{w|Animorphs}} Novel\", which may be a text copy of one of the original books or a fan fiction of the ''Animorphs'' series (his reaction of quickly eradicating it may either be to prevent him being caught with a presumably-illegal copy of an Animorphs book or as a result of embarrassment at his fan fiction - the former is less likely than the latter considering some of the other files mentioned, so it is most likely a fan fiction). The series was released between 1996 and 2001, consistent with the fact that these files were created during Cueball/[[Randall|Randall's]] high school years. The series was extremely popular at the time. Animorphs has already been mentioned in the title text of [[1187: Aspect Ratio]], and later it was the main joke in [[1380: Manual for Civilization]] and [[1817: Incognito Mode]].\n\n===Files and Folders===\nThe folders and files in detail:\n\n'''Documents''' (47 GB): A large folder containing many of [[Cueball]]'s personal files.\n*''misc.txt'': A miscellaneous {{w|text file}}, which could contain anything; possibly just various notes that Cueball is keeping.\n\n*''Video projects'': As video files can take up a lot of space and video projects tend to use a lot of them, this likely makes up a considerable portion of the 47 GB.\n\n'''Old desktop''' (12 GB): A backup from a former computer.\n*''{{w|Facebook}} pics'': Pictures that were intended to be added to Facebook (and/or ones which were downloaded *from* Facebook).\n*''Pics from other camera'': Unknown pictures from a second camera.\n*''Temp'': Temporary folders generally contain cached files and files that are used temporarily to install programs. A folder named \"Temp\" might also be created by a user to store unimportant text or image files, not intending or caring to give it a more meaningful or specifically explanatory name.\n*''Misc {{w|Portable Document Format|PDF}}s'': PDFs are often used for documentation, but could be any collection of digitized books or other documents.\n*''{{w|MP3}}'': MP3 is a widely used format for digital audio files.\n\n'''Recovered from drive crash''' (4 GB): When a {{w|Hard disk drive|hard drive}} crashes, some or all data may be recovered.\n*''Temp'': Temporary files.\n*''Work misc'': Unknown work related projects.\n*''{{w|Audiobook|Audio books}}'':  Recordings of books being read out loud.\n\n'''My Documents''' (570 MB): {{w|Windows XP}} user accounts came with a \"My Documents\" folder that was widely used for storing personal files. The items in this archive came from the era when {{w|Windows XP}} was popular.\n*''Downloads'': The default download folder for most browsers of the time.\n*''{{w|Kazaa}} shared'': Kazaa is a defunct peer-to-peer file sharing program. The \"shared\" folder is shared with other members.\n*''AYB'': {{w|All your base are belong to us|ALL YOUR BASE are belong to us}} is an internet {{w|Meme|meme}} inspired by a bad translation from ''{{w|Zero Wing}}''. Also referenced in [[286: All Your Base]].\n*''{{w|Escape Velocity Override|EV Override}}'': An {{w|Apple Macintosh}} video game, released in 1998.\n*''[http://rephial.org/ Angband]'': A game named after a fictional stronghold created by {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien}}.\n*''{{w|GIF}}s'': An image format widely used for transparent or animated images.\n*''{{w|Fight Club}}.wmv'': A movie. As feature movies are typically compressed to 700 megabytes, and this folder only contains 570 MB ''in its entirety'', including 94 MB explicitly in a further sub-folder, this one file must be significantly smaller. It could be of very low quality (e.g. resolution and/or frame-rate), truncated (after a prior failed copy) or even a fake download designed to [https://www.2-spyware.com/fake-codecs-that-drop-widely-spread-malware fool unwary recipients].\n*''{{w|Elasto Mania}}'': A physics-simulation game that claims to show real physics.\n*''{{w|AOL Instant Messenger|AIM}} Direct Connect files'': Files transferred via AOL Instant Messenger.\n*''{{w|4chan}}'': An image-board where users can upload pictures anonymously. Randall impulsively saves pictures from there. This entry is something of an anomaly, the rest of the files at this level were most notable around 1998 to 2001 while 4chan was only launched at the end of 2003.  Since this board frequently contains images you wouldn't want to be caught looking at, this folder may be buried to hide it.\n*''{{w|ICQ}} logs'': Logs from a now-defunct instant messaging program introduced in 1996.\n\n'''High school {{w|Zip drive|Zip disk}}''' (94 MB): The most popular form of {{w|superfloppy}}, introduced in 1994 with a capacity of 100 MB.\n*''{{w|Korn}} MIDI'': Korn is an American {{w|nu metal}} band formed in 1993. {{w|MIDI}} is a protocol for communication with electronic musical instruments. The result tends to be sounds of low quality (but it heavily depends on how MIDI is played).\n*''Photos3'': This is a folder of old photos.\n**''{{w|Prom}}'': Pictures taken at prom.\n*''lovenote.txt'': An old text file of a {{w|love letter}}, probably to a classmate in high school. Possibly referencing [[340: Fight]].\n*''{{w|Gorillas (video game)|Gorilla}}.bas'': A game written in {{w|BASIC}}, to be run on {{w|QBasic}}, and supplied with MS-DOS. \n*''Dream.txt'': Some private dreams.  Possibly a reference to [[269|269: TCMP]].\n*''James.txt'': This may be [[James Zetlen]], one of [[:Category:Friends of Randall|Randall's friends]].\n*''{{w|AOL}}'':  An early online and internet service, founded in 1985 and popular in the 1990s.\n**''{{w|Citadel (software)|Citadel}}'' -  A {{w|BBS}} and email platform that was widely used in the 1980s and early '90s.\n*''{{w|QBasic}}'': An {{w|Integrated development environment|IDE}} released by {{w|Microsoft}} in 1991, which was used to write and run computer programs in the BASIC language.\n*''NYET'': ''NYET'' was a {{w|Tetris}}-like game for MS-DOS, released in 1988.\n*''Jokes.txt'': An old text file of jokes.\n\n'''AAAFILES''' (9.4 MB): Some of [[Cueball]]'s oldest documents, likely prefixed with \"AAA\" to put the folder at the top of an alphabetically-sorted list.\n\n'''TXT''' (850 K): Old text files, which include poetry he didn't remember writing.\n\n==Transcript==\n[Cross-sectional view of what look vaguely like stratigraphic layers underground. A crevice leads down through these concentric layers to a cave-like cavity in the middle, where Cueball is going through the deepest, most central, and incidentally smallest of the files. Above, Megan stands at \"ground level\", looking down into the crevice.]\n\n:Megan: You OK down there?\n\n:'''Documents''' (47 GB)\n::misc.txt\n::Video projects\n:'''Old desktop''' (12 GB)\n::Facebook pics\n::Pics from other camera\n::Temp\n::Misc PDFs\n::MP3\n:'''Recovered from drive crash''' (4 GB)\n::Temp\n::Work misc\n::Audio books\n:'''My Documents''' (570 MB)\n::Downloads\n::Kazaa shared\n::AYB\n::EV Override\n::Angband\n::GIFs\n::FIGHT CLUB.wmv\n::Elasto Mania\n::AIM Direct Connect files\n::4chan\n::ICQ logs\n:'''High school Zip disk''' (94 MB)\n::Korn MIDI\n::Photos3 (Prom)\n::lovenote.txt\n::Gorilla.bas\n::Dream.txt\n::James.txt\n::AOL (Citadel)\n::QBasic\n::NYET\n::Jokes.txt\n:'''AAAFILES''' (9.4 MB)\n:'''TXT''' (850 K)\n:Cueball (deep inside the AAAFILES section looking at his txt files): Oh my god.
