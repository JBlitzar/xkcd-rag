[[Cueball]] counts his pet peeves; this is number 114.\n\nCueball's friend calls him and finds out that he is reading a book on a Saturday night. Some consider Saturday nights, or the weekend in general, to be a time for enjoying or partying with friends after five weekdays of work. But Cueball is annoyed by the fact that people are stuck with the stereotype of partying out on weekends. In his view, reading a good book is also a great way of enjoying the weekend. His annoyance is expressed in the title text.\n\nThis was the first time [[Randall]] mentions his many [[:Category:Pet Peeves|Pet Peeves]]. Although the next already appeared in [[283: Projection]] four months later, still in 2007, it is a slow growing list, but one has been added roughly every other year since then, the fifth coming towards the end of 2018 in [[2080: Cohort and Age Effects]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball reading a book in a chair.]\n:Pet Peeve #114:\n:Voice on the phone: Really?
