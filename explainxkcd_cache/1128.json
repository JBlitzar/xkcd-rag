''{{w|Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone}}'' was a children's TV show about a dog who draws parallels between literature and real life in his dreams, reenacting many literary classics. The show was especially praised in its time for refusing to censor the more unpleasant aspects of its source work. Many people within [[Randall]]'s age group have experienced more literary classics through ''Wishbone'' than by actually reading them; this phenomenon lead to the formation of a Facebook group (now replaced by a [https://www.facebook.com/No-I-havent-Read-that-Great-Literary-Classic-but-Ive-seen-the-Wishbone-162079210527833/ page]) with over 70,000 members dedicated to that idea.\n\nIn the comic, [[Cueball]] claims to have learned all that he knows about ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' from the ''Wishbone'' adaptation of the book. Knowing the faithful nature of ''Wishbone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s adaptations, an episode on the book would likely involve age-inappropriate material for children, as the sounds emanating from the TV would suggest.\n\nIn the title text:\n*{{w|Great Illustrated Classics}} is a series of easy to read adaptations of literary classics, including works by {{w|Charles Dickens}} and Stevenson's ''{{w|Treasure Island}}''.\n*''{{w|The Anarchist Cookbook}}'', first published in 1971, is a book that contains instructions for the manufacture of explosives, rudimentary telecommunications phreaking devices, and other items. It was written by William Powell to protest United States involvement in the Vietnam War.\n*''{{w|Our Bodies, Ourselves}}'' is a book about women's health and sexuality produced by the nonprofit organization Our Bodies Ourselves (originally called the Boston Women's Health Book Collective). First published in 1971, it contains information related to many aspects of women's health and sexuality, including menopause, birth control, childbirth, sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health and general well-being.\n\nPart of the title text joke is that the latter two works would not likely be the subject of Great Illustrated Classics or ''Wishbone''. However, the title text may be actually technically 100% correct, if Randall hasn't ever had an in-depth conversation about either of the latter two works.\n\nThe book was later made into a film which was referenced in [[1585: Similarities]] almost three years later.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting on the floor watching his TV standing on a small table. He is leaning back on one arm resting the other arms hand on his knee. Light is coming out from the TV screen, as shown with nine small lines. A high sound is shown above the TV in a starburst and the sound of a dog barking is coming out from the screen with a line indicating this. Above the drawings there are two paragraphs of text:]\n:As with most famous books, I've never actually '''read''' ''Fifty Shades of Grey.''\n:I only know the plot from watching the ''Wishbone'' version.\n:Dog in movie: Bark!\n:Dog in movie: Bark!\n:Sound: ''Smack!''\n:Dog in movie: Bark!:\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]"
