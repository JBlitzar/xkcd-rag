Here [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] have invented a mattress with a slot in it to solve that problem. To provide an activity for their lower arms when they are comfortably placed in that slot, they have installed a game of \"{{w|Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots}}\" underneath the bed.\n\nThe humor arises from the juxtaposition of a sedate activity like cuddling with a boisterous activity like \"Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots\" with the implication that Megan and Cueball are doing both at once.\n\nThe title text refers to a series of commercials for {{w|Tempur-Pedic}} mattresses where the presenter would place a wine glass on the mattress and then jump up and down somewhere else on the mattress. The fact that the wine did not spill was meant to indicate that one partner's motions would not disturb the other. It is implied that he did that test on this mattress and fell into the slot, breaking his ankle in the process.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are cuddling.]\n:Cuddling face-to-face is nice, but we can never figure out where to put our lower arms.\n:Our solution: the Cuddle Mattress!\n:Your lower arms fit in the convenient gap.\n:[There is a diagram of a mattress with a notch cut through it at shoulder level. The gap is indicated with an arrow.]\n:[The same couple is shown again, cuddling snugly on the mattress.]\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are giving a presentation to another person. Cueball has a pointer and a clicker for the slides that are projected on the screen next to him.]\n:Listener: Oh man, that's ALWAYS bothered me.\n:Listener: I want one.\n\n:Listener: Although... so the lower arms just sort of dangle?\n:Listener: What do you do with them?\n\n:Cueball: It was a bit awkward.\n:Clicker: ''click''\n:Megan: Then we had a second breakthrough.\n\n:[The couple is shown again on the cuddle mattress, this time in more detail and facing the tops of their heads. Their lower arms are sticking through the gap in the mattress and playing a conveniently located game of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.]\n:Cueball: ''click click''\n:Blue Robot: ''punch''\n:Red Robot: ''punch''\n:Megan: ''click click''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
