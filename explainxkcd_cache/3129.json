He presents {{w|Copper extraction#History|the use of metals}} as his improvement over the stone {{w|arrowhead}}s used by early humans. \n\nThe caption below the comic tells us that Cueball has based his entire {{w|dissertation}} on the false proposition that an archaeologist's job is to advance technology from some historic level, rather than revealing it. This would be considered disastrous for Cueball, as dissertations take a large amount of time and effort to complete, and he may have instead used the effort to effectively reengineer several thousand years of human development, leading away from the original subject, if not just have taken on entirely modern techniques and learnt nothing of any value at all. He even calls the process he uses \"my method\", perhaps implying/claiming that it is a personal innovation with ''no'' historical standing.\n\nSome archaeologists put considerable effort into researching the processes used to create ancient technologies to determine how they were achieved, when historical records do not include that information, and asking questions such as which processes could have led to the objects that we see now. Researchers into stoneworking methods do examine extant flint arrowheads, and the locations in which they were made, and then test knapping procedures for themselves to find out what gives results consistent with the evidence.\n\nCueball might have initially pursuing this approach, but has then skipped to an entirely different set of materials and processes. Also, though there were indeed copper arrowheads in subsequent pre-history, there is no sign that he even tried to match and recreate what he is doing now against what evidence suggests actually directly superseded the use of flint.\n\nThe title text claims that his 'discoveries' are unappreciated ''not'' because they are useless (in a completely different context, they might be an exciting academic pursuit), but because the academic 'establishment' has a stranglehold on the arrowhead industry and too many vested interests in flint-knapping to allow the {{w|disruptive innovation}} that this new change to copper weaponry might herald.  This is a humorous mashup of two classes of conspiracy theories, those of academia suppressing \"the TRUTH\" (according to pseudo-historians) and of oil, pharmaceutical, or other industries suppressing \"free energy\" or other such \"innovations\". In addition, {{w|Industry (archaeology)|\"industry\"}} is a term used in archaeology to describe specific types of tools made with the same methods; Cueball's technique would, technically, be its own new industry.\n\nIt also opens up the alternate interpretation that the comic instead depicts a historic presentation, as a counterpart to how others depict [[2990: Late Cenozoic|future ones]]<!-- ...I'm sure there's one that's got an anti-gravity noteboard with some presenter hovering with an antigrav backpack, more clearly a (human-)future presentation, but I can't currently find it... -->, set in the actual later-Paleolithic age, where this depicts the ''actual'' innovation of previously unknown metalworking techniques, leading up to the actual disruption of society that occured and potentially very real resistance by the traditionalists of the time. Though the existence of a a pull-down screen/displayboard in this period of history would be an entirely different level of anachronism.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands in front of a roll-down projector screen, pointing to it behind him as he looks forward giving a presentation. The screen depicts two arrowheads: On the left is an rough arrowhead hewn from stone and on the right is a smoother arrowhead with just one a small dent in its surface. The arrowheads have labels beneath them, and beneath each label there is an extra line of text in brackets:]\n:'''<big>Stone</big>''' (traditional)\n:'''<big>Copper</big>''' (my method)\n\n:Cueball: In the process of analyzing Paleolithic stone toolmaking, I've stumbled on an improved technique for producing points and blades.\n:Cueball: Instead of stone, my method is based on the heating and shaping of copper ore...\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Too late, I realized that my entire archaeology dissertation had been based on a colossal misunderstanding.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
