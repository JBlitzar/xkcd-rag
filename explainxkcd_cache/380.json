It appears that the basilisk's power is fully compatible with the 21st century, and can kill you just with a smiley emoticon over instant messaging. \n\nCueball's request for A/S/L was a standard question when first meeting someone online; it asks for {{w|Age/sex/location|age, sex (gender), and location}}.\n\nThe title text mentions U+FDD0, claimed to be the character for \"eye of the basilisk\". In reality this is a code for a {{w|Unicode#Character General Category|\"non-character\"}} in Unicode.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at computer, typing.]\n:~!~ Opening Chat with BSLSK05\n:<NICKM> Hi!\n:<NICKM> A/S/L?\n:[Next unframed panel]\n:<BSLSK05> :)\n:[Two smaller panels where the smiley appears bigger]\n:[Cueball looks stunned, flies backward.]\n:[Two smaller frames focus in on BSLSK05's emoticon, implying rotation to show a smile and two open eyes.]\n:[Cueball at computer slouches in chair, dead, crossbones above his head.]\n:[At the remote computer, a basilisk is looking at its screen.]\n\n== Trivia ==\nU+FDD0 did in fact kill at least one chat client at the time. Konversation in particular. (and presumably any other Qt-based chat clients using QTextDocument)\n\n\"basically u+fdd0 (eye of basilisk, the snake) is in a char range that's marked for interchange and illegal in utf-8\"\n\n\"but qt's utf-8 encoder let it through anyway\"\n\n\"but it just so happens that qt's qtextdocument uses u+fdd0 as text frame delimiter\"\n\n\"so when you append it to a qtd, counters run wrong and eventually you crash\"\n\n\"d-bus closes the connection and crashes the client when it encounters illegal utf-8, and kde's notification system works through d-bus\"\n\nThe problem was fixed after the xkcd \"report\" and Konversation now handles unicode normally.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Unicode]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]"
