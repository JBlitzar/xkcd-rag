It is typically used as a response to someone \"oversharing\" â€” telling personal details (\"Sorry I just missed your call - I was urinating when the phone rang\") that the listener would rather not have heard. Here, however, [[Cueball]] may be using it in a more literal and absolute sense: he feels {{w|Information overload|overwhelmed by the colossal amount of information}} that is now generally available to anyone with an Internet connection.\n\nThe title text amplifies this interpretation by evoking the image of an individual person who is overcome as he stands at the edge of the ocean, contemplating its vastness.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a desk, looking at a laptop.]\n:Cueball: Ugh, TMI.\n\n:Offscreen: Oh? What?\n\n:Cueball: Just... Everything.\n:Offscreen: ''True.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
