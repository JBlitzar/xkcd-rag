Consequently, the song coming out of [[Cueball]]'s TV right now is a take on that song. ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' is about the protagonist (played by {{w|Will Smith}}) moving from the urban Philadelphia streets to posh Bel-Air; this parody is a reversal of that concept. The joke is on Will Smith going from being a successful rapper to an ambitious politician. This may be seen as a sort of {{w|gentrification}} of black culture, one of the main themes of the original TV series.\n\n{{w|Doggerel}} is a derogatory term for verse considered of little literary value or a comic verse of irregular measure, or in this case, rap music. Obviously, the song is updated with a reference to {{w|Adele (singer)|Adele}}, who was, of course, not performing during the series' run, seeing as she was two years old at its start.\n\nIn the last panel, Cueball is annoyed about this stupid show and he switches to another channel or turns the TV off. The timing of the \"click\" indicates that he became annoyed when the song turned into a political advertisement and/or he did not want to hear \"some Adele for ya\" be rhymed with the name of the city {{w|Philadelphia}}.\n\nThe title text refers to ''{{w|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington}}'', a 1939 Academy Award-winning movie about an idealistic young man who is chosen to be a Senator and soon finds himself battling corrupt politicians, perhaps as Will Smith might be in this comic. The two characters/character and actor is a coincidence that Randall plays on. {{w|Aaron Sorkin}} is the writer behind the comedy drama ''{{w|The American President}}'' and the creator of political television drama ''{{w|The West Wing}}''. {{w|Pat Toomey}} is a former U.S. Senator of Pennsylvania (which includes Philadelphia), who served two terms from 2011 to 2023.\n\nThe theme song of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was also referenced in [[464: RBA]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits on an easy chair in front of a TV.]\n:TV: Well, my posh Bel Air life took a turn for the worse.\n\n:TV: It's a story best related in a doggerel verse.\n\n:TV: So kick back, relax, lemme put on some Adele for ya,\n\n:[Cueball raises the remote and points at the screen.]\n:TV: While I tell you why I'm running for mayor of Phila-\n:''CLICK''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]"
