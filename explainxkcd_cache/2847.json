It's based on the fact that trees add a new ring each year, so counting the rings will tell a tree's age in years. Additionally, climate and ecology affect the size and composition of each year's ring, so scientists can use rings to estimate what conditions were like each year. They can cross-compare tree-ring samples from overlapping date ranges, of comparable trees grown and felled at different times, to build up and confirm a useful ring history well beyond that of a single tree.\n\nIn some cases, tree rings contain remnants of specific events, such as forest fires, large volcano eruptions, atomic tests or droughts. Extremely disparate years can often be seen represented by a clear visual change in the usual subtle variation of ring-growth. The comic posits that, in 1635, trees somehow became {{w|carnivorous}}. The ring for that year contains indications of the bones of the creatures that they ate. This was just a temporary condition, since the rings after this have no bones, but clearly was a coordinated event among different trees to have caused this to be a comparable marker. Events such as this may have reoccurred at other times, just not again/before within the lifetime of the particular tree illustrated.\n\nThe title text says that anomalous years like this are called 'Miyake events', after a scientist named Miyake who discovered them (and was subsequently eaten by the trees, similar to the origin of {{w|Thagomizer}}). In actual fact, a {{w|Miyake event}} is a period when a larger-than-normal quantity of certain isotopes are created by cosmic rays, possibly due to [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11063 extreme solar flares]. Evidence of these events can often be found in ancient tree rings, as physicist {{w|Fusa Miyake}} discovered when investigating tree rings from years 774-775. However, she wasn't then devoured by the trees â€“ certainly not in 1635, which is centuries prior to her 2012-13 publications.{{cn}}\n\n<!-- Perhaps a ==Trivia== section? But I really wanted a nice wiki-like summary of things, anyway, falling back on Google's basic search -->A surprising number of [https://www.google.com/search?q=things+found+in+trees things can be actually found within the 'flesh' of trees], though mostly inorganic items (e.g., metal tools) that are placed and abandoned there long enough for the tree to expand its bark and woody trunk around them. Skeletal remains are more often found [https://www.google.com/search?q=human+bones+in+trees in the roots of fallen trees]. They are mostly{{Actual citation needed}} from bodies that were there before the tree started to germinate, or perhaps even were buried and then a tree deliberately planted to either mark or obscure the burial site. It is even possible that the young tree significantly benefits from nutrients derived from the presence of the cadaver, as certain actual {{w|carnivorous plant}}s have evolved to do, allowing it to thrive more than other saplings, but in this case it would not be through the plant itself pursuing a 'deliberately' carnivorous behaviour.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A round cross section of a tree in beige, with a brown bark around the outside and 33 narrow rings, along with one very wide ring that contains various white bones, including limb bones, vertebrae, and jaw bones. The wide ring appears after the 26th narrow ring.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Dendrochronologists can date wood samples by identifying growth ring anomalies that correspond to specific events. For example, it's often possible to spot the horrible summer of 1635 when trees turned carnivorous.   \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
