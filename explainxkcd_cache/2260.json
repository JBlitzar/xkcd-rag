The words \"Reaction Map\" in Chemistry refer to a diagram that shows how compounds react to form different compounds; an example can be found [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle here].\n\nIn this comic, [[Ponytail]] texts the following car pun/joke:\n:You should name your new Honda Civic ''The Treaty of Edinburgh''\n:Because it's a Tudor compact [\"Tudor\" pronounced \"two-door\" in some USA accents, \"tyudor\" elsewhere.]\n\nThe {{w|Treaty of Edinburgh}} was a treaty drawn up in 1560, which falls during the {{w|Tudor period}} of the history of {{w|England}}, while a compact is another word for a treaty -- hence a Tudor compact. A {{w|Honda Civic}} is a {{w|compact car}}, which has a {{w|coupé}} body model with only two doors (there are also hatchback and 4-door sedan versions) -- hence a two-door compact. The joke is thus a double pun on the similarity of the words \"Tudor\" and \"two-door\", as well as a pun on the words \"treaty\" and \"compact.\"\n\nPronouncing \"Tudor\" as \"Tyoo-dor\" (i.e. without American-style [[wikipedia:Yod-dropping|yod-dropping]]) rather than \"Too-\" may hinder comprehension of this pun.\n\nPuns rise and fall in popularity, and some people dislike them at all times. Recipients [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/why-do-puns-make-people-groan/398252/ often groan], sometimes even while laughing or smiling. Because of this pun, [[Cueball]] gets so mad at Ponytail that he replies twice, first that their friendship is over and second that he hopes she falls in a lake. Both times he uses driving directions to do so because he wishes to show how mad he is by spending time finding cities with relevant names just to do it. \n\nThe [https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Truly,+MT+59421/Saari,+L'Anse+Township,+MI+49946/Toulouse,+Kentucky/A,+Clay+County,+WV/Friendship,+South+Carolina/This+Way,+Lake+Jackson,+TX+77566/@37.9396464,-104.4176717,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m38!4m37!1m5!1m1!1s0x53424d6552eab029:0xb7fcd8937da3ec25!2m2!1d-111.4413578!2d47.3557881!1m5!1m1!1s0x4d50e1468af1ce9b:0xb02e7ce99f9e641a!2m2!1d-88.3092692!2d46.8784933!1m5!1m1!1s0x8844b40da22762bf:0xee4cd8dba67a2afa!2m2!1d-83.3269444!2d37.1766667!1m5!1m1!1s0x884943786da899b1:0x5eb17b45f77f3480!2m2!1d-81.0533854!2d38.5410076!1m5!1m1!1s0x88ffff04df8a3dc1:0x2e50cd1fdf10df52!2m2!1d-79.4353317!2d34.0168293!1m5!1m1!1s0x864043e6372e0009:0x1372621459655543!2m2!1d-95.4597276!2d29.0382495!3e0 list of map destinations], Truly (MT), Saari (MI), Toulouse (KY), A (WV), {{w|Friendship,_South_Carolina|Friendship}} (SC), This Way (TX) is a way of saying, \"Truly sorry to lose a friendship this way\".\nThe [https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hope,+NY+12134/Yoe,+PA/Fallin+Lake,+Magnolia+Township,+AR/@38.214792,-88.0772473,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m20!4m19!1m5!1m1!1s0x89df00206dc519a7:0x8c095186fc80dee1!2m2!1d-74.2431907!2d43.3036812!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c8886da851113b:0x96fa3e47edbd1953!2m2!1d-76.6369116!2d39.9089887!1m5!1m1!1s0x8633c43fa49e5997:0x864650e233fea97b!2m2!1d-93.3167015!2d33.2840166!3e0 list of map destinations], {{w|Hope, New York|Hope}} (NY), {{w|Yoe, Pennsylvania|Yoe}} (PA), Fallin Lake (AR) is a way of saying, \"Hope you fall in [a] lake\".\n\n\"A\" is [https://goo.gl/maps/sUm6MtwEvpsBbfLX8 one] of the three districts in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_County,_West_Virginia#Geography Clay County, WV].

He is looking to the left. Ponytail's last text in a gray frame is shown above his reply. Cueball sends Ponytail a screenshot of driving directions between two cities with four stops on the way. Each of the stops as well as the starting point are marked with a circle. A blue line connects the dots and the destination is marked with a red Google pin. The map beneath it is drawn with gray lines and outlines most of the mainland USA except for the western most part and the tip of Texas. The country boarders are drawn with thick gray lines and the US state boarders are drawn with thin gray lines. Some parts of Canada and Mexico are also included. The six destinations used in the direction is named, using normal black font, with the state or other specification written in gray text after the destination name.

He has turned to look straight out of the panel. He sends Ponytail another screenshot of driving directions with a similar map type as in the previous panel, but this time with only three destinations.
