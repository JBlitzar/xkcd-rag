The complexity and strength of ciphers varies, from {{w|one-time pads}} and (historically) {{w|enigma machine|Enigma}} as stronger and more complex, to {{w|substitution ciphers}} as some of the weakest and least complex, where each character is simply given a set different symbol to represent it in the cipher.\n\nThis comic uses a substitution cipher, where all the letters of the English Alphabet are represented using the letter \"A\", with different {{w|diacritical marks}} to define the differences. See details about the 25 marks in the [[#Trivia|Trivia section]] below. This kind of cipher is often used on a recreational basis by children or casual enthusiasts, the similarity of the letters increasing the obscurity of the content and the skill or technology required for use, but there is also significant impracticality, as not only are substitution ciphers the easiest to break, but also the similarities in the letters do make the cipher hard to read and easy to misread, and the detail in the diacritical marks makes it easy to draw the \"A\"s incorrectly or ambiguously, potentially leading to [[3003: Sandwich Helix|part of the message being lost]]. This was our experience in the comments section of this very article, where one person implemented translator functions alongside another person crafting a message that failed to translate. However, the logic behind the code is mostly visual similarity, and if attentive to connecting concepts between the Latin and scream cipher alphabet, it could be quickly learned and translated in a glance.\n\nIt's named \"Scream Cipher\" (as a pun on {{w|stream cipher}}s, commonly used in computing) because the written form of a scream is often a long string of As, possibly with some other characters at the beginning or the end (and often an exclamation point for emphasis), such as \"Yyaaaaaww!” or “Aaaaaah!\" or \"Aaaaaaagh!\". The name may or may not be a reference to IBM's {{w|Scream_(cipher)|Scream cipher}} published in 2002.\n\nIn the comic, [[Cueball]] texts the ciphered version for the plaintext \"HELLO\", and [[Megan]] responds with that for \"HI\". The title text deciphers to \"AAAAAA A SCARY MONSTER AAAAAAA!\", which would be a logical reason to actually scream. Another comic featuring all \"A\"s was [[2957: A Crossword Puzzle]]. Diacritics was also the main theme in [[1647: Diacritics]], was previously also mentioned in [[1209: Encoding]] and in [[1857: Emoji Movie]], where they have an important part of the pun, and is mentioned in one point of the list in [[1957: 2018 CVE List]].\n\n===Worked example===\nSay we want to encode \"Scream\" in the Scream Cipher. First we would need to split out word into the letters, so S, C, R, E, A, M. The first letter is S, so if we go to S in the table S is shown to become to Ã, C similarly becomes A̧, R becomes Ȃ, E corresponds to Á, A is the main letter so A is unchanged to A, and M becomes Ǎ. If we then write them again in order, we find SCREAM becomes ÃA̧ȂÁAǍ. To turn cipher text back into normal text, the process is repeated in reverse. To translate A̧ẢA̯A̰ÁȂ, we go to A̧ in the table and find A̧ becomes C. Ả similarly becomes I, A̯ becomes P, A̰ becomes H, Á becomes E, and Ȃ becomes R. If we write the letters in order, we see that A̧ẢA̯A̰ÁȂ becomes CIPHER.\n\nText can be automatically translated using any of the following community implimentations:\n* The first known translator hosted on [https://github.com/Reginald-Gillespie/ScreamCipher GitHub Pages].\n* A more bare-bones [https://github.com/matthewpwatkins/scream-cipher/ implementation] hosted on netlify.\n* A terminal [https://github.com/klanderfri/ScreamCipher/ implementation].\n\n===Full cipher guide===\nThe {{w|Unicode}} names of the characters in the cipher are as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Input !! colspan=3 | Substitution\n|-\n!

Appears similar to Ą (U+0104, A with ogonek) used in many language to denote a nasal a sound and in Polish to denote a nasal o sound; however, the two can be distinguished by the direction of the diacritic.\n|-\n| D || U+0044 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D || A̱ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+0331 COMBINING MACRON BELOW''' || Some see the lower bar as similar to the lower edge of the D.\n|-\n| E || U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E || {{w|Á}} || '''U+00C1 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE || Many words have an acute e, as in \"fiancé\".\n|-\n| F || U+0046 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F || A̮ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+032E COMBINING BREVE BELOW''' || The breve adds a second line to the A, much like how an F has two lines.\n|-\n| G || U+0047 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER G || A̋ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+030B COMBINING {{w|Double acute accent|DOUBLE ACUTE}} ACCENT''' || Adds two acutes to a letter<!-- this isn't an explanation as to \"why for 'G'?\", unlike others, but doing what I think is right to add...-->.\n|-\n| H || U+0048 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H || A̰ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+0330 COMBINING TILDE BELOW''' || The low tilde has horizontal ink in the middle that moves vertical toward the sides, like an H.\n|-\n| I || U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I || {{w|Ả}} || '''U+1EA2 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH HOOK ABOVE || The hook almost looks like half of a circle, and the lowercase letter I (i) has a circular shape (known as a tittle) above it.\n|-\n| J || U+004A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER J || A̓ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+0313 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE''' || The comma symbol looks like a small letter 'J' in some fonts\n|-\n| K || U+004B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K || Ạ || '''U+1EA0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DOT BELOW || <!--{{w|Dot (diacritic)}} is already linked, with DOT ABOVE-->\n|-\n| L || U+004C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L || {{w|Ă}} || '''U+0102 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH {{w|Breve|BREVE}} ||\n|-\n| M || U+004D LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M || Ǎ || '''U+01CD LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH {{w|caron|CARON}} || The top-centered caron is the same shape as the top center of the M.\n|-\n| N || U+004E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N || {{w|Â}} || '''U+00C2 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX || The lowercase letter 'n' also looks like a circumflex in some scripts. The circumflex peak mirrors the peak at the top left of the N.\n|-\n| O || U+004F LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O || {{w|Å}} || '''U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE || The symbol contains the letter 'O'. In Scandinavian languages like Swedish, this combination of 'O' and 'A' is a letter unto itself, mostly used in words where a long 'a' sound has acquired a more 'o'-like sound.\n|-\n| P || U+0050 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P || A̯ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+032F COMBINING INVERTED BREVE BELOW''' || Refer to R: P also has a curve at the top center, but is encoded with one below. \n|-\n| Q || U+0051 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Q || A̤ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+0324 COMBINING DIAERESIS BELOW''' || The two dots below the baseline reflect the two times Randall's Q touch the baseline. In the Orthographies of Spanish, Catalan, French and Galician, the grapheme 'qu' normally represents a single sound, before vowels 'e' and 'i'. In the few exceptions where the 'u' is pronounced, a diaeresis is added to it.\n|-\n| R || U+0052 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R || Ȃ || '''U+0202 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH {{w|Inverted breve|INVERTED BREVE}} ||\nThe inverted centered top curve mirrors the curve at the top center of an R.\n|-\n| S || U+0053 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S || {{w|Ã}} || '''U+00C3 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH TILDE || Tilde looks like a sideways 'S'.\n|-\n| T || U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T || {{w|Ā}} || '''U+0100 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH {{w|Macron (diacritic)|MACRON}} || The macron looks like the top horizontal line in the letter 'T'\n|-\n| U || U+0055 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U || {{w|Ä}} || '''U+00C4 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS || The {{wiktionary|trema#Noun|two dot mark}} is used in many words in languages like German, Finnish and Swedish, with 'Ä' used as in \"{{w|Die_Ärzte|Ärzte}}\". As a true {{wiktionary|diaeresis#Usage notes|diaresis}}, it often indicates a vowel that is distinct from neighbouring vowels, rather than part of a {{w|Digraph (orthography)|digraph}} or longer phoneme. As a modifier of the vowel itself, as with the germanic/nordic languages, it is more properly called an 'umlaut' and may change a back vowel into a front vowel, though the two terms are often used interchangably.\n|-\n| V || U+0056 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V || {{w|À}} || '''U+00C0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE || Grave has the letter 'V' in it, as well as being half of its shape.\n|-\n| W || U+0057 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER W || Ȁ || '''U+0200 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH {{w|Double grave accent|DOUBLE GRAVE}} || The letter 'W' is visually two copies of the letter 'V'\n|-\n| X || U+0058 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X || A̽ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+033D COMBINING X ABOVE''' || The symbol contains the letter 'X'.\n|-\n| Y || U+0059 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y || A̦ || U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, '''U+0326 COMBINING COMMA BELOW''' || The comma mimics the vertical \"tail\" of the Y.\n|-\n| Z || U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z || {{w|Saanich_dialect#Writing_system|Ⱥ}}<!--best link available?--> || '''U+023A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH STROKE || The stroke through the letter A resembles the diagonal stroke of a capital \"Z\"\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The top of the panel has the 26 letters of the alphabet written, each followed by a hyphen and the letter \"A\" with a unique diacritical mark for each. \"A - A\" is the only letter in the top row, and the only one where that A on the right side doesn't have a diacritic.
