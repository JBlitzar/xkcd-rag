This allows for fond nostalgia about the times when they were supposedly more intelligent and focused. For instance, Nicholas Carr wrote [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/ this article] to compile both anecdotes (which are more abundant) and research (which is more useful) to describe this phenomenon.\n\n[[Cueball]] does the same here, but [[Megan]] retorts that he spent six hours reading over a pointless (if disturbingly plausible) theory about a banal show based off a series of bedtime stories made to entertain small children. ''{{w|Thomas & Friends|Thomas The Tank Engine}}'' is a British children's series based off a series of books written by Wilbert Awdry. It follows the adventures of anthropomorphized train locomotives and other vehicles. \n\nCueball qualifies his statement: he has no attention span for anything good anymore. Megan, in reply, examines Cueball’s bookshelf, finding a book that cements Cueball’s status as a nerd who reads {{w|High fantasy|high fantasy}}. Cueball protests that the book is a classic, but Megan dismisses the fact.\n\nTo be fair to Cueball, many great fantasies have covers such as those in the comic (e.g. ''{{w|A Song of Ice and Fire}}'', ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings}}'', Randall's personal favorite ''{{w|Discworld}}''). To be fair to Megan, this book is apparently not one of them, being thicker than it is wide (like ''The Complete {{w|Miss Marple}}'' by {{w|Agatha Christie}}), a telltale sign of needless bombast and turgid prose.\n\nOther possibilities for the dragon book are ''{{w|His Majesty's Dragon}}'' from the ''{{w|Temeraire (series)|Temeraire}}'' series or ''{{w|Dragonsbane}}'' from the Winterlands series. \n\nIf there was any doubt about Cueball’s dubious literary tastes before, Megan dispels them in the title text, referring to a novelization of the excoriated movie ''{{w|Surf Ninjas}}'', a movie that is {{tvtropes|ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin|exactly what it sounds like}}. Despite the hyperbole, the ''Surf Ninjas'' novelization is [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/9792011 very much real], written by {{w|Peter Lerangis}} (under the pseudonym A. L. Singer); Lerangis would later move on from writing licensed works to his own original children's books and is now considered an accomplished author.\n\nThe comic contains a hyperlink to an article with the same unfortunate content Cueball has apparently finished reading prior to this comic: [https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-repressive-authoritarian-soul-of-thomas-the-tank-engine-and-friends The Repressive, Authoritarian Soul of “Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends”]. This article, the articles linked from it, further linked articles from those, links found by googling the topic, and other related [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5199/surfing-world-wide-web web surfing] on the topic could easily add up to six hours or more of reading.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are standing together.]\n:Cueball: I haven't read any books in forever. I have no attention span anymore.\n\n:[Zoom in on the faces of Cueball and Megan.]\n:Megan: Didn't you literally '''''just''''' spend six hours obsessively reading about the theory that ''Thomas the Tank Engine'' is authoritarian propaganda depicting a post-apocalyptic fascist dystopia?\n\n:[Cueball still standing there. Megan begins pacing away.]\n:Cueball: OK\n:Cueball: I mean I have no attention span for anything '''''good''''' anymore.\n:Megan: Let's check out your bookshelf, shall we?\n\n:[Cueball alone.]\n:Cueball: What are you-\n:Off-panel: I see a dragon holding a sword in its teeth on the cover of a book that's thicker than it is wide.\n:Cueball: And? That's a '''''classic!'''''\n:Off-panel: Just saying, I don't think this is a new development.\n\n==Trivia==\n2005 (the comic number) is also the year of the first xkcd comic.\n\nThe dragon described is very loosely similar to the legendary Pokémon {{w|Zacian}}, whose game had been teased at the release of this comic.\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
