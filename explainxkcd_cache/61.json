    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 61\n| date      = February 8, 2006\n| title     = Stacey's Dad\n| image     = staceys_dad.jpg\n| titletext = I bet she gets you to mow the lawn, doesn't she?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic refers to the song \"{{w|Stacy's Mom}}\" by {{w|Fountains of Wayne}} (see the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4 music video] on YouTube). In the song, the background singers repeatedly say, \"Stacy's mom has got it goin' on.\". The song is from the perspective of a young teenage boy who has a crush on his best friend's mother — 'Stacy's Mom' — and has deluded himself into thinking that she might like him back. In one verse, he tells Stacy \"I know that you think it's just a fantasy, but since your dad walked out your mom could use a guy like me,\" and this is the line the comic is referencing, with Stacy's dad (drawn the same way as [[Hairy]], making this his first appearance) directly echoing the line and explaining ''why'' he left Stacy's mom, suggesting that the singer do the same. \n\nThe line \"Stacy's mom has got it going on\" is repeated throughout the song, and in context simply means that Stacy's mom is very attractive. Here, however, Stacy's dad changes it, saying that she \"has a lot going on,\" which means that she has issues that would make a relationship difficult.\n\nThe humor comes from the fact that, in the song, it is very clear that the singer does not actually have a chance with Stacy's mom and is merely kidding himself, as he is still just a kid. But in the comic, Stacy's dad appears to be taking the situation completely seriously, and is worried enough about the possibility of Stacy's mom and the boy getting together that he feels the need to warn him away. Additional humor comes from the different meanings of Stacy's mom having a lot \"going on.\"\n\nThe title text is referencing the second verse, which begins: \"Stacy remember when I mowed your lawn.\" Mowing the lawn is the sort of chore that a kid might get paid to do for a friend's parent, and in the song, this is meant to emphasize that Stacy's mom sees the singer as a child, not as a potential partner. But here, Stacy's dad seems to be implying that mowing the lawn is something that Stacy's mom made him — and possibly all her previous partners — do for her, and so her getting the boy to do it ''is'' actually a sign that she is interested in him.\n\nThe song ''Stacy's Mom'' was again referenced in [[575: Tag Combination]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A hairy man.]\n:Man: Look, I know you think that since I walked out she could use a guy like you.
