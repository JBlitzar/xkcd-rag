Most people know how to use email to send files through the internet, but (as of 2011 when this comic was published) 25&nbsp;MB exceeds the attachment size limit of most email services. The reason there is a limit is because every email has to be transferred between several mail transfer agents, and each one has to temporarily store a copy of the email. Space constraints on those mail servers means that they must impose size limits, and an email with such a large attachment will therefore not be delivered.\n\nThe next option is to upload the file to an FTP server (FTP stands for {{w|File Transfer Protocol}}, as opposed to HTTP, {{w|Hypertext Transfer Protocol}}), used to transfer files between computers on a shared network, such as the internet. However, FTP servers are a touch more esoteric than a mere email attachment, and many internet users don't have access to one of their own.\n\nWeb hosting is simply the ability to create a website and store all the data for said website on a server which is connected to the internet. If Cueball's friend's cousin had the ability to do that, sharing the file would be as easy as putting a copy of it in an accessible directory and sending the link to the desired recipient.\n\n{{w|Megaupload}} was one of many sites on the Internet that recognized most users' inability to host large files on their own, and so offers to host large files, sometimes for free, sometimes for a small fee. The payoff is that in order to make such a service profitable, many of these sites are cluttered with banner and pop up ads in a mad effort to squeeze as much ad revenue out of every page view as possible. It's not a dealbreaker for some, but Cueball seems to think it'll be too much for his friend's cousin to handle.\n\n{{w|AOL Instant Messenger|AIM}} Direct Connect was a file sharing system on AOL Instant Messenger, which was already suffering severe drops in popularity by the year 2000. Clearly, Cueball is grasping at straws here: anybody desperate enough to invoke the name of AOL as a solution instead of a problem must be at their wits' end.\n\n{{w|Dropbox (service)|Dropbox}} is a program with a web-based GUI that automates file sharing between two computers on the internet. But this solution also has its issues, as it requires that at least the sending party has a Dropbox account. Installing Dropbox software is not actually required, since Dropbox also provides a web interface for uploading and downloading files. At the time of the comic's publication, Dropbox was still relatively new and unknown, thus why it is not Cueball's first suggestion.\n\nWhile Cueball is still explaining Dropbox, the friend's cousin has copied the file to a USB drive and physically transported it to the friend's house, circumventing the Internet entirely. It's not an elegant solution, but sometimes traditional methods are the most efficient ways to get something done.\n\nWhen used to transfer files between computers in the same room or building, this same approach is referred to as {{w|sneakernet}}. This comic is also an illustration of what {{w|Andy Tanenbaum}} said in 1989: ''Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway.'' Sneakernet was examined in this [https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/ What If] article.\n\n{{w|Tim Berners-Lee}} developed the HTTP protocol, the {{w|HTML}} markup language and the first web browser. Therefore he is considered to be the inventor of the World Wide Web. He envisioned originally an interactive web, where it would have been possible for the users to change a website directly using the browser, which would have made it possible to upload a file directly to a webpage:\n\n:<q>Tim Berners-Lee's original vision of the Web involved a medium for both reading and writing. In fact, Berners-Lee's first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, could both view and edit web pages</q> (from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WebDAV&oldid=1006182171 WebDAV]).\n\nIn contrast to this, a static web (\"Web 1.0\") came alive, which developed then later to the interactive \"Web 2.0\" we know today. Wikis like [[Main Page| this website]], where the page content is editable via forms, are a perfect example for this \"emulated interactivity\". From the technical point of view, the webpage is still static and the browser is just a viewer for html pages with the limited possibility to send some form data to the server. Scripts on the server, which process this form data, then change the web page. This mechanism is a more complicated work-around for what Tim Berners-Lee originally planned.\nDropbox and the web interfaces of email providers are further examples of this \"emulated interactivity\". The title text assumes, that Tim Berners-Lee feels probably generally sad, that his invention developed into this unnecessary complicated way and misusing emails (maybe even via the web interface of email providers) for file sharing is therefore especially painful for what could have been so simple.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands near a computer, talking on the phone to another person.]\n\n:Cueball: You want your cousin to send you a file? easy. He can email it to- ...Oh, it's 25 MB? Hmm...\n:Cueball: Do either of you have an FTP server? No, right.\n:Cueball: If you had web hosting, you could upload it...\n:Cueball: Hm. We could try one of those MegaShareUpload sites, but they're flaky and full of delays and porn popups.\n:Cueball: How about AIM Direct Connect? Anyone still use that?\n:Cueball: Oh, wait, Dropbox! It's this recent startup from a few years back that syncs folders between computers. You just need to make an account, install the-\n:Cueball: Oh, he just drove over to your house with a USB drive?\n:Cueball: Uh, cool, that works too.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I like how we've had the internet for decades, yet \"sending files\" is something early adopters are still figuring out how to do.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic has a resemblance to both [[1810: Chat Systems]] and [[2194: How to Send a File]]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Email]]"
