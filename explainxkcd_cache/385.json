When a guy does something wrong, it's his own mistake. When a girl does something wrong, it is taken as a confirmation that girls are inferior.\n\nThe mathematics displayed is neither {{w|semantically}} nor {{w|syntactically}} correct. To begin with, there should (reasonably) be a ''dx'' after x<sup>2</sup>. Adding this, we have an {{w|indefinite integral}} on the left hand side.\n\nThe answer given in the title text, {{w|π}} + C, is just nonsensical: What we want is a {{w|Function (mathematics)|function}} whose {{w|derivative}} is x<sup>2</sup>. Now, x<sup>3</sup>/3 satisfies this condition. However, since adding a {{w|constant (mathematics)|constant}} to a function does not change its derivative, the full answer is (any function of the form) x<sup>3</sup>/3 {{w|Constant of integration|+ C}}, where C is any fixed number. The \"plus a constant\" part is very easy to forget, and might even be omitted by a (sloppy) professional mathematician. So if someone really gave the answer π, \"you forgot to add a constant\" would be a pretty funny remark, because in one way it's true, but on the other hand it wouldn't quite be the main thing to worry about. (It is especially inane as π itself ''is'' a constant, and so adding another arbitrary constant makes the π irrelevant.)\n\nIt would also be possible to fix the equation by adding [http://www.mathwords.com/b/bounds_of_integration.htm bounds of integration], so that {{w|π}} becomes the area below a section of the curve x<sup>2</sup>. That is called a definite integral, and there would be no \"+ C\". The bounds would have to be somewhat awkward though; if 0 was the lower bound, the cube root of 3π would have to be the upper.\n\nA more complicated but not entirely unlikely guess is that the equation is meant to represent the {{w|Gaussian Integral}}, &nbsp; \n<sub>-&infin; </sub>&int;<sup> +&infin;</sup> ''e''<sup>-x<sup>2</sup></sup> ''dx'' = &radic;&pi; . \n&nbsp;\nHowever, the person writing only vaguely remembers this identity, and even forgets about basics like adding ''dx'' and the bounds of integration. This would indeed support the view that the person sucks at math. \nThe correction/improvement attempted in the title text is just the average student's first guess when asked to reconsider an equation where the bounds of integration are missing. If the situation is actually about said integral, this is no proof of competence either. \n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and a friend stand at a blackboard. The friend is writing, in standard mathematical notation, that the integral of x squared equals pi. No differential or bounds are given for the integral.]\n:Cueball: Wow, you suck at math.\n:[The same scene, except the writer is Megan.]\n:Cueball: Wow, girls suck at math.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Math]]"
