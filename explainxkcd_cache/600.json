Now, [[Ponytail]] has decided she would also like to have an {{w|android (robot)|android}} boyfriend ([[Hairy]]). But upon bringing these two androids together, they fall for each other and decide to have \"sex\" on the spot, resulting in several mechanical sounds off-panel while their \"owners\" watch on with disgusted interest.\n\n{{w|vibrator (sex toy)|Vibrator}}s and {{w|fleshlight}}s are sex toys that represent male and female genitalia, respectively. Ponytail's flat description indicates that she is not particularly aroused by what amounts to a pair of animatronic sex toys rubbing against each other. [[Randall|Randall's]] title text claims that he has actually done such a thing, and stuck it on his fireplace mantle for all his house-guests to see. He admits though that it is ''the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house.'' References to fleshlights is a [[:Category:Fleshlights|recurring theme]] in xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail enters from the right dragging Hairy along by his hand, as she moves towards Cueball who stands with Megan in his hand.]\n:Ponytail: I thought your android girlfriend was cool so I got myself an android boyfriend.\n\n:[Suddenly the Megan android runs into the arms of the Hairy android, while Ponytail has let go of his hand. Ponytails head swirls around to follow her run by.]\n:Ponytail: He's really great. I like howâ€”\n:Ponytail: Uh.\n\n:[Cueball and Ponytail look towards the two androids, but they are now outside this frame-less panel.]\n:Off-panel sound: ''*Zip*''\n:Off-panel voice: ''Mmmmm''\n\n:[Cueball and Ponytail still look at the scene off panel.]\n:Cueball: ...Huh.\n:Ponytail: It's like somebody stuck a vibrator in a fleshlight.\n:Off-panel sound: ''Whirrr''\n:Off-panel voice: ''Mmmm''\n:Off-panel sound: ''Click''\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the comic six years before [[1541: Voice]], in which Ponytail stated that she could only control her voice once every six years.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Fleshlights]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Android Partner]]"
