The 3D view is still available at [https://3d.xkcd.com/ 3d.xkcd.com] for all comics prior to this one.\n\nThe previous April Fools' Day comic was literally [[404: Not Found]]. After this comic, Randall began releasing April Fools' Day comics every year, disregarding the weekday of that date. The next was [[1037: Umwelt]] released on Sunday April 1st 2012, the first to use another day of the week than Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. Some people suffer from headaches, eyestrain, motion sickness and other problems when watching {{w|3D film|3D movies}}, playing 3D games, watching {{w|3D television}}, playing hand-held {{w|Nintendo 3DS}}, etc.\n\nIn this comic, Cueball is using the excuse that 3D gives him a headache to get out of going outside into the real world, where ''everything'' is in {{w|Three-dimensional space|3D}}. Instead he stays inside and looks at his 2D computer monitor. In the title text, he says he will only go to flat places (i.e. places where everything he could see would be 2D-like). In his [https://vimeo.com/78912850 Ã˜redev 2013 talk] [[Randall]] mentions that a few of his friends created this 3D view and told him just 1.5 hours before the scheduled comic for that day would go live. [[Randall]] quickly drew a 3D themed comic to match.\n\nThe title text suggests that Cueball is only comfortable seeing objects with visible flat surfaces like flat movie and TV screens (which the entertainment industry would not call \"3D\").\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan has a bike, and is wearing a helmet. Cueball is at a computer.]\n:Megan: Wanna go for a bike ride?\n:Cueball: Nah, I hate 3D stuff. It gives me a headache.\n:When you think about it, this excuse can get you out of almost anything.\n\n==Trivia==\nWhen clicking the 'next' or 'latest' buttons on the xk3d site, a blue {{w|Utah teapot}} appears, in random locations and sizes, instead of proceeding.  Attempting to proceed beyond via manually pointing the URL elsewhere is not supported.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Interactive comics]]\n[[Category:Dynamic comics]]"
