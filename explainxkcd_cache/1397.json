In the movie Vader notes that Luke Skywalker has constructed a new {{w|lightsaber}} following the loss of his [[wikia:c:starwars:Luke skywalker#Lightsabers|original]] during their [[wikia:c:starwars:Duel on Cloud City|duel on Cloud City]], Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber actually having been the second lightsaber of {{w|Anakin Skywalker}}, who later turned into Darth Vader. \n\nIn this comic, however, Darth Vader has accidentally discovered his son's {{w|fleshlight}} (a male {{w|sex toy}} designed to imitate one of various orifices, most commonly a vagina), which he apparently brought with him on the [[wikia:c:starwars:Battle of Endor#The ground assault|attack]] on the {{w|Endor (Star Wars)|Forest Moon of Endor}}. [https://youtu.be/Z8uDQuWlnww?t=71 From a certain point of view], a fleshlight could be mistaken for the handle of a lightsaber, without the blade extended. Like many teenagers, Luke Skywalker is attempting to hide evidence of his sexual activity from a parent. References to fleshlights are a [[:Category:Fleshlights|recurring theme]] in xkcd.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that if Darth Vader turned the fleshlight on, instead of creating a blade of pure plasma or energy suspended in a force containment field the device would simply vibrate, revealing it for what it really is. [[Randall]] is also punning on \"being turned on\" as slang for being sexually aroused.\n\nIn a later comic another version of this scene is displayed in [[1433: Lightsaber]]. This time not so embarrassing for Luke, but much more dangerous. In that comic Luke should really have said \"Don't turn it on\".\n\nIn [[1637: Salt Mine]], [[Ponytail]] makes a very similar remark to the one that Luke makes here.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Darth Vader is holding up what appears to be the handle of a powered-down lightsaber looking down at it while talking to Luke Skywalker, drawn with thin hair hanging down his forehead.]\n:Darth Vader: '''''I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.'''''\n:Luke Skywalker: ...Yes. \n:Luke Skywalker: That is definitely what I did.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Vader finds Luke's Fleshlight.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Star Wars]]\n[[Category:Fleshlights]]"
