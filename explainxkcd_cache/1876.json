The other comics are [[1877: Eclipse Science]], [[1878: Earth Orbital Diagram]], [[1879: Eclipse Birds]], and [[1880: Eclipse Review]].\n\n[[Cueball]] comes to tell [[Megan]] about a cool map showing that searches on Google on the word Eclipse trace the same path across the USA as the totality band does, implying that those living in the zone are more interested than the rest of the US population.\n\nThe \"[https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2017/08/eclipse.png cool map]\" is hosted by ''{{w|The Washington Post}}'' and sourced from {{w|Google Trends}} data. The link shown in the comic is here: [http://wapo.st/2vkgIBv wapo.st/2vkgIBv] (subscription required);  an archived version is available [https://web.archive.org/web/20170814171105/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/01/the-path-of-the-solar-eclipse-is-already-altering-real-world-behavior/ here] at archive.org\n\nSince the eclipse searches are outpacing the {{w|2016 United States elections|2016 election}} searches now, this is saying the eclipse popularity is going to rocket upwards just before the eclipse. Cueball is thus warned by Megan that the extreme amount of social media interest in the eclipse may lead to massive traffic jams, as last days frenzy regarding the eclipse will cause an enormous amount of people to decide to go to the eclipse in the last moment, causing huge traffic jams. (These traffic jams may be analogous to long lines at the polls or traffic jams caused by people trying to get to the polls.) Also as soon as people driving on the freeway enters the totality zone it has been seen happening that people just stop their cars and get out blocking the roads.  This time also the eclipse-viewers will wish to post their content on the social media which might also cause a cyber traffic jam, in which users may find that they experience delays in sending or receiving data due to a high demand on telecommunications infrastructure. Megan tells Cueball to bring water if he is on the road during the totality, the implication being that people who are on the road may be stuck in their vehicles for long periods of time, and thus need refreshments.\n\nIn the graph charting interest in the {{w|United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election}}, November 8 is an important date as it was the day the election was held. August 21, 2017 refers to the date of the then upcoming solar eclipse.\n\nThe title text refers to the total eclipses from {{w|Solar eclipse of March 7, 1970|1970}} and {{w|Solar eclipse of February 26, 1979|1979}} which were also visible in the US, but both only for a few states. The traffic jams will be worse than those caused by previous eclipses, as we did not have viral social media in the 1970s, and also much less traffic on the roads.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball walks up to Megan while holding his smartphone up in his hand. Megan sits in an office chair in front of her desk with an open laptop on it. She turns her head towards him. A footnote to Cueball's speech is at the bottom right of the panel.]\n:Cueball: Have you seen this cool map* showing how Google searches for \"eclipse\" trace the eclipse's path?\n:Megan: Yeah!\n:Megan: But you know what else I noticed?\n:Cueball: What?\n:Footnote: *wapo.st/2vkgIBv\n\n:[Two panels are on top of each other. In the smaller top panel a colored graph is shown with a blue growing graph and a steeper growing red graph above it. Both are labeled. The x-axis (a black line) has labels and arrows below it in red and blue to indicate time periods. Text above the graph:]\n:Searches for \"eclipse\" in the weeks before the eclipse are outpacing searches for \"election\" in the weeks before the 2016 election.\n:Red line: <font color=\"red\">Eclipse</font>\n:Blue line: <font color=\"blue\">Election</font>\n:Red x-axis labels: <font color=\"red\">2017 →|← July →|← August → </font>\n:Blue x-axis labels: <font color=\"blue\">2016 - September →|← October →|← </font>\n\n:[Behind the top panel is a second larger panel slightly lower end more to the right. The visible part at the bottom of this panel is showing the same line graphs with the one from the election going past the election day. The x-axis labels ranges over a later time. The blue graph has a huge peak at the election day, visible in the part of the panel to the right of the top panel) and this date is written in a blue dot on the label. Similar the date of the Eclipse is written in a red dot. The red graph above the blue still ends in dots before the expected peak, as it is in the future.]\n:Red line: <font color=\"red\">Eclipse</font>\n:Blue line: <font color=\"blue\">Election</font>\n:Red x-axis labels: <font color=\"red\">2017 - July →|← August 21 → </font>\n:Blue x-axis labels: <font color=\"blue\">2016 - October →|← November 8 → </font>\n\n:[Megan with her hands on the laptop and Cueball are both looking at the laptop. Beat panel.]\n\n:[Cueball stands again and Megan has taken her hands down from the laptop.]\n:Cueball: This is gonna be bad, isn't it?\n:Megan: If you're planning to be on the road next Monday, bring water.\n\n==Trivia==\n*This is the second reference to the Eclipse within a month, the first was in [[1868: Eclipse Flights]]. The 2017 eclipse was mentioned as early as 2013 in the title text of [[1302: Year in Review]]. And this years ''New Year'' comic [[1779: 2017]] also mentions it. Both comics joking in the title text that it may be canceled or not happening.\n*It was the first time in about four months [[Randall]] made a reference about the presidential election from 2016, compared to several comics released withing the first half year after the election, with some kind of relation to the election.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Total Solar Eclipse 2017]]\n[[Category:Footnotes]]\n[[Category:Solar eclipses]]"
