Recently, {{w|IBM}} has extended Watson to act as a {{w|clinical decision support system}}, using image analytics to aid {{w|physicians}} in medical decision making. In this comic, [[Randall]] uses a {{w|flowchart}} (as he [[:Category:Flowcharts|often does]]) to represent a guide to the algorithm used by Watson, including bizarre and horrifying techniques including surgical alteration of a patient to match a height and weight chart or squeezing the patient to make sure fluids come out of them. Like [[416: Zealous Autoconfig]], this comic pokes fun at a rigid, poorly-designed setup that ends up potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nModern {{w|medicine}} involves both standard processes and clinical judgment based around years of advanced training. An algorithm like this would have to be incredibly complicated in order to simulate the clinical judgment of a good doctor. However, some procedures are not normally used, and some would obviously cause damage.{{Citation needed}} Below is a [[#Explaination of steps|detailed description of each step]], but here is a list of some of the more strange steps:\n*The algorithm depicted treats a patient as more of a machine or mechanical system than a living being, especially through decisions such as:\n**Injecting oxygen into patients with low {{w|Oxygen saturation (medicine)|oxygen saturation}}, rather than administering an oxygen mask or treating the root cause.\n**Removing and inspecting a skeleton, then diagnosing the patient's condition with a bone count. This is likely a reference to [http://buttersafe.com/2015/10/15/a-serious-case-of-spookiness/ A  Serious Case Of Spookiness] from the [http://buttersafe.com/ Buttersafe] web-comic, a comic Randall links to from below the comics on {{xkcd}}.\n***In the book ''[[Thing Explainer]]'' there is an explanation ''Colors of light'' for the electromagnetic spectrum, where [[Ponytail]] as a doctor looks at a full body x-ray of [[Cueball]] and exclaims that ''... It looks like your body is full of bones'' to which Cueball replies ''Oh no! Is there any cure?'' Well if he meets Watson he might have them all removed... This comic came out about a month after the book so it may be viewed as a kind of reference to the problem with too many bones.\n**{{w|Dissecting}} a doctor \"for parts\" after consulting them for advice.\n**Removing extra limbs from a patient if the count is 100 or more (This might be a reference to different number systems used in computers, as 100 is read in binary as four.)\n**Determining whether the \"build environment\" of the patient is sane. This is most probably a reference to the {{w|configure script}} used in the {{w|GNU_build_system|GNU build system}}, which emits \"checking whether build environment is sane\" as one of its status messages. This is also referenced in [[371: Compiler Complaint]].\n**Rinsing the whole patient with a {{w|Saline (medicine)|saline solution}}.\n**Removing organs from a patient regardless of response to an {{w|organ donation}} request.\n*Other decisions appear to be entirely unrelated to the conditions upon which they are predicated:\n**If the patient doesn't rate their {{w|Pain scale|pain on a scale}} from 0-10, {{w|Genome project|sequence their genome}}, apply a {{w|tourniquet}}, and perform an {{w|autopsy}}\n**If the patient's phone's battery is low, {{w|Defibrillation|defibrillate}} until the battery is charged, sync photos, then administer general anesthesia\n**If the patient is successfully comforted after an oxygen injection, check their medical history and apply {{w|Skin grafting|skin grafts}}\n**If green fluid is released from the patient, begin to {{w|Cauterization|cauterize}}\n**If the patient has less than 100 limbs, check their {{w|Vitamin D}} level\n\nAlthough there are two options where the patient is {{w|Inpatient_care#Planning_for_patient_discharge|discharged}} the patient should be very lucky to make it to one alive. The only survivable route requires the patient to be injecting with oxygen, which is typically lethal. The patient would also experience multiple unnecessary operations, which hopefully do not last long enough for their vitamin D levels or their phone battery to decrease significantly. The option at the bottom left is only reached after your skeleton is removed (and nothing is mentioned about putting it back, even if that would help). \n\nThe other discharge option is to the right, three boxes down, and can only be reached if you survive having an oxygen saturation of less than 50 % (less than 80-90 % can be a serious problem, see [[#Explanation of steps|table below]]), and a very dangerous oxygen injection. Then you have to have a skin graft and a good D vitamin level. It is also best that you have a fully charged phone else you will be subject to defibrillation (which may very likely kill you, if it will continue until your phone is charged to above \"low\" level - which is probably not even possible). You can also reach this discharge option another way, but that would only be after your organs were removed... But if you get through this you could reach the discharged option alive. Sadly there is a little glitch mentioned in the title text:\n\nThe title text implies that, if the patient is so lucky to ever reach one of the two places with the option \"discharge patient\", a minor glitch will cause the program to go back to the ''hunt down and capture patient'' option which thus force the patient and the program to repeat the process again in an infinite cycle, that will only end once the patient give another rating than 0-10 of their pain level on the 0-10 scale. Then the program will start to sequence their genome, then apply a tourniquet and finally perform an autopsy on what will, in the end, for certain be a deceased patient; but maybe the patient was still alive when the autopsy began. This will finally cause the patient to leave the cycle as a corpse. If the patient dies before giving a different option, the machine could get stuck, as it will never receive any answer to the pain level question. It could also get stuck trying to charge the patients phone battery by defibrillation.\n\nOne potential way to survive is to keep answering “nine” on the pain level question. Another possible exit would be spitting, drooling or sweating enough to register in the \"fluid coming out of patient\" stage while not bleeding or having snot fall out, causing the algorithm to freeze due to not having a response for clear liquids.\nThis is the second comic in a row about health issues with the last comic being [[1618: Cold Medicine]].\n\n===Explanation of steps===\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|   | <b >Step</b>\n|   | <b >Medically valid?</b>\n|   | <b >Conditions and following step</b>\n|-\n|   |\nDraw Blood\n|  |\nPhlebotomy is a normal early step in the diagnostic process, but not as first and unconditional step\n|   |\nRecord patient’s name\n|-\n|   |\nRecord patient’s name\n|  |\nIdeally done before a robot is involved, but not an abnormal step\n|   |\nMeasure Patient’s height and Weight\n|-\n|   |\nMeasure Patient’s height and Weight\n|   |\nOK\n|     |\nConsult Standard height/weight chart\n|-\n|   |\nConsult Standard height/weight chart\n|     |\nOK\n|     |\nSurgically adjust patient to match\n|-\n|   |\nSurgically adjust patient to match\n|     |\nMay be considered ethically dubious unless there are [http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/medical-information/procedures-and-treatments/limb-length-difference-and-limb-lengthening sound medical reasons] for doing so.

How significant a problem depends on where the fluid came from and if it is supposed to be coming from there. Red generally is due to blood, yellow is due to pus/tissue fluid/lymph and green signifies bacterial infection or bile salts (biliverdin). Could also relate to normal fluids being lost (e.g. urine, saliva, sweat)\n|     |\nNo: Squeeze patient\n|-\n|   |\nYes: What color?\n|-\n|   |\nSqueeze patient\n|     |\nCould be in the medical context, as in providing external ventilation (see iron lung) or some means of removing fluid (e.g. squeezing pus from a boil).\n|     |\nIs fluid coming out of patient\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=4  |\nWhat color?\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=4    |\nNever underestimate the number of different types of fluid the body can produce.

Presumably a reference to how much cleaning up will be required by this stage.  Or, since this occurs when fluids are black, the black fluids might indicate that there are ashes or charred tissue, indicate that the patient has caught on fire and sprinklers are needed to extinguish the fire.\n|     |\nSubdue patient\n|-\n|   |\nSubdue patient\n|     |\nPotentially very important if patient is behaving dangerously to themselves and others around them (due to mental health issues e.g. psychosis or drugs) and/or is moving too much to be given treatment. This would be likely due to what happened earlier.\n|     |\nApply cream\n|-\n|   |\nApply cream\n|     |\nMedically valid as a form of barrier dressing to improve wound healing.\n|     |\nAsk patient to rate pain level\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=4  |\nAsk patient to rate pain level\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=4  |\nUseful in the sense that it provides the doctor with the means to ensure that the patient is receiving adequate analgesia during conditions of chronic and acute pain.\n|     |\n0-8: Massage scalp\n|-\n|     |\n9: Admit for observation\n|-\n|     |\n10: Laser eye removal\n|-\n|     |\nOther response: Sequence genome\n|-\n|   |\nMassage scalp\n|     |\nThis would belong more to the domain of palliative care and reflexology rather than being an accepted medical treatment.\n|     |\nPatient is healthy\n|-\n|   |\nPatient is healthy\n|     |\nA subjective assessment of the health patient is often helpful in ruling out certain diagnoses. For example, one is less likely to suspect cancer in a fit, healthy 30 year old than a thin, lethargic 50 year old.\n|     |\nAdmit for observation\n|-\n|   |\nAdmit for observation\n|     |\nUseful in the context of 'watchful waiting', in which the doctor may be unsure if the patient actually has a condition that they suspect that the patient has. By keeping the patient on the ward for a few days, the clinician can monitor the progression of symptoms and rapidly initiate adequate treatment if medically warranted.\n|     |\nAsk patient to rate pain level\n|-\n|   |\nLaser eye removal\n|     |\nThis is not a standard medical procedure, and not a good idea.  This is a reference to [[1681: Laser Products]]. At least in animal surgery, however,  laser eye removal [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK0NYUtoqk does exist].\n|     |\nAdmit for observation\n|-\n|   |\nSequence genome\n|     |\nUseful in the association of extremely rare point mutations with an organic illness. See for instance the Genome 10K Project or the Cancer Genome Atlas. Or in diagnosing extremely rare mutations that are not picked up by most commercial DNA screening tests (e.g. kidney failure due to INF2 mutation).\n|     |\nApply tourniquet\n|-\n|   |\nApply tourniquet\n|     |\nUseful to stop acute bleeding from an injured extremity, but if it is drawn too tightly it can cause neuromuscular damage.\n|     |\nPerform autopsy\n|-\n|   |\nPerform autopsy\n|     | The patient has died, and Watson is being ordered to determine the cause of death. Note that the only way to reach this state is from \"apply tourniquet\", implying the cause of death is strangulation via tourniquet.\n|     | END STATE (taking the title text into account, the only possible one)\n|-\n|   |\nCauterize\n|   |\nCauterizing is done with a heated instrument or a chemical to burn the skin or flesh of (a wound), typically to stop bleeding or prevent the wound from becoming infected. This could be useful if there is an open wound, but can cause tissue damage and other complications.\n|   |\nAsk patient to rate pain level\n|-\n|   |\nInject oxygen\n|     |\nMay be fatal as injecting gases directly to the blood vessels can cause a serious embolism if it blocks blood flow to the brain or coronary arteries. However, if the oxygen is injected slowly into the venous circulation, it may be survivable as the bubbles may simply collect in the lungs where the oxygen is then slowly reabsorbed into the blood.\n|     |\nComfort patient\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nComfort patient\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nPsychological support to the patient and relatives is often useful after breaking news of a poor prognosis.

Probably a little late to be noticing this now.\n|     |\nFewer than 100: Measure Vitamin D\n|-\n|     |\n100+: Remove extra limbs\n|-\n|   |\nRemove extra limbs\n|     |\nMedically indicated in cases of polymelia either due to cosmetic purposes or because the extra limbs pose a direct threat to the health of the baby.\n|     |\nSubdue patient\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nMeasure vitamin D\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nValid in diagnosis of bone related issues, for example if multiple or comminuted fractures were being counted as additional limbs/bones.\n|     |\nGood: Check whether build environment is sane\n|-\n|     |\nBad: Blood loss?\n|-\n|   |\nCheck whether build environment is sane\n|     |\nCould be technical reference to the installation of the algorithm in the robot, or could relate to the sanity of:\n*The robot doctor\n*The patient undergoing this procedure (before or after reaching this part of the process)\n*[[Black Hat|The person]] who programmed the robot to perform this flowchart\n*[[Black Hat|The person]] who allowed this state of affairs to occur\n\nThis could also be a reference to the title text for [[371: Compiler Complaint]].\n\nNB: Whether the build environment is sane is irrelevant to the flowchart.\n|     |\nRinse patient with saline solution\n|-\n|   |\nRinse patient with saline solution\n|     |\nTepid sponging may be indicated if the patient has a high fever. Could also refer to internally rinsing patient with saline solution i.e. providing intravenous sodium chloride to boost circulating volume or to perform peritoneal dialysis.\n|     |\nIs patient phone battery low?\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nIs patient phone battery low?\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nInvalid in medical terminology, could be a technological metaphor for the patient's consciousness or stamina. \"Your life-force is running out\"\n|     |\nYes: Defibrillate\n|-\n|     |\nNo: Sync photos from camera\n|-\n|   |\nDefibrillate\n|     |\nIndicated in cases where there is ventricular fibrillation, and to a lesser extent in other heart rhythm disorders, but would not help with a phone.\n|     |\nIs patient phone battery low?\n|-\n|   | \nSync photos from camera\n|     |\nDefinitely invalid. Could refer to the robot attempting to backup photos from a camera before attempting to repair it/attempting to back-up patient's consciousness.\n|     |\nAdminister general anesthesia\n|-\n|   |\nAdminister general anesthesia\n|     |\nValid, but not at this stage. Only used when the procedure will invoke unnecessary distress or pain to the patient if they were to be awake beforehand. This also has the implication that no anesthesia has been applied beforehand. This implication means the patient has likely been subject to unnecessary pain which is ethically dubious.\n|     |\nDischarge patient (right)\n|-\n|   |\nDischarge patient (right)\n|     |\nAcceptable in general, but the patient would most likely be dead in both cases as life is not possible without organs, and general anesthesia often requires mechanical ventilation to support breathing.\n|     |\nEND STATE (before you read the title text)\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nBlood loss?\n| width=\"33%\" rowspan=2  |\nUseful.

With some serious lifestyle modifications, the pancreas, pituitary gland, frontal lobe of brain, half of the brain, second kidney, adrenal glands, bladder, and most of the gut can be removed. The heart can be removed from the body and replaced with an artificial pump for a few months at the most. However, such organ removals are only indicated if there is a genuine clinical need to do so due to the non-negligible risk of death associated with these operations.\n|    Discharge patient

Watson would remove the extra limbs if you had less than 100 limbs, while in the corrected version, he would remove them only if you had more than 100. This actually opened up (a slim) chance to survive to the right discharge patient box. However, according to the title text, it wouldn’t matter in the end. \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Flowcharts]]\n[[Category:Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]\n[[Category:Medicine]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
