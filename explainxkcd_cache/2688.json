Meanwhile, ''regular'' inflation refers to blowing bubbles, as this leads to them being inflated.{{Citation needed}} This comic \"unified\"  these theories with the simple proposition that the universe was a bubble and inflated like regular bubbles do. Unification of theories is a popular goal among scientists, since it makes it possible to provide a single explanation for multiple phenomena.\n\nSee also [[2972: Helium Synthesis]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball blowing expanding bubbles. In the largest one is a whole new universe with another Cueball blowing similar bubbles. The bubbles are progressively darker: the first ones are regular transparent/white bubbles, and as they grow, they turn gray then dark, to match the black night sky, with stars, galaxies, planets and other astronomical bodies] \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Recursion]]"
