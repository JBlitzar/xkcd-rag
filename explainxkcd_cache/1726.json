On the distant bank two other engineers are arguing, with gestures, in presumably a heated manner (probably about where to place a third sign, lying next to them on the bank, to make it behave a certain way)\n\nAs rivers flow according to the landscape, this plan will not work and the river will continue on its course. Cueball is very frustrated by this and is still trying to make the river obey the traffic laws. The caption lays out the punchline: The comic compares the useless approach of Cueball attempting to divert a flowing, moving river with fixed signs that do nothing, with the {{w|Unicode Consortium}}'s attempt to define the diverse and ever-changing human language with strict technical standards.\n\n{{w|Unicode}} is a largely successful attempt to have a standard for representing all possible letters, numerals, digits and symbols that make up human writing in all languages.  This includes the roman letters used in this article, characters with modifiers like ê (both with the common characters as well as the modifiers selectable separately), logographic characters like in Chinese, syllabic writing system like Japanese, right-to-left and/or top-to-bottom writing systems, mathematical symbols and many other writing systems. \n\n{{w|Emoji}}, one of the trendier and newer Unicode blocks, are also referenced in the title text (see below). The symbols on the signs in the river are real road signs, but interestingly enough they also both exist in Unicode, with the warning sign triangle with an exclamation mark ⚠ having [http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/26a0/index.htm code (U+26A0)] and the black, rightwards arrow ➡ having [http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/27a1/index.htm code (U+27A1)].  As can be imagined, coping with the wide variety of character sizes, orientations, ways they can be modified, capitalization rules, etc. can get to be very challenging as the Unicode Consortium tries to write rules that accommodate how printed language is actually used. Emoji have become a [[:Category:Emoji|recurrent theme]] on xkcd.\n\nThe title text refers to [http://unicode.org/L2/L2016/16072-jurassic-emoji.pdf a proposal] to add three dinosaur heads to the official list of emoji.\n\nThis is likely to stir a glorious internet argument between a half-dozen opposing (and {{w|pedantic}}) camps that may now be brought together, such as the following:\n*Those who favor the inclusion of more emoji vs. those who oppose emoji on principle.\n*Those who accept the existence of ''{{w|Brontosaurus}}'' vs. those who deny its status as a genus unique from ''{{w|Apatosaurus}}''.\n**[[Randall]] has made it clear what he believes in [[636: Brontosaurus]].\n**Although it seems new development has occurred since the release of that comic, suggesting that ''Brontosaurus'' is a specific genus. But that is still debated...\n*Those who favor a traditional, scaly image of dinosaurs vs. those who have accepted the feathered-dinosaur paradigm.\n*Those who want ''Brontosaurus'' depicted as an ordinary or shrinkwrapped sauropod vs. Those who want it depicted with extra soft tissue, especially the heavy neck padding thought to be used for elephant-seal-like duels (the \"Brontosmash\" hypothesis).\n*Those who prefer a different dinosaur species be included instead.\n*Those who oppose about the possible inclusion of pterodactyls, which are not considered to be dinosaurs.\n*Those who point out that two of the dinosaurs in the \"Jurassic Emoji\" set actually come from the {{w|Cretaceous period}}, and as such renaming is necessary vs. those who think that \"{{w|Jurassic}}\" is a cooler word (because of the {{w|Jurassic Park}} movies).\n*Those who will use it as a generic emoji for dinosaurs vs. those who insist it ''must'' be used for brontosauruses only.\n\nSee also this [http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2016-m08/0103.html discussion about this comic on the Unicode mailinglist]...\n\nHighway engineers were also the subject of [[253: Highway Engineer Pranks]] and [[781: Ahead Stop]]. Unicode was also the subject of [[1953: The History of Unicode]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in a river close to its right bank, the water reaching up to his thighs. He is holding on to a traffic sign standing towards right. It has a label and an arrow below this pointing to the right bank. With his other arm he is pointing to the left at the advancing water masses. Further up the river is another street sign this sign has an exclamation mark inside a triangle. The water flow is indicated with several lines on the river surface, mainly moving along the river, but around Cueball and the signs there are circular lines. In the distance on the left bank of the river two people are standing and making gestures with raised arms. The left has white hair (could be either sex) and the other is a second Cueball. A third sign is lying on the ground to the left of them face down. Behind them is a slope up to a road with a parked car. The road continues out over a bridge that crosses the river. The river which passes under it both left and right of a central pillar. At that distance the right bank of the river (and thus the right end of the bridge) is not visible, being outside the panel. On each river bank grass can be seen and on the right bank also a small stone.]\n:Cueball: No, go ''this'' way, not-\n:Cueball: Are you even ''listening!?''\n:Cueball: ... ''Hey! That's not what that area is for!''\n:Sign with arrow: Detour\n:Sign with triangle: !\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Watching the Unicode people try to govern the infinite chaos of human language with consistent technical standards is like watching highway engineers try to steer a river using traffic signs.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Apatosaurus]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]\n[[Category:Unicode]]\n[[Category:Engineering]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]"
