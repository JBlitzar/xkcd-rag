The last panel reveals a joke about {{w|Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner}}, a cartoon series created by {{w|Chuck Jones}}. In the cartoon, the Coyote is constantly building odd contraptions (with parts ordered from the {{w|Acme Corporation}}) to catch the Road Runner. The Coyote never succeeds, often because his devices don't work as intended.\n\nThe word {{w|Hubris}} from the comic title means extreme pride or arrogance. It is a theme from the classic Greek plays, and is usually severely punished by the gods.  The title text is implying that Chuck Jones would not let hubris go unpunished; the engineer might be able to construct 'better' traps than Wile E, but they would still be doomed to fail.\n\nFrom the second panel, [https://catb.org/jargon/html/M/Murphys-Law.html| Murphy's Law] can be simplified to \"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\" It was originally developed as a guideline for accident prevention starting at the design level. In the common vernacular today, it is interpreted more liberally: \"If there is even the slightest chance of an unfortunate accident occurring, despite all your attempts to prevent it, the accident will happen anyway, purely out of spite.\" The namesake {{w|Edward A. Murphy Jr.}} has since evolved to mythic proportions, being cast as a vengeful god of misfortune and ruin.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[This comic is illustrated in color.
