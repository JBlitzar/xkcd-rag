The planned attack was for two planes to collide with the north and south towers simultaneously, but what ended up happening was that [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g6V8KZE3GA&t=35s plane 1 hit the north tower at 8:46 am], and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KYE4zViAAg&t=11m44s the second plane hit the south tower a little less than 20 minutes later]. In the ensuing investigation many people raised questions that didn't seem to get a satisfactory answer for several months, if not years. Many people, who called themselves {{w|9/11 Truthers}}, began to claim that the whole thing was a government conspiracy, in what has come to be known as the \"controlled demolition plot\" (referenced by the title of this comic), which alleges that the towers were brought down not by the fires caused by the planes but by demolition charges intentionally placed there by the government.\n\n[[Cueball]] proposes a compromise for both those who believe in the conspiracy and those who don't. Since there is only a government related video of a plane flying into the north tower — done by a man who was with {{w|FDNY}} fire fighters — it's easy for Cueball to assume that was a government conspiracy. He proposes there was no north tower plane at all, it was faked by the government and planted with the FDNY, and the tower was brought down with controlled demolition. In contrast there is ''plenty'' of footage of the plane flying into the south tower, thanks to news reporters and handheld cameras trying to get shots of the burning north tower, so Cueball finds the evidence of a terrorist attack on the south tower perfectly reasonable and doesn't try to explain it away. He simply posits that the terrorist attack and government conspiracy were running simultaneously by a weird coincidence.\n\nThe title text is a restatement of the {{w|Argument_to_moderation|Golden Mean fallacy}}: that the truth can be found in a compromise between two opposite positions. In this comic, one of the positions is a fanciful conspiracy theory and the other is a sober fact-based conclusion.  The error of this fallacy is apparent here, as it can lead  to even more ridiculous conclusions. In this case, the compromise theory would make no one happy because both sides would have to concede claims which they have already dismissed as bogus, as well as accept an incredibly unlikely coincidence.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, ''{{w|The_Onion|The Onion}}'', a satirical news site, reported that the government has confirmed Cueball's theory by releasing an article titled, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170210142430/https://www.theonion.com/article/government-admits-it-was-only-behind-destruction-o-37699 Government Admits It Was Only Behind Destruction Of North Tower.]\n\nThis is one of the [[:Category:Compromise|compromises]] Cueball (or Randall) has proposed, most of which will also be unlikely to be accepted...\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding up a pointer to a screen with an image of the World Trade Center towers mid-disaster.]\n:Cueball: Based on my analysis, I believe the government faked the plane crash and demolished the WTC north tower with explosives.\n:Cueball: The south tower, in a simultaneous but unrelated plot, was brought down by actual terrorists.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:The 9/11 truthers responded poorly to my compromise theory.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Compromise]]\n[[Category:Conspiracy theory]]\n[[Category:9/11]]"
