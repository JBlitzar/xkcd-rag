The Pauli exclusion principle, from which the pun is derived, states that no two electrons (or indeed any {{w|fermion}}) can occupy the same atomic state. Therefore, any electron orbital is limited to two electrons: one with a &frac12; spin, and the other with a &minus;&frac12; spin. The Aufbau principle states that lower energy orbitals are occupied previous to high energy orbitals. Hund's rule states that electrons will try to fill orbitals individually, and only pair up when every orbital has a lone electron in it. \n\nIn the comic, electrons are being equated to people, and rooms (or couches) are equated to orbitals. The reverse of Hund's rule is then followed: people will try to pair up in a room first, and only when all the couples have done so will rooms be allocated to single people. The Pauli exclusion principle here means that only two people can occupy a room at a time (should those people be romantically involved), as most people are generally uncomfortable being in a room with people engaging in intercourse.{{Citation needed}} The Aufbau principle therefore means that more restful rooms are filled previous to less restful rooms. \n\nThe title text jokes about drunken party-goers, who ignore the Pauli principle perhaps out of {{w|inebriation}}. They then end up partying and sleeping together with many people in the living room, leaving the roommate stuck in the third desirable location, the hall lounge.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding up a pointer in front of a diagram of a dorm apartment. On the diagram, there are two connected pairs of dots in each bedroom, and one dot on the couch.]\n:Cueball: Thus, once all the dorm bedrooms are occupied by romantic pairs, additional roommates are forced into less restful \"living room couch\" orbitals.\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:The Pauli Sexclusion Principle\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
