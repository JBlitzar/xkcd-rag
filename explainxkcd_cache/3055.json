The three categories are giants from space, 'geological' features called giants and giants who have been proven to be fictional. In the central overlap of all categories is a possible 'giant', fulfilling all groupings, but normally ''without'' the word \"giant\" in its name.\n\nVenn diagrams and Euler diagrams are the subject of numerous XKCDs, including [[112: Baring My Heart]], [[773: University Website]], [[1180: Virus Venn Diagram]] [[2122: Size Venn Diagram]], [[2721: Euler Diagrams]], [[2769: Overlapping Circles]], [[2903: Earth/Venus Venn Diagram]], [[2962: President Venn Diagram]], and various others.\n\n; {{w|Red giant|Red Giant}} (Space)\n\n: A type of large, relatively cool star.\n\n; {{w|Blue giant|Blue Giant}} (Space)\n\n: An early type of large, relatively hot star.\n\n; Iron Giant (Space, Not Real)\n\n: Title character from a {{w|The Iron Giant|1999 animated film}} and the {{w|The Iron Man (novel)|1968 children's book}} it was based on (written by English poet and author {{w|Ted Hughes}} and published outside the US as ''The Iron Man: A Children's Story in Five Nights'') : a robot from outer space.\n\n; Frost Giant (Not Real)\n\n: Beings from Norse mythology, Frost Giants also appear in Marvel comic/film versions.\n\n; Jolly Green Giant (Not Real)\n\n: A mascot for a {{w|Green Giant|brand of canned vegetables}}.\n\n; {{w|Cardiff Giant}} (Geologic/Planetary, Not Real)\n\n: An 1869 archaeological hoax of a supposed petrified giant man.\n\n; {{w|Atacama Giant}} (Geologic/Planetary)\n\n: A prehistoric {{w|geoglyph}} in the {{w|Atacama Desert}}.\n\n; {{w|Paratethys#Salt Giants|Salt Giant}} (Geologic/Planetary)\n\n: A huge salt deposit below the Mediterranean sea.\n\n; {{w|Gas giant|Gas Giant}} (Space, Geologic/Planetary)\n\n: A large gaseous planet, like Jupiter or Saturn.\n\n; {{w|Ice giant|Ice Giant}} (Space, Geologic/Planetary)\n\n: A relatively large icy planet, like Uranus or Neptune.\n\n; {{w|Man in the Moon|The Man In The Moon}} (Space, Geologic/Planetary, Not Real)\n\n: A 'face' visible in the near side of the Moon, sometimes shown as a character in children's nursery rhymes. As a feature, it is real, but not a 'real'<!-- somehow resolve this with Atacama==real(created) yet Cardiff==unreal(created)? --> giant, only an instance of {{w|pareidolia}}.\n\n; {{w|Flemish Giant rabbit|Flemish Giant}} (title text) (Real, but Randall suspects it belongs in Not Real)\n\n: One of the largest breeds of domestic [[1682: Bun|buns]], about the same size as a {{w|Cocker Spaniel}} dog. This means it is a very low-ranking one.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:Types of Giant\n\n:[A Venn diagram with three categories: In space, Geologic/Planetary, Not real]\n:[Only in \"In space\": Red, Blue]\n:[Only in \"Geologic/Planetary\": Atacama, Salt]\n:[Only in \"Not real\": Frost, Jolly green]\n:[Both in \"In space\" and \"Geologic/Planetary\": Gas, Ice]\n:[Both in \"In space\" and \"Not real\": Iron]\n:[Both in \"Geologic/Planetary\" and Not real\": Cardiff]\n:[In all three: [The man in the Moon]]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Venn diagrams]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Buns]]"
