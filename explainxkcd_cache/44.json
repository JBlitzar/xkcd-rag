The previous one was [[21: Kepler]], and the next one was [[40: Light]].\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic expresses the view of a love that is unbalanced and unequal. And how one form of love can be painful when closely examined. It is customary for people in a romantic relationship, when one makes a declaration of love or affection, for the other to make a matching declaration. However, instead of continuing [[Cueball]]'s escalation by saying the expected response \"I love you ''more''!\", [[Megan]] stops and agrees with him: he does in fact love her more than she loves him. This leads to an uncomfortable dynamic in the relationship, and the final frame shows the couple awkwardly standing in silence.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] expresses how this comic is shockingly stark in its portrayal of love.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]\n:Cueball: I love you!\n:Megan: I love you!\n\n:[Same scene as before.]\n:Cueball: I love you more!\n:Megan: Yeah.\n\n:[Beat panel.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis used to be one of the [[Footer comics|footer comics]] featured in the bottom segment of [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com].<!--\n\nEDITORS: THIS IS NOT THE LAST COMIC TO BE DRAWN ON CHECKERED PAPER.
