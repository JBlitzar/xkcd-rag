It behaves like energy; if it is an energy, it contributes 68% of the total energy in the present-day {{w|observable universe}}. \n* The {{w|deep biosphere}} resides below the first few meters of the ground down to at least 10 and 21 km below the continental and sea surfaces respectively. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the biomass across two of the three domains of life, {{w|Archaea}} and {{w|Bacteria}}. \n* {{w|Parasitoid wasp}}s lay their eggs on or in the bodies of other {{w|arthropod}}s, sooner or later causing the death of these hosts. They are a huge group, with the subgroup of {{w|Chalcidoidea}} alone comprising an estimated 500,000 species.\n\nThe three categories listed in the comic are not random examples of obscure-sounding scientific knowledge; the terms themselves each have a subtle and clever double meaning for what counts as \"obscure\" knowledge:\n* The adjective \"dark\" can also describe a situation notable for a paucity of knowledge, as in the \"{{w|Middle Ages|dark ages}}\" or the \"{{w|dark web}}\", just like the \"dark energy\" form of energy is little known by the layperson.\n* The adjective \"subsurface\" connotes a world below the surface, just as laypeople are unaware of the world of biomass below the everyday surface of common knowledge. It's a similar metaphor to phrases like \"sub rosa\" — literally \"under the rose\" — and “undercover,” which refer to actions done in secret.\n* Parasitoid wasps act covertly; their larvae can grow inside an insect — like a caterpillar — secretly, with no clear indication that the innards of the caterpillar are being slowly replaced with a wasp larva, similar to the hidden nature of this giant class of insects to the common layperson.\n\nThe title text jokingly wraps these three examples together.\n\n===Evidence for this phenomenon in science news===\nAccording to the [https://www.science.org/content/article/scienceadviser-scientists-are-publishing-too-many-papers-and-s-bad-science American Association for the Advancement of Science], nearly 3 million scientific research papers were published in 2022, the latest year for which numbers are conveniently available. A tiny percentage of these studies find their way to \"general news\" outlets, which, according to a [https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2017/09/20/general-news-outlets-are-the-most-common-science-news-source-most-seen-stories-highlight-discoveries-and-weird-findings/ 2017 report by the Pew Charitable Trust], are the principal sources of science news for non-scientists. According to that same report, \"general news\" sources preferentially cover scientific research findings that make \"newsworthy\" discoveries, are \"weird\", or have \"human interest\" dimensions such as disagreements among celebrity scientists. There is also a bias towards certain topics, such as health and medicine. Consequently, vast domains of \"science space\" go unreported by general news, and hence are unknown to the general public.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A pie chart, with a very slim section in the upper left is shown.
