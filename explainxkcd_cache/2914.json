A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Sun and the Earth, but in order for it to be a total eclipse, the Sun, Moon and the observer's position on the Earth need to line up nearly exactly, and at the right distances (if the Moon is too far away, the eclipse will be annular, rather than total). When such a phenomenon occurs, there's a \"path of totality\", referring to the range of locations where such an alignment occurs (though only for a few minutes in each location). Away from, but near to, the path of totality (and outside of the specific time of totality), the Moon partially obscures the Sun. In Boston, where [[Randall]] lives, the Sun will be 93% obscured at the local peak of the eclipse.\n\nThe comic refers to the fact that the human eye is very good at adapting to different levels of light intensity. At 95% occlusion, it's noticeably dimmer outside, but the effect is similar to light in late evening, or on a heavily overcast day, nothing particularly remarkable. Using eclipse glasses (or a simple pinhole camera), it's possible to see the Sun being occluded, but someone unaware that an eclipse was occurring would barely notice that anything was happening. \n\nWithin the path of totality, it's a different situation. Though an eclipse for any given locale could be experienced at all times from dawn to dusk, the most dramatic ones will occur somewhere around the middle of the observer's day. When the Moon fully obscures the Sun, for a brief period of time, the area becomes almost fully dark without the usual or expected {{wiktionary|crepuscular}} transition. Temperatures drop noticeably in a matter of minutes and wildlife (and people) may react in [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/us/solar-eclipse-animals-pets-zoo.html unusual ways]. The level of light in the rest of the sky is similar to that which accompanies a sunset, but in all directions and without the horizon's red light effect. Most dramatically, the previously unseeable Sun's upper atmosphere can be viewed, as a ring around the dark circle of the Moon, with the naked eye (which should ''only'' be possible once the bright solar disc is obscured, and until it starts to appear again). At the very limits of totality, though perhaps most dramatic at its ending, the smallest sections of the bright solar surface will briefly be the only parts to shine through low points on the Moon's edge to form {{w|Baily's beads}}, or a \"diamond ring\" effect, not at all visible beyond the narrow central strip of the eclipse.\n\nThe graph in this strip points out that the difference between 91% (or even a 99%) eclipse and a total eclipse is dramatic. An almost total eclipse is barely noticeable, while a total eclipse is a visual phenomenon unlike any other. This is a situation where being close to the path of totality and being on it makes a huge difference. \n\nForbes made a similar reference to total solar eclipses being only worthwhile seeing if in the direct path of 100% totality, with a [https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ef95bf101386371bff5839/2024-04-08-TSE-regional-FUNNY-copy/0x0.png \"map of nope\"]. The map shows all of North America that's not directly in the 100% path of totality as \"Nope/Nada\" meaning that anyone in those areas won't experience the full \"OMG!\" experience of the total solar eclipse. The [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/19/why-every-american-needs-to-see-the-map-of-nope-meme-before-april-8s-total-solar-eclipse/?sh=2aab9ab55725 article] mentions hotels may claim to be close enough to the eclipse with \"nonsensical oxymorons like '99% coverage of the full total eclipse'\" and that it is common for people to think: \"I'm happy to avoid the traffic and settle for 95%'\".\n\nThe title text simply emphasises the point of the comic - the significant difference between a partial and a total eclipse. It is unclear whether the claim is that a partial eclipse is really 'like' a sunset, while a total eclipse seems like someone broke the sky — claims which would be hyperbolic — or if the intention is to say that the comparison between a partial and total eclipse is equivalent to the comparison between a cool sunset and a broken sky.\n\nRandall has earlier made [[:Category:Total Solar Eclipse 2017|many comics]] about the 2017 total solar eclipse, such as [[1876: Eclipse Searches]] through [[1880: Eclipse Review]] and [[2816: Types of Solar Eclipse]]. Randall and his wife also made plans to see the 2024 eclipse in [[1928: Seven Years]].\n\nAdditionally, the graph appears similar to a {{w|Dirac delta function|Dirac delta distribution}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph is shown with a curve starting from zero a bit from the left of the Y-axis and from there staying almost at the same height just above the X-axis from left to right, where it again goes to zero a bit from the right end of the X-axis. That is except at the very center of the graph, where the line peaks going to a point high above the top of the Y-axis. An arrow is pointing up on the top of the Y-axis and this axis has a label to the left. The X-axis has no label or arrow, but there are three segments beneath it, two large left and right of the peak and a very small in the middle just under the peak. The two large segments has a double arrow pointing from the two lines at the left and right of their segments, and in the middle of these arrow there are labels. Beneath these segments there is another label with an arrow pointing to the gap between the lines of the two long segments. At the top left of the graph there is a large header with a sub header beneath:]\n:<big>How cool a solar eclipse looks</big>\n:by position along the path\n\n:Y-axis: Coolness\n:Label beneath X-axis left : Partial eclipse zone\n:Label beneath X-axis center: Path of totality\n:Label beneath X-axis right : Partial eclipse zone\n\n:[Two small dots representing people are drawn a bit to the right of the path of totality zone. Star bursts above these indicate they are speaking with their text shown above them:]\n:Left person: We should have a good view here - we're pretty close to the middle of the path.\n:Right person: Yeah, this map says the sun will be 91% eclipsed!\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was released on April 1st and marks the second year in a row that [[Randall]]'s [[April Fools' Day comics|April Fools' Day comic]] appeared delayed. It is the first time a release day has fallen on April 1st without Randall making any note of it, and not since 2009 has there been a comic released on April 1st without it being an April Fools' Day comic. The same year, however, he found another way to make an April Fools' Day joke. For 2024, the release of [[2916: Machine]], in Friday's 5/April comic slot, seems to fulfil the expected April appearance of a 'special comic'.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Solar eclipses]]"
