In other words, this comic is also poking fun at hipsters. \n\nThe title text refers to the controversy of calling the ''{{w|Brontosaurus}}'' by its newer, correct (at the time) {{w|Binomial nomenclature|generic name}} of ''{{w|Apatosaurus}}'', despite its previous name still being in mainstream use long after its {{w|Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic}} redefinition in 1903. (As of 2015, ''Brontosaurus'' is once again the correct generic name, as it has been reclassified as a distinct {{w|Genus|genus}}.) The title text claims that this renaming has \"jumped the ichthyosaur,\" which is a play on the idiom \"{{w|jumping the shark}}\" â€” i.e. that the subject of dinosaurs has reached a point of declining relevance, and ''Brontosaurus'' has been renamed as a publicity stunt to compensate. The \"{{w|Shark|shark}}\" in the idiom has been replaced by an \"''{{w|Ichthyosaur}}'',\" which was a marine reptile that resembled a shark or dolphin and lived alongside dinosaurs during the {{w|Mesozoic}} era (although sharks also lived during that time). [[636: Brontosaurus]] also references the ''Brontosaurus'' name change. A ''Brontosaurus''  also appears in [[15: Just Alerting You]] and an ''Apatosaurus'' in [[650: Nowhere]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Ponytail in a museum, near a reconstructed dinosaur fossil and a display cabinet.]\n:Ponytail: Man, paleontology sucks these days.\n:Cueball: Why?\n:Ponytail: ''Jurassic Park'' came out 15 years ago.\n:Cueball: So?\n:Ponytail: Today's grad students got into dinosaurs after seeing it as kids. They don't care about fossils. Brats.\n:[A woman in a hat exploring a barren landscape.]\n:Ponytail: Before they had living dinosaurs handed to them by Hollywood, I was out in Texas digging up Arcocanthosaur teeth.\n:Cueball: So, you were into dinosaurs when they were still underground?\n:Ponytail: Exactly!\n\n==Trivia==\n*The word {{w|Acrocanthosaurus}} is misspelled in the third panel as \"'''arco'''canthosaur.\"  Assuming this isn't merely a spelling mistake on [[Randall]]'s part, Ponytail's incorrect pronunciation further undermines her self-proclaimed superiority over all the ''Jurassic Park''-inspired \"bandwagon\" palaeontologists.\n\n*Since the publication of this comic, the time since Jurassic Park came out has doubled to more than 30 years. \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Apatosaurus]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
