Irregardless.\n}}\n==Explanation==\nApparently, Randall hates some ridiculous neologisms. [[Cueball]] seems to be dictating a \"Tween bromance\" story or novel to [[Megan]], who is possibly typing it up. He is including all the words that get to Megan in a sequence. Megan is just annoyed and starts to shriek in rage and annoyance; considering Cueball keeps speaking more annoying words in the title text, that seems to have been the point.\n\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tween Tween]\" means a pre-adolescent. Portmanteau of ''teen'' and ''between'', specifically above the age of 9 (the last value not in the tens) and below the age of 13 (the first actual \"-teen\" number).\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bromance Bromance]\" means a close non-sexual friendship between two males. Portmanteau of ''brother'' and ''romance''.\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=guesstimate Guesstimate]\" means an estimate made with very little information. Portmanteau of ''guess'' and ''estimate''.\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frenemy Frenemy]\" means a friend who is also a rival. Portmanteau of ''friend'' and ''enemy''.\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yiff Yiff]\" is a word invented by the {{w|furry community}}. In most contexts it simply means \"copulate\", supposedly derived from the sound a fox makes during mating, and can refer to any form of sexual activity, including cybersex.\n*\"{{wiktionary|moist}}\" is an ordinary word, but one that many people find mildly creepy, especially in this context.\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=taint Taint]\" is the part between the genitals and the anus (the perineum) in slang.\n*\"{{w|Panties}}\" is a common term in the U.S. for women's underwear.\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=preggers Preggers]\" a slang term for being pregnant.\n*\"{{wiktionary|verbiage}}\" is a fairly new usage of an older word, meaning too many words used to explain a subject.\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=va-jay-jay Va-jay-jay]\" /vəˈjājā/ IPA /vəˈdʒeɪdʒeɪ/ is a way of saying \"vagina\".\n*\"[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Irregardless Irregardless]\" is a {{w|solecism}}. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0037-irregardless.htm Or perhaps this portmanteau.]\n\nSo, the full sentence roughly translates to: By my rough guess, my friend-slash-rival engaged in sexual activity so intensely that her wet perineum caused her underwear to become pregnant.\n\nThis is probably nonsensical, as clothing cannot bear children.{{Citation needed}}  It may also reflect Cueball’s intentional parody of writers who lack understanding of anatomy/basic reasoning.  However, at a stretch, the word “preggers” could be interpreted to refer to the rare, literal meaning of pregnant: full/filled.  By this logic, “her moist taint made her panties preggers” would simply be an unusual way to say “her underwear were filled up with liquid”.  But in that case: ew.\n\nLike this comic fills a sentence with (gross) neologisms, [[550: Density]] crams a sentence with memes.\n\nAccording to [[1485: Friendship]], Randall doesn't like the word ''bromance'' much either. Uncomfortable synonyms are also seen in [[1322: Winter]] and [[2352: Synonym Date]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[All of Cueball's lines are overlaid over the entire comic; the panels listed are merely the ones directly under each sentence fragment.]\n:[Cueball is standing smugly behind Megan, who is seated in front of a computer and typing.]\n:Cueball: By my guesstimate,\n\n:Cueball: my frenemy yiffed so hard\n\n:Cueball: her moist taint made\n:[Megan's eye twitches.]\n\n:Cueball: her panties preggers!\n:Megan: ''STOP IT STOP IT!''\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the first frame, the back of Megan's chair is missing.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Furries]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
