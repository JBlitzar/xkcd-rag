(blog)|''what if?'' blog]], and ''[[What If? (book)|What If?]]'' and ''[[What If? 2]]'' books. In particular, promoting [[Randall]]'s new book, ''What If? 2'', released 6 days after the comic's release. This comic has a list of things not to do, an extension of a previous list, and is purportedly things Randall discovered as he was doing research for his book. The page [[What If? chapters]] contains the titles, publishing date, thumbnail, question, and explanation for each article. Many of the acts described under the \"new\" section of the list are depicted in these thumbnails (see table below); others are references to examples or hypotheticals explored within the articles. The entries are all in order of their appearance in the book.  \n\nThe title text says that Randall is tempted to tell people that all the things in the book were things that he actually tried to do, not that he calculated the solutions for their problems. Many of the questions and answers in his new book are borderline impossible and/or fatal to attempt in real life.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Number !! Entry !! [[What If? chapters|''What If? 2'' chapter]] referenced !! Explanation\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | From existing list\n|-\n!156,812\n|Eat Tide Pods\n|N/A\n|{{w|Consumption of Tide Pods|Tide Pod}}s are a brand of laundry detergent sold in small packets (\"pods\") of water-soluble gel. Many children have tried to eat them, thinking them to be candy, and have had to go to the hospital to treat poisoning. In 2017 and 2018, a satirical \"challenge\" originated around eating Tide Pods. Eating them has resulted in many deaths, and can also harm the body in other ways, such as chemical burns.\n|-\n!156,813\n|Walk on stilts in a thunderstorm\n|N/A\n|Taller objects are more likely to be struck by lightning, so walking on stilts outdoors would increase the risk of death by electrocution. It would also presumably risk falling and injuring oneself that way, since the ground becomes wet in a rainstorm.\n|-\n!156,814\n|Set off fireworks at a gas station\n|N/A\n|This has the risk of potentially causing an explosion in the gas station, from the sparks of the fireworks. \n|-\n!156,815\n|Feed your cat treats that are the exact shape and texture of a human hand\n|N/A\n|This probably runs the risk of the cat learning that treats are in the shape of your hand, resulting in the cat attempting to eat your hand, instead of the cat treat. \n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | New!\n|-\n!156,816\n|Lean over a geyser vent and try to look down into it\n|''{{what if|2-8|Geyser}}''\n|Geysers shoot steam and hot water upward. If a person were to lean over the geyser and look down during an eruption, they would be struck in the face by this hot liquid and gas mixture and severely injured or killed.[https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/geysers-hot-springs/cautionary-tale/] This is a reference to the question from ''[[What If? 2]]'' called, appropriately enough, ''{{what if|2-8|Geyser}}'', in which it is asked what might happen to a person if they stood on top of the Old Faithful geyser as it erupted.\n|-\n!156,817\n|Fly a hot-air balloon over a firing range\n|''{{what if|81|Catch!}}''\n|A hot air balloon could present an irresistible target to the people firing their weapons at the range. The balloon could be shot and you could fall to your death. Shooting bullets up and over the designated backstop and berm is also a public danger to anyone past downrange.\n|-\n!156,818\n|Peel away the Earth's crust\n|''{{what if|2-13|Lose Weight the Slow and Incredibly Difficult Way}}''\n|Theoretically, because weight is dependent on gravity, peeling the Earth's crust away would reduce its mass and therefore your weight. However, this would not work because the Earth gets denser the farther you go down. It would also destroy the Earth. An image of what it would look like is shown in [[2575: What If? 2]], where a potato peeler is used to remove the crust of the Earth. Several What If blog posts also result in massive damage to the Earth's crust, including what happened to Texas {{what if|153|here}}. \n|-\n!156,819\n|Try to paint the Sahara Desert by hand\n|''{{what if|84|Paint the Earth}}''\n|This would be difficult. There's not enough paint to cover the Earth's land, and — at this rate — probably won't be enough until the year 2100. But there ''may'' have been enough to cover the United States, which is almost as large as the entire Sahara.\n|-\n!156,820\n|Remove someone's bones without asking\n|''{{what if|2-18.5|Short Answers #2}}''\n|A reference to {{what if|2-18.5|this ''Short Answers question''}} in ''[[What If? 2]]''. This will result in getting arrested plus the person probably gets severely injured.\n|-\n!156,821\n|Spend 100% of your government's budget on mobile game in-app purchases\n|''{{what if|108|Expensive Shoebox}}''\n|A reference to one of the examples listed in {{what if|108|the answer to a question}} in the book. This will obviously cause economic problems.\n|-\n!156,822\n|Fill a lava lamp with actual lava\n|''{{what if|122|Lava Lamp}}''\n|A {{w|lava lamp}} is a glass lamp, which contains a wax mixture inside, and heats so that the wax rises and falls. Putting actual lava inside a regular lava lamp would make the container would glow opaque from the heat, making it impossible to see the lava, which would solidify after a minute.\n|-\n!156,823\n|Drink the blood of someone with a viral hemorraghic{{asic}} fever\n|''{{what if|98|Blood Alcohol}}''\n|Drinking someone else's blood is a bad idea unless you are a vampire bat/vampire, and even then it is not a very nutritious diet. If someone has a {{w|viral hemorrhagic fever}}, it is much worse, as they have a very serious and likely deadly disease which can be transmitted by sharing bodily fluids, such as blood. Drinking blood is the theme of this answer. Randall teaches us that drinking blood would induce vomiting, and would be a VERY bad idea.\n|-\n!156,824\n|Eat meat from rabid animals\n|''{{what if|2-46.5|Short Answers #4}}''\n|This references {{what if|2-46.5|this ''Short Answers question''}} in ''[[What If? 2]]''. Eating meat from rabid animals could give you {{w|rabies}}, a virus which is nearly always fatal if not treated prior to the appearance of initial symptoms. Pathogen contamination in cooked foods can persist on the surface of, ''e.g.'', tongs, chopsticks or a fork used to grill, which is why the USDA doesn't generally allow kitchen utensils to touch raw or ready to eat foods at all. Exceptions for utensils which touch only raw or partially cooked foods, such as grill spatulas and the like, are often allowed and can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis when they would otherwise be prohibited. The rabies virus permeates essentially all nerve tissue before symptoms appear.\n|-\n!156,825\n|Perform your own laser eye surgery\n|''{{what if|2-49|Eyeball}}''\n|Refers to {{what if|2-49|this answer in the book}} regarding seeing your own eyeball as well as the end of {{what if|82|this answer}}. This will probably result in eye damage.\n|-\n!156,826\n|Tell California poultry regulators that your farm is selling Pokémon eggs\n|''{{what if|2-52|Read All the Laws}}''\n|While issuing false statements to government regulators is a violation of both California and Federal law, for which prison sentences can reach ten years and fines can reach ten thousand dollars plus any compensatory damages, as per [https://california.public.law/codes/ca_penal_code_section_132 California Penal Code § 132] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001 18 U.S. Code § 1001], there is some question about whether any competent regulatory authority would ever take such an assertion seriously, and whether they would be liable for greater damages for doing so than the potential liability of the original culprit involved. Actually doing this, even to county level regulators, could result in a series of events very disadvantageous to you, your farm and your employees. However, declaring that you're producing Pokémon eggs to your local municipality is probably harmless, and likely to brighten the day of your local regulators.{{Citation needed}} Furthermore, as mentioned in ''What If? 2'', [https://california.public.law/codes/ca_food_and_agric_code_section_27637 California Food and Agricultural Code § 27637] bars anyone from making false or misleading statements about eggs, and Poké Balls could be considered a type of egg.\n|-\n!156,827\n|Funnel the entire flow of Niagara Falls into the open window of a physics lab\n|''{{what if|147|Niagara Straw}}''\n|An oblique reference to the image near the end of this answer which resulted into the destruction of Earth.\n|-\n!156,828\n|Pump ammonia into your abdomen\n|''{{what if|2-57|Ammonia Tube}}''\n|{{w|Ammonia}} is an {{w|EPA list of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance}} and pumping it into your abdomen would result in a painful death due to ammonia toxicity. As the book mentions, however, at the very least some of it would be neutralized with your stomach acid.\n|-\n!156,829\n|Suspend yourself inside a 10-meter ball of sunscreen and fall into the Sun\n|''{{what if|2-62|Sunscreen}}''\n|Despite its name, sunscreen only protects against some types of radiation from the Sun. No amount is going to be adequate protection if you are right inside the Sun. Also, sunscreen, being a gel, would evaporate when exposed to vacuum. When exposed to the plasma of the coronal surface or the Sun's interior, it would quickly ionize along with anything inside it, becoming plasma like the rest of the Sun.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Caption:]\n:Updates to my \"Things You Should Not Do\" list, based on what I learned writing ''What If? 2''\n:(out 9/13, xkcd.com/whatif2)\n\n:[The rest of the text appears in a box.]\n\n:<big>Things You Should Not Do</big><br />\n:(part 3647 of ????)\n\n:[A numbered list, the first four items in a lighter grey]\n\n:<nowiki>#156,812 Eat Tide pods</nowiki>\n:<nowiki>#156,813 Walk on stilts in a thunderstorm</nowiki>\n:<nowiki>#156,814 Set off fireworks at a gas station</nowiki>\n:<nowiki>#156,815 Feed your cat treats that are the exact shape and texture of a human hand</nowiki>\n\n:[A horizontal divider with the text \"''New!''\" in the middle in black.
