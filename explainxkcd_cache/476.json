The chart gives a plot of the frequency that this occurs (for [[Randall]] here represented by the [[Cueball]] to the left) against the amount of time that passes before the error is discovered. It also implies that Randall's second relationship was in reality just a particularly long instance of this occurrence, suggesting that his 'partner' wasn't even aware of the relationship.\n\nThe title text is the continuation of the phone call, which involves a fictional conspiracy involving the then Chairman of the {{w|Federal Reserve}} {{w|Ben Bernanke}} and a {{w|crossbow}}.\n\nOn September 23, about a week after this comic, Randall posted a [https://blog.xkcd.com/2008/09/23/federal-reserve-skateboard-a-short-story/ short story] to his blog, featuring Ben Bernanke breaking into the Federal Reserve building with a crossbow.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:Sometimes my conversations with strangers go on for a while before I realize that they're talking on their phones.\n\n:[To the right above a graph, Cueball is standing next to a Cueball-like guy with a backpack.]\n:Guy with backpack: Hi!\n:Cueball: Hi.\n:Guy with backpack: What's up?\n:Cueball: Uh, not a lot...\n:Guy with backpack: Shit. Does Bernanke own a crossbow?\n\n:[To the left and below these two guys is a graph with the axis labelled. The graph looks parabolic towards the left-hand side, but as x approaches infinity, y approaches zero. A vertical dashed line runs through the graph, slightly to the right of the peak of the graph.  To the right of the dashed line, there is an arrow pointing to the right that is labelled. The x-axis has a broken scale, and to the right of the break, there is a very small increase in the graph that is parenthetically labelled with a small arrow.]\n:Y-axis: How Often This Happens\n:X-axis: Length of conversation\n:Arrow: Awkward Zone\n:Small arrow: (My Second Relationship)\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category: Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Crossbows]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring politicians]]\n[[Category:Phones]]"
