Yes, it was a little weird.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is another comic in the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby series]]. \"{{w|Said the actress to the bishop|That's what ''she'' said!}}\" is a phrase used in the US in response to an unintended sexual innuendo, similar to the UK phrase \"said the actress to the bishop.\" An example usage might look like the following:\n\n:'''A:''' (while putting together some furniture) I think this is too big.\n:'''B:''' That's what ''she'' said!\n\nIn this example, the innuendo is that A was referring to a furniture component (say, a bolt too large to fit into the hole that was drilled in the factory), but the phrase might also refer to a human penis. While popular for a while, the phrase is considered puerile and clich√© nowadays, so it isn't often used except in mockery. \n\nIn this case, no sexual innuendo is intended; instead, the phrase is used to maximize the ambiguity of the statement. {{w|Ambiguity}} is when a statement could mean more than one thing. In English, it is often created as a result of pronouns like \"he\" and \"they,\" which might potentially refer to many different things in context. Here, \"that's what ''she'' said!\" could mean several things, because \"that\" and \"she\" could refer to multiple parts of the sentence:\n\n*Some woman said the entire statement.\n*Some woman said \"I could've done what they claimed I did.\"\n*Some woman is part of the \"they\" that claimed something about some other woman.\n*Some woman reported that some unknown man doubts that another woman did something that other people claimed that the other woman (or yet another woman) did.\n\nAnother explanation would be that the intense grammatical ambiguity of the situation allows for any type of interpretation of the situation... even a more \"perverted\" interpretation. Taken more literally, the \"she\" in \"that's what ''she'' said!\" could be a hypothetical woman who is known for saying crazy things, thus the grammatically ambiguous statement reminds the speaker of this  hypothetical woman.\n\nThe title text turns this back around, saying that there ''is'' actually a sexual innuendo in the statement: apparently the girl in question said this during sex. Since all of these possibilities are highly unusual things to say during sex,{{Citation needed}} the observation in the second sentence is accurate.\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby: Using \"that's what ''she'' said\" only in the most grammatically ambiguous situations.\n:Friend: He doubts she could've done what they claimed she did.\n:Cueball: That's what ''she'' said!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
