(blog)|what if?]]'' blog and following his first what if book.\n\nThe entire comic (including the [[Header text#2022-01-31_-_What_if.3F_2|xkcd Header text]]) is a link to a [https://xkcd.com/what-if-2/ what if? 2: the book] page on {{xkcd}}.\n\nApart from promoting the book, the comic also explains why he ended up writing a sequel. After the first book came out Randall was flooded with ''what if?'' questions. Presumable mainly from his readers via e-mail, but his friends and families also started texting him with these questions. Some of these texts are displayed in the comic, but only partially, so none of the six question texts can be read. But where one might think that this would become tiresome, Randall instead tells the readers the opposite: \"Honestly, I love it.\"\n\nHe then continues to praise the quality of the questions, mentioning no less than nine examples of what the questions were about. And in the process ensures the reader that planets, including the Earth, will be destroyed multiple times in his new book. At the end he lets the readers know that some of the features of the first book, with short answer sections and disturbing questions (likely not answered), are also included in this book. \n\nHe also states that a few of his favorites from the [https://what-if.xkcd.com/ ''What If?'' site] site have been included, so it is not all new material. He includes his very last online ''What If?'' ({{what if|157|Earth-Moon Fire Pole}}) for instance, which was released on 2018-05-21, almost four years before this comic was released. Also, by the time the book is released, it will be almost four years and four months since the last article on ''What If?''\n\nThe final part of the comic is a picture of the book that both makes it clear when the book is released and how to preorder it.\n\nRandall ensured the maximum possible attention to his announcement by placing a [[Countdown in header text|countdown]] in the [[Header text#2022-01-10_-_Standard_text_with_countdown|header]] about three weeks prior to the announcement. This has caused a lot of speculation as to what would be revealed on the day of this comic's release 2022-01-31. The timer was inside a panel at the top right of the xkcd header text next to the standard header text: ''xkcd updates every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday''. Inside the panel a picture began emerging after the first day, but the picture only changed approximately once every four hours. After a few weeks was it certain that it was a plane that was being revealed. And on the second to last day, around day twenty, it was clear that it featured a ''T. rex''-like dinosaur ''en silhouette'' standing on top of the aircraft, apparently trying to eat its way into the fuselage, and it might have been possible to guess the relation to the ''What If?'' sequel. On the day before the announcement on xkcd, however, [[Countdown_in_header_text#Blow_up_by_Amazon|Amazon made visible a preorder page for the book]], so the answer was made clear about a day before Randall had intended. This clearly annoyed users of this page as can be seen in the [[Talk:Countdown_in_header_text|talk page for the countdown]].\n\nUntil then, however, there were numerous [[Countdown_in_header_text#Theories|theories]] about the [[Countdown_in_header_text#Countdown|countdown]] and what the [[Countdown_in_header_text#The_picture|image would reveal]] as the image gradually changed throughout the eventual [[Countdown_in_header_text/images|136 frames]].\n\nIn the title text, Randall feels that he must clarify the release day (as in [[2562: Formatting Meeting]]), since he has often joked about the way different countries (and people) write dates. He did not use the one version he himself had promoted in earlier comics. He does however give two different versions of the release date: the first is \"9/13\" in the first panel, which is at least (usually — see below) only readable one way; harder to misinterpret is the more expansive \"Sep 13, 2022\" in the final panel. A format that he could have used to avoid any confusion is: \"the book is released on 2022-09-13,\" using the international standard as defined in the {{W|ISO 8601}} standard and shown in [[1179: ISO 8601]].\n\nThe clarification reads: By 9/13, I mean September 13th, not the 9th day of Jancember, the cursed 13th month that exists between December and January in the transdimensional temporal plane. \n\nSince there are only 12 months in the year, 9/13 actually cannot be mistaken, while 9/12 might be. So there was really no need for this clarification, especially with the last text in the last panel. So this is of course just a title text joke, where he can manage to make a [[:Category:Portmanteau|portmanteau]] of January and December (\"Jancember\") and then then call this a cursed month as it would be the 13th month if it came before New Year. This comic came out at the end of January, so it could have been at the end of Jancember instead. The number thirteen is seen by many as an unlucky number, so a thirteenth month would be considered cursed by some, or at least unlucky.  \nIn reality, a 13th month can exist in some alternate calendars and is then called \"{{W|Undecimber}}\".  \n\nAt the release of this comic, the header changed to promote the website, the [[Design_of_xkcd.com#xkcd_links|xkcd links]] in the top left section of xkcd was changed to promote the book and he made his first [[Blag]] post in more than two years with the [https://blog.xkcd.com/2022/01/31/what-if-2/ What If 2] post. \n\nThe [https://what-if.xkcd.com/ what if?] header was also changed to accommodate promotion of the new book; not so strange, seeming as it was based on that blog. A picture is displayed at the top with the book at both ends and this text in between, with the first line taking up the top and the two other lines below, the first in a frame:\n:What If? 2\n:Preorder now\n:On sale 9/13\nThe entire picture links to the what if? 2 page.\n\nExactly two months after the release of this promotion comic Randall made another comic about his new what if? 2 book: [[2600: Rejected Question Categories]]. In this he also gives the release day as 9/13, in the title text, although without any mention of the ambiguity of this date format.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Randall, drawn as Cueball, is throwing his arms out as he stands next to a big red book with white drawings on the cover. The cover shows a large passenger plane that has just taken off, as can be seen since the landing gear still has the wheels extended (only one wheel is visible at the middle part and then the one in the front). A Tyrannosaurus Rex has jumped on to the plane and it is biting down on the ceiling of the plane a bit in front of the wings, as if on the back of a prey. The dinosaur has already broken through the ceiling. Below is a jagged landscape with small mountain like peaks in the background. Megan and Cueball are standing on the top of the second of two raised plateaus, looking up at the plane and dinosaur. There is unreadable white text above the plane, then a title beneath the plane, and the authors name below the landscape, and more unreadable text beneath that, all in white. Below the book, there is a small arrow pointing to the right bottom of the book, with a label beneath.]\n:Randall: '''Announcement:'''  I’m publishing a ''what if?'' sequel!\n:Book cover: what if? 2 \n:Book cover: Randall Munroe\n:In stores 9/13, available for preorder now: <small>xkcd.com/whatif2</small>\n\n:[Randall is shown holding up his smart phone in one hand. The screen lights up as indicated with small lines at the top. These point up to at least six SMS texts, each with two lines of text. They are shown in speech bobbles with a small arrow in the bobbles lower left corner. All six are covered partly by either the other five, or by Randall’s head, and none of them can be read in any meaningful way; only parts of sentences or words are clearly visible. The bobbles and the text in them are all drawn in gray. Randall is narrating (not speaking) in this panel, both above the SMS texts, and below.]\n:Randall narrating: Ever since I wrote '''''what if?''''', I’ve been flooded with questions. \n:Randall narrating: And not just from readers- My friends and family stated texting them to me, too.\n:Text 1: <font color=\"gray\">Hey, could s.. ele</font>\n:Text 2: <font color=\"gray\">Hypothe…</font>\n:Text 3: <font color=\"gray\">If you s… Jupiter…</font>\n:Text 4: <font color=\"gray\">Could my ca… or…</font>\n:Text 5: <font color=\"gray\">Do you… my car…</font>\n:Text 6: <font color=\"gray\">If I trie… the sun, would I…</font>\n:Randall narrating: Honestly, I love it.\n\n:[Randall is again standing next to his red book talking. There is also a second version of the book lying to the right of the closed book, and this has been opened up to reveal two pages. The text is unreadable and the images are very hard to see, but it seems that two people are standing next to each other on the right page. The image at the top of the left page has been enlarged and shown to the right of the open book. It is an image of the Earth that is being peeled by a potato peeler, which takes off a large peel from the north part of Scandinavia and then goes via Russia into Asia. The title and author name can still just be read on the book,but maybe only because they are already known...]\n:Randall: The questions are so good. People have asked about touching exotic  materials, traveling across space and time, eating things they shouldn’t, and smashing large objects into the Earth. There are questions about lasers, explosions, swingsets, candy, and soup. Several planets are destroyed-one of them by the soup.\n:Book cover: what if? 2 \n:Book cover: Randall Munroe\n\n:[Zoom in on the top part of Randall speaking on.]\n:Randall: Like the first book, '''''what if? 2''''' also features collections of short answers, new lists of weird and worrying questions, and some of my favorite answers from the What if site.\n\n:[Only the closed red book are shown in this panel, in an even larger version than in any of the previous panels. But it is still only the title and the author name that can be read, but in this version these can also be read on the spine of the book. Randall is narrating again, and there are text both above and below the book.]\n:Randall narrating: If you want to get it when it’s released, you can preorder a copy at xkcd.com/whatif2\n:Book spine: what if? 2 Randall Munroe\n:Book cover: what if? 2 \n:Book cover: Randall Munroe\n:Randall narrating: Available Sep 13, 2022\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic came out just a few minutes after the [[Countdown in header text]] ended.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Randall Munroe]]\n[[Category:What If?]]\n[[Category:Book promotion]]\n[[Category:Portmanteau]] <!-- Title text -->\n[[Category:Calendar]]  <!-- Title text -->\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Comics with cursed items]] <!-- The month 'Jancember' -->\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]] <!-- The URI announced -->"
