Wow, just got the subtext there. Also, the apparently eager Beyoncé would've made one badass Nazgûl.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe character in armor is {{w|Sauron}}, the main villain in ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings}}'' trilogy. In the backstory of the ''{{w|The Silmarillion}}'', he takes control of Middle-earth by giving several {{w|Rings of Power}} as \"gifts\" to the great kings of  men, dwarves and elves after teaching the craft to the elves. However, he also forged a master ring, the {{w|One Ring}}, to control the {{w|Rings of Power}} and ultimately rule over the kings. However, the elves were not deceived by his plan and took off their rings. Enraged, Sauron started War of the Elves and Sauron. After losing that war Sauron started a religion in {{w|Númenor}}. After using his influence to convince Númenóreans to attack Aman, the island is destroyed by Eru. Then Sauron started {{w|Last Alliance of Elves and Men|War against the Last Alliance}}. Sauron is eventually defeated in said war by {{w|Isildur}} who cuts off his ring finger. The books tell the story of a small group of adventurers who rediscover the lost Ring and attempt to destroy it, as Sauron's army gathers its forces to attempt to reclaim the Ring for their master.\n\n{{w|Gil-galad}} is a high Elven-king, and {{w|Galadriel}} is an Elf of royal blood who serves as a matriarch of sorts to the remnants of the Elven race. {{w|Geography_of_Middle-earth#Lindon|Lindon}} is a location on the westernmost side of the continent, serving as the final transition point for Elves passing on to the Undying lands. Sauron refers to an actual event in the first panel, when he tried to gain control of Lindon through deceit; Galadriel and Gil-galad saw through his disguise and cast him out. \n\nIn the second panel Sauron is talking about {{w|Eru Ilúvatar}}, the creator in Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. While Eru created elves and men it was {{w|Aulë}} who created Dwarves, Eru gave them life. Orcs were Elves twisted by {{w|Morgoth}} so Sauron, being his principal lieutenant, would be a natural leader to orcs by the time he created the One Ring.\n\nThe song playing in the background is \"All the Single Ladies\" by Beyoncé, which includes the line \"If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it,\" referring to ''{{w|wedding rings}}''. This is shown as being what inspired Sauron to devise his plan to control others through the gift of rings.\n\nThe title text refers to an often-suggested fan theory that the One Ring ''is'' actually meant to be symbolic of marriage. This theory is incorrect. The {{w|Nazgûl}}, also known as ringwraiths, are the former nine human kings who were bound by the rings, now a band of nine servants to Sauron who constantly seek out the Ring for him.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Sauron from the Lord of the Rings is sitting at a bar, where Beret Guy is bartending; Sauron is wearing his trademark helmet, but he's hanging his head in apparent sadness or resignation. Music plays in the background.]\n:''Music: All the single ladies, All the single ladies''\n:Beret Guy: Hey Sauron, why so glum?\n:Sauron: Gil-galad saw through me and threw me out of Lindon. Galadriel as well. I'll never rule ''anyone'' at this rate.\n\n:''Music: All the single ladies, All the single ladies''\n:Sauron: Eru created such beautiful creatures - Elves and men and dwarves - and all I've got are these stupid orcs.\n\n:''Music: 'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it''\n:Sauron: I mean, I-\n\n:[Sauron is suddenly quiet.]\n:''Music: If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it''\n\n==Trivia==\n* Randall used the wrong \"û\" character when editing the title text; the character he used was U+0217 LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH INVERTED BREVE, but the correct character is U+00FB LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH CIRCUMFLEX. They look very similar at standard font sizes, but the inverted breve is curved, while the circumflex is pointed.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:LOTR]]\n[[Category:Songs]]"
