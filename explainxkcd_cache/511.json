The dialog is likely her thoughts, rather than speech. She is fed up with the second person's endless discussion of {{w|digital rights management}} (DRM). She probably agrees with his position, but would rather face the weather than his endless rehashing of the issue.\n\nThe words in the first panel are the opening lyrics of the Christmas standard, {{w|Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!}}.\n\nIn the last panel, ''{{w|Free Culture (book)|Free Culture}}'' refers to a book by {{w|Lawrence Lessig}}, who advocates for fewer restrictions in many areas. Randall had previously advocated this title himself in [[86: Digital Rights Management]] and [[129: Content Protection]], and mentioned Lessig in [[343: 1337: Part 3]].\n\nIn the title text, it is revealed that Megan herself is also guilty of droning on about 'boring' subjects, likely to the annoyance of those around her. In this case, complaining about science-fiction TV series ''{{w|Battlestar Galactica}}'', which tends to produce strong reactions among {{w|Geek|geeks}}. She has gone outside to avoid the boring rant. However, given the opportunity, it is she who would be doing the ranting.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The comic is set on a rainy, cold, windy street; Megan is walking along said street with a scarf; narration is from Megan's point-of-view.]\n:The weather outside is frightful.\n:I hate trudging through the icy slush and biting sleet.\n:But it beats lying in our warm, cozy bed\n:Listening to you talk about DRM for hours on end.\n:Offscreen: Come back! Just listen to this one quote from ''Free Culture!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Weather]]\n[[Category:DRM]]"
