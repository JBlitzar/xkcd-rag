A common colloquial term for people in this position is to refer to the two participants as \"big spoon\" (the one behind) and \"little spoon\" (the one in front). Cueball points out that the colloquialism does not have any basis in reality due to how spoons nest; commonly, spoons of the the same size will form a relatively uniform stack (which may be handy with a full complement of {{w|cutlery}} that is stored together in functional groups), while the spoons of differing sizes would rest awkwardly due to the different curvature in their handles and bowls, and the neck between.\n\nThere are some exceptions, such as a {{w|File:Swedish Measuring Spoon Set.jpeg|measuring spoon ''set''}}, or one-person camping set (perhaps small spoon, large spoon, plus knife and fork; or involving [[419: Forks and Spoons|hybrid]] {{w|Combination eating utensils|flatware}}), where one of each type is deliberately designed to be nested/packed against the others in a particular order. Occasionally, same sized spoons of a given design do not nest neatly, due to the design resulting in differing front and back profiles.\n\nThe last panel reveals that he is {{tvtropes|ExiledToTheCouch|sleeping on the couch}}, presumably because of his nitpickery regarding the colloquialism. From another room, someone else — presumably Megan — realizes that he is addressing anyone who is listening about this, and expresses annoyance that he hasn't let the matter go. Cueball merely insists that he's ''right'', indicating [[386: Duty Calls|his refusal]] to let the matter slide. His insistence on being right in this case is apparently more important to him than spooning; instead he's alone on the couch and forked.\n\nThe title text asks whether you are the annoying spoon or the sleepy spoon, which, in this context, most likely means to ask whether you are like Cueball (who is being considered annoying) or like his sleepy partner.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript}}\n:[Close up shot of Cueball's head and neck.

You nest ''same''-sized spoons.\n\n:[Cueball is lying alone on a couch.]\n:Cueball: ...and apparently ''we'' sleep on the couch.\n:[Voice from outside the panel:]\n:Voice: Why are you ''still'' going on about the spoon thing?\n:Cueball: Because I'm ''right!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
