Wait, damn, original research.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe \"Choices\" series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday). It explores and marvels at human freedom. This is, however, a little sidetrack from the \"Choices\" narrative. [[Cueball]] is studying {{w|special relativity}}. The {{w|speed of light}} in a vacuum (299,792,458&nbsp;m/s) is denoted as ''c''. [[Megan]] and the spaceship are shown traveling at 0.2''c'' in opposite directions. This would mean (in Newtonian mechanics) 0.4''c'' relative to each other. But due to relativistic effects, their velocities do not simply add when the spaceship observes Megan; in reality, both would measure only 0.385''c'' ( = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c<sup>2</sup>) ) from the other's point of view. Also, {{w|time dilation}} influences the way time is observed with reference to the two frames of reference. Megan, however, has other concerns. (This text and part of the image were completely reused in the [[1350#Space|space part]] of the interactive [[1350: Lorenz]] (see image [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/File:lorenz_-_rocket_16.png here]).\n\nIn the title text, Megan thinks about writing about this after-worldly place in Wikipedia, but then realizes that the content would be removed, due to the {{w|Wikipedia:No original research|Wikipedia policy on original research}}, meaning that you are discouraged from writing your own thoughts, the preference being that you have a source you're paraphrasing. Even though her claims would be true, she would need reliable written sources to support them.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week.
