Randall is parodying the website by having them \"review\" the 70 most popular [[:Category:Religion|religion]]s. Product review websites typically make posts with the \"best\" X, e.g. \"Best smartphones,\" or \"Best laptops.\" These reviews are useful for consumers trying to choose among the wide variety of products available. \n\nThere are {{w|List of religions and spiritual traditions|a wide variety of religions}}. However, unlike electronic devices, a person does not usually choose their religion; they are typically taught one during childhood and most remain in that religion their entire life. Changing religions is ([[1102: Fastest-Growing|usually]]) a significant life event. Many religions, including many variants of the three major {{w|Abrahamic religions}} promote {{w|Religious exclusivism|exclusivity}}, and do not recognize other religions as valid. They emphasize the importance of specific practices or belief in specific creeds. Members of those religions might not recognize a reviewer as having truly \"tried\" their religion if their intent was always to move on to another.\n\nA post \"reviewing\" religions is sure to stir up controversy, as many religious followers are passionate about their religious beliefs and believe their religion is best. {{w|Religious_war|Literal wars}} have been fought over the idea one religion could be superior to another, and it is not a wound most practitioners are willing to reopen any time soon. Moreover, religions are typically chosen for more fundamental reasons -- such as by comparing the likelihood that each religion makes accurate claims, or the efficacy of each religion in promoting an ethical life, or the connection a practitioner feels to the religion's rituals, metaphors, and images, or by privileging a preexisting cultural or family connection to a particular tradition -- not by comparing gimmicky features or price. \n\nThe title text mentions \"budget\" and \"upgrade\" picks, which are subcategories for reviewers - cheaper options and options that are good for upgrading your current product. Neither of these categories are typical categories for religions{{Citation needed}} and could further anger their adherents. The association of religion and money could allude to various controversial topics such as {{w|tithe|tithing}}, {{w|indulgences}}, {{w|televangelism}}, or {{w|Prosperity theology}} (yuck).  Budget need not be just about money, it could also refer to the amount of time or effort involved.  (e.g., how much time is spent in religious activities, needing to learn a new language, etc.)  Some religious followers might be offended{{Citation needed}} if their religion was picked (or ''not'' picked) in a \"budget\" category. The idea of a religion \"upgrade\" evokes the highly divisive concept of {{w|supersessionism}} among the major Abrahamic religions, which would be guaranteed to cause further outcry no matter which one of those the article would pick for the category. (Various forms of {{w|syncretism}} could qualify as an \"upgrade,\" but whatever Wirecutter's intent, that is unlikely to be the first thing anyone reading such an article thinks of.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A New York Times Wirecutter article.
