The list includes 13 movies, 2 video games, and one television episode. The works referenced are:\n{{spoiler|The following descriptions contain spoilers about each work's titular conflict.}}\n\n* ''{{w|Kramer vs. Kramer}}'', a 1979 legal drama about a couple (the Kramers) divorcing.

This is often considered one of the best ''Simpsons'' episodes of all time. '''Winner: Marge'''\n\n* ''{{w|Justice League vs. Teen Titans}}'', a 2016 direct-to-video animated superhero film.  The Justice League and Teen Titans are both superhero teams and usually are on the same side, but in this film, the Justice League are possessed by demons and forced to fight the Titans.  The Teen Titans defeat Superman to free him from possession and turn the tide against the rest of the League and defeat the demons.  '''Winner: Teen Titans'''\n\n* ''{{w|Asterix Versus Caesar}}'', a 1985 animated film and a film adaptation of the {{w|Asterix}} comic book series.

Batman is on the verge of killing Superman when he realizes Lex Luthor's manipulation. They decide to end their hostilities toward each other. Lex Luthor releases {{w|Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday}}, and Superman sacrifices himself to defeat him.  '''Winner: Batman'''. \n\n* ''{{w|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World}}'', a 2010 film based on the ''Scott Pilgrim'' graphic novel.

'''Winner: none''' (both monsters kill each other)\n\n* ''{{w|Plants vs. Zombies}}'', a 2009 tower defense and strategy video game. The player commands an army of plants who defend their home against the zombie apocalypse.  '''Winner: Plants''', assuming the player wins.\n\nAssuming the tournament bracket reflects the results of each original work, the second round would result as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| • '''Kramer''' vs. '''Ford''' - a newly-single mother against an automotive company.\n| • '''Marge''' vs. '''___''' - an American housewife against any possible representative from a superhero comics continuity or a company known for its action games.\n|-\n| • '''Larry Flynt''' vs. '''Volcano''' - the creator of a magazine against a natural rock formation spewing lava.\n| • '''Teen Titans''' vs. '''Asterix''' - a young superhero team against a Gaul warrior with a magic potion of super strength.\n|-\n| • '''King Kong ''' vs. '''Jason''' - a giant gorilla against an ambiguously-human serial killer.\n| • '''Batman''' vs. '''Scott Pilgrim''' - a billionaire-turned-vigilante against an ambiguously superpowered Canadian.\n|-\n| • '''Predator''' vs. '''(bye)''' - the Predator has no opponent, advances to the next round unopposed.\n| • '''Plants''' vs. '''(bye)''' - the plants have no opponent, advance to the next round unopposed.\n|}\n\nThe title text refers to the 2002 action film ''{{w|Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever}}'', which is qualified to be in this tournament by virtue of having the word \"vs.\" in its title, but as the film is regarded as one of the {{w|List of films considered the worst|worst movies ever made}}, it has been defeated in a pre-entry match vs. \"the passage of time\" - it is thus not considered worthy of entry in the tournament.\n\nTournament brackets is a [[:Category:Tournament bracket|recurring subject]] on xkcd, most recently used in [[2131: Emojidome]] and [[2037: Supreme Court Bracket]]. The latter is especially similar to this comic, considering that it also extends normal \"versus\" situations to a second round. The first bracket comic, [[1529: Bracket]], prompted people to create a series of polls to determine the end results, much like [[Randall]] later did himself with Emojidome. Randall even made [[Header text#2015-06-06_-_Other_news|a reference]] to one of those polls in the [[Header text|header text]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A tournament bracket tree is shown with 16 participants each on the left and right side. From both sides toward the middle the brackets reduce to eight, then four, two, and one line where the latter join to a rectangle in the middle.]\n\n:[Left side:]\n:Kramer - Kramer\n:Ford - Ferrari\n:The People - Larry Flint\n:Joe - The Volcano\n:King Kong - Godzilla\n:Freddy - Jason\n:Dracula - Frankenstein\n:Alien - Predator\n\n:[Right side:]\n:Marvel - Capcom\n:Marge - The Monorail\n:Justice League - Teen Titans\n:Asterix - Caesar\n:Batman - Superman\n:Scott Pilgrim - The World\n:Mega Shark - Giant Octopus\n:Plants - Zombies\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The same Twitter account that covered a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1529:_Bracket previous XKCD bracket] over three years ago, [https://twitter.com/xkcdbracket @xkcdbracket], was back to determine the winner of this one by public vote. The Volcano defeated Asterix in the final.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n\n[[Category:Tournament bracket]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes]]"
