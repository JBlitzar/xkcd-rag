The title text implies that things won't end well, and possibly that the counter-offensive from [[47: Counter-Red Spiders|the previous comic in the series]] had failed.\n\nThe full series of [[:Category:Red Spiders|Red Spiders]] comics:\n*[[8: Red Spiders]], the first one.\n*[[43: Red Spiders 2]], in which the spiders begin building.\n*[[47: Counter-Red Spiders]], in which the humans begin a counter-offensive.\n*[[126: Red Spiders Cometh]], this one.\n*[[427: Bad Timing]], in which, in a style more typical to xkcd, the spiders attack a couple in the middle of a serious relationship discussion in a hot-air balloon.\n*[[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel]], in which it appears briefly in the 14th panel crawling over a cube.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Many red spiders, standing on and hanging from blocks, hover ominously over a small city, ready to attack.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis sort of drawing, with blocks converging on a horizon, is a common type of drawing practice to practice three-dimensional views.\n\n{{Comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Red Spiders]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
