This system drops vast amounts of water into the exhaust of the rocket engines and the water vaporizes immediately. This vapor mainly interrupts the sound reflections from the ground. This reduces the sound to a level the rocket can withstand but also produces a big cloud of water mist. The cloud at the ground consists mostly of water and not the exhaust of the rocket engines. This article shows how the system works: [https://interestingengineering.com/nasa-sound-suppression-system-prevents-rocket-from-exploding NASA's Incredible Sound Suppression System Prevents Rockets from Exploding (interestingengineering.com)].\n\nSome rockets use liquid hydrogen as a fuel, especially for upper stages, so steam is the combustion product.\n\nThe title text references the failed o-ring that led to the {{Wikipedia|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|disintegration of the ''Challenger'' Space Shuttle}}. The o-ring in question failed to expand at freezing temperatures, resulting in a leak of gas around the edges that was visible as a small vapor plume on the recording.  The launch was pushed to a day with lower temperatures than the engineers had planned for.  For the humidifier to vent the water mist from this opening is indeed in poor taste, even though the model does not resemble a shuttle.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A rocket sits on a launch pad and the tower to the left has retracted its access arms. The engines seem to have just started firing and a small cloud at the bottom is visible.]\n\n:[The rocket still sits on the pad but the cloud is growing and extending to both sides on the ground.]\n\n:[Ponytail's head, much larger than the rocket, appears above the rocket on the right. The cloud covers the full ground and hides a bigger part of the rocket.]\n\n:[Zoom out. Ponytail stands behind a pedestal with a rocket model on top and the cloud is all around the bottom of the rocket and below.]\n:Off screen: It's still pretty dry in here.\n:Ponytail: I love the new humidifier, though.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was posted the day after the death of [https://www.nasa.gov/people/peter-cosgrove/ Peter Cosgrove] was reported. He was known for photographing many Space Shuttle launches.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]"
