The ''Mona Lisa'' is one of the most famous paintings in human history. At the time of this comic, the ''Mona Lisa'' has not been attacked and is unlikely to be shredded in this circumstance at least by dogs as it is painted on wood, rather than canvas.<ref>\"Mona Lisa | Painting, Subject, Meaning, & Facts.\" ''Britannica'', December 4, 2020. Accessed August 20, 2021. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mona-Lisa-painting</ref> In addition, the Mona Lisa is protected by bulletproof glass, so it is highly unlikely that a pack of wild dogs could shred the Mona Lisa alone without human assistance, even if you disregard the fact that it is painted on wood.\n\nAt the beginning of his comment, Cueball describes his reaction and disappointment about the event, describing the event as \"a loss for humanity.\" Cueball is then reminded of his first kiss, which occurred inside of a {{w|JCPenney}}, where a picture of the ''Mona Lisa'' hung on one of its walls. He adds this to his comment, explaining that this is why the news hits him hard. However, his story has almost no relation to the ''Mona Lisa'', other than that the picture was at the scene as well as being unnecessary.\n\nAfter posting the comment, Cueball reflects on this and mentions that not every news story is, or needs to be, about himself.\n\nThe title text describes an exception to this, where his experience IS directly related to the affected painting, as his ex seemingly planned to get revenge on the painting itself. The title text suggests that the dogs destroyed the painting before Cueball's ex could do so. (But perhaps it could be that she let the dogs in, and so this extra information could lead to the police finding the person who was responsible.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a desk, typing on his laptop. What he types is shown above Cueball, as indicated by the line going from his hands to the text.]\n:Cueball: Devastated to hear that a pack of wild dogs got into the Louvre and shredded the Mona Lisa.\n:Cueball: What a loss for humanity.\n:Cueball: My first kiss was in the aisle of a J.C. Penny{{asic}} that had a poster of the Mona Lisa on the wall, so this is hitting me especially hard.\n\n:[Caption below the panel]\n:Sometimes I have to remind myself not to make every news story about me.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
