This comic illustrates a vertical, rather than horizontal, ocean loop.\n\nThe comic shows a large construction, rising out of the sea to dwarf a nearby cruise ship. It involves a submerged water-jet sending water up out of the surface and round a rollercoaster-loop-like water-flume trough. The scale is such that it seems that the ship, once caught in the necessarily powerful stream of water, is also intended to be propelled around the inverting loop before \"safely\" exiting at the other side.\n\nThe design is reminiscent of the infamous 'Cannonball Loop' water slide - a [https://www.latimes.com/travel/themeparks/la-trb-action-park-looping-water-slide-20150305-story.html fully-functional] water slide complete with a loop-de-loop - which was one of many famously dangerous rides and attractions at Action Park; a theme park in New Jersey that became iconic for its blithe disregard for human safety, and the numerous accidents and deaths at the park as a result. This [https://youtu.be/P14W1pRRK9Y video], among other potentially dangerous water slides, shows 2 such loop-de-loop water slides ([https://youtu.be/P14W1pRRK9Y?t=487 1] and [https://youtu.be/P14W1pRRK9Y?t=522 2]).  Apart from various other issues regarding {{what if|43|large \"loop-de-loops\"}}, the stream of water required to maintain this setup would be {{w|Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|acting upon the nearby water}} and so the nearby ship is probably already close enough to be drawn into the loop (with the best option left being to deliberately steer into it, rather than risk being swept uncontrollably into the structure), assuming that it isn't already caught in the tug of the water-jet's inward flow.\n\nEven assuming a \"successful\" loop (the stresses and rotation inflicted by the loop are likely beyond the design limits of such a vessel), the emergence back into the ''relatively'' calm and stationary waters beyond the exiting outflow would be a severe challenge to navigation. On the positive side, due to the nature of buoyancy, if the loop structure itself is capable of withstanding the force of the water being forced round it then it ''should'' be equally capable of withstanding the passage of the ship, unlike an impromptu rail-based loop which might stand up on its own but then shake itself apart when the first carriage is sent around it.\n \nNot only would there be problems for the engineers, ship and navigators, the \"ride\" wouldn't be pleasant for the ship's passengers in any way. Many of the passengers would suffer extreme injuries from the changes of velocity (up to 370km/h or 230mph based on a loop radius of 3 x ship length) and rotation (unlike {{w|rollercoasters}}, or even airplanes during simple take-off and landing, passengers aren't normally strapped down). It is possible that the initial extreme undercurrent would capsize the ship. Depending upon where in the ship you were, the centripetal forces and the ship's rotation may not match for all passengers, forcing anyone not properly secured out towards the bow or stern. As well as the passengers, this also is relevant to all unsecured items (e.g. knives and forks would go flying off tables), as well as the dangers of breakable glass, liquids and many other dangerous objects which could create hazards even (or particularly) against those who have strapped themselves down to prevent their own movement through the ship.\n\nBecause of all these safety concerns, the caption, \"[[:Category: Banned from conferences|I don't know why the cruise line fired me]]\", suggests that someone in the company realized this would not be a good idea, and shut down the concept. However, the title text, \"I can't believe they wouldn't even let me hold a vote among the passengers about whether to try the loop\", implies that the narrator (whether because they simply hadn't thought it through properly, or they are [[Black Hat|someone with a sadistic nature]]) actually managed to get as far as building this loop and having a ship ready to try it. Considering the vast budget that would have been required to realise this concept, it appears that oversight at the cruise company is not what it could be, and perhaps others should be in line for firing as well (if it has not already bankrupted the company).\n\nWhen those in charge of the ship objected to sailing into this loop, the builder attempted to get around this by having the passengers vote on it. Presumably worried that opening the decision-making process to the passengers might favor the exciting risk over the well-founded reason of the staff, those in charge put a stop to that too. Cruise ships generally don't function as democracies, even outside of absurd situations such as the one depicted.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A cruise ship approaches an enormous loop-de-loop flume from the left.
