And according to Cueball this [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-super-bowl-50-862888 fraction is increasing], despite [http://moneyterms.co.uk/media-fragmentation/ media fragmentation]. Thus, even though there are today more and more different ways to watch news, sports and other entertainment, the Super Bowl continues to gain more viewers every year.\n\nIt turns out that Cueball has a problem. He cannot just reply to a simple question without trying to put the conversation into some kind of {{w|Context (language use)|context}} which does not necessarily have anything to do with the question asked, or at least not with the expected answer. From White Hat's reply it is obvious that he has had conversations like this with Cueball before, as he asks if they could ''just talk without your weird need to give context for everything?''\n\nCueball feels the need to disseminate any information he finds interesting, even in trivial conversation. Normally people like to have context-free conversations{{Citation needed}} and White Hat invites Cueball to try to fit in with normal people's conversational style.\n\nCueball apologizes and agrees to try, but even though he really tries hard, with his fists clenched and White Hat encouraging him to just reply normally to a question about the [http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/02/01/report-peyton-manning-has-told-close-friends-hell-retire/ rumored retirement] of {{w|Peyton Manning}}, he cannot stop himself from including context in his reply again. White Hat probably wanted Cueball to join in such minimal-context speculation. But, failing miserably again, White Hat finally gives up, and suggests they should try another conversation in a year, when Cueball might have learned to talk about the Super Bowl without context (hence the title).\n\nThis time he goes off on a tangent about Peyton as a {{w|mammal}}, and then adding the process of {{w|aging}} and mentioning two reasons for this (which are not well understood). The first he mentions is {{w|Ageing#Damage-related factors|accumulation of damage}}, which includes {{w|mutations}} that can lead to diseases such as {{w|cancer}}. The other process he mentions is {{w|Ageing#Programmed_factors|timed factors}} which includes {{w|telomeres}}. These have been linked to {{w|senescence|biological aging}} because of the shortening of telomeres at each {{w|Cell cycle|cell division}}; when telomeres become too short, the cells die (and so do mammals).\n\nTo cap it off, he mentions that {{w|retiring}} is a recent concept. But this only makes sense when compared to how long there have been mammals, not compared to how long there have been sports and games, where people could be too old, and thus need to retire long before they would die from old age. Before humans began to enjoy things for fun, the concept of retiring made no sense. You worked/fought for a living, until you got too old and died.\n\nCueball in this comic may represent [[Randall]], as much of [[xkcd]] is spawned from, or occasionally poking fun at, his own hyper-analytical tendencies. And it is also common knowledge that Randall is not very interested in sport, though there are several xkcd [[:Category:American football|comics about American football]]. The year before this one he made another comic in relation to the final, and in this comic, [[1480: Super Bowl]], he even mentions the fact that he does not know much about [[:Category:Sport|sports in general]]. So this is the second year in a row a comic has been released in conjunction with the Super Bowl final. But before 2015, there has only been one other comic like this, which was in 2006 with [[60: Super Bowl]].\n\nThe title text continues the joke with Cueball replying to the old {{w|anti-humor}} joke: \"{{w|Why did the chicken cross the road?}}\" Cueball replies with a preposterous amount of information instead of the cliched simplistic answer: \"To get to the other side.\"\n\nCueball begins with the origin of {{w|chickens}}. They are believed to be descendants from domestication of the {{w|Red junglefowl}}, which occurred at least five thousand years ago in Asia, as Cueball correctly explains. Before there were chickens, there could not be one crossing a road. It also couldn't be called \"crossing the road\" without a {{w|Road surface|pavement}}. The {{w|History_of_road_transport#Wheeled_transport|first development of paved roads}} was in the city of {{w|Ur}} in the ancient {{w|Sumer|Sumerian}} civilization about 4000 BC (6000 years ago) (also partly explained in Cueball's reply).\n\nAs a trivial note, this comic is a rare instance of White Hat not being the fall guy for the joke. But already in his next discussion with Cueball ([[1657: Insanity]]) he was again the butt of the joke.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat and Cueball are walking together.]\n:White Hat: Did you watch the Super Bowl?\n:Cueball: Yes, like a third of the country.\n:Cueball: A fraction that is steadily ''increasing'' despite media fragmentation.\n\n:[White Hat stops and Cueball turn towards him.]\n:White Hat: Can't we just talk without your weird need to give context for everything?\n:Cueball: Sorry. I'll try.\n\n:[As White Hat asks Cueball another question Cueball bunches his hands into fists. He is clearly struggling.]\n:White Hat: Sounds like Peyton Manning's probably going to retire.\n:Cueball: Yes, I... ...It...\n:White Hat: C'mon, you can do it...\n:Cueball: He...\n\n:[Cueball spreads out his arms a little as he replies with two long sentences, while White Hat walks away from him.]\n:Cueball: ''â€”Mammals like Peyton age via a process that involves both the accumulation of damage and poorly-understood timed factors.''\n:Cueball: ''Yet the concept of retirement itself is surprisingly recent...''\n:White Hat: Okay, good try. Maybe next year.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:American football]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl]]"
