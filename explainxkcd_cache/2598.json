For the second, you'll need some picture frames, a level, and a protractor that can do increments of less than a degree.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] is inviting [[Knit Cap]] into his newly repainted residence. Knit Cap is a {{w|graphic designer}} and he simply can't enter because of the [[#Colors|color scheme]] used. The caption explains that if you paint each wall a slightly different shade of off-white, a graphic designer will be so repulsed that they are physically unable to enter the room. This is analogous with a specific bit of vampire lore: {{w|Vampires}} cannot {{w|Vampire#Protection|enter a dwelling uninvited}}.\n\nBeing presented with visual information that is ''just not quite right'' is known to cause feelings of unease and revulsion, particularly when presented with CGI human faces, a concept known as the {{w|uncanny valley}}. This may not be strictly an [[:Category:How to annoy|attempt to annoy]], but it portrays a similar vibe to those which are.\n\nIn the title text, it mentions a contingency against the designer managing to actually overcome this disgust. In this case, Cueball sets up a second way to troll his graphic designer friend using some picture frames, a {{w|Level (instrument)|level}}, and a {{w|protractor}} that can measure increments of less than a degree. Cueball can then skew his picture frames by an extremely small amount, noticeable only to the designer friend, to disgust him even further â€” similar to the effect of [[1015: Kerning|bad kerning]]. This could thus be applied as with the use of {{w|Christian cross|crosses}} or {{w|Garlic|garlic}}, which vampires are famously repulsed by.\n\nAlthough the window ledges are slightly inclined, falling subtly from left to right, it is unlikely this is a deliberate aspect of the room so much as a side-effect of Randall's imprecise stick-figure drawing style.\n\n===Colors===\n[[File:2598 Graphic Designers oversaturated.png|thumb|Oversaturated version|300px]]\nTrue to the comic's joke, [[Randall]] has actually colored each segment of the comic differently to each other, even though normal persons would just perceive all walls as slightly gray (off-white). \nThe hexadecimal color codes are:\n* Floor: #FFFFFF [[https://www.colorhexa.com/ffffff White]]\n* Ceiling: #F3F7F8 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f3f7f8 Light Grayish Cyan]]\n* Walls (left-to-right)\n** #F2F0EE [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f2f0ee Light Grayish Orange]]\n** #F3F4F2 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f3f4f2 Light Grayish Green]]\n** #F2F3F4 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f2f3f4 Light Grayish Blue]]\n** #F3F2F4 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f3f2f4 Light Grayish Violet]]\n* Door: #F1F3F1 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f1f3f1 Light Grayish Lime Green]]\n* Left window frame/ledge: #F2EEF2 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f2eef2 Light Grayish Magenta]]\n* Right window frame/ledge: #F3F3F1 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f3f3f1 Light Grayish Yellow]]\n* Box seat top: #EEF1EC [[https://www.colorhexa.com/eef1ec Light Grayish Green]]\n* Box seat front: #F2EEF0 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f2eef0 Light Grayish Pink]]\n* Rug outer ring: #F0F2F1 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f0f2f1 Light Grayish Cyan - Lime Green]]\n* Rug inner panel: #F0EFF1 [[https://www.colorhexa.com/f0eff1 Light Grayish Violet]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands in a lightly adorned room of a house, facing an open doorway. Each surface is painted an almost imperceptibly different shade of off-white, except the floor which is white. There is a rug, a couch with a pillow (white) and a book. There are two windows, in the right there is a potted plant. Knit Cap stands in the open doorway, as if about to enter the house, one foot at the threshold, but not on the floor inside. Cueball is reaching towards the doorway, inviting Knit Cap to enter.]\n:Cueball: Come on in! We just repainted.\n:Knit Cap: I... can't.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:If you want to set up a vampire-style barrier to keep graphic designers from entering your house, just paint every surface a slightly different shade of off-white.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Knit Cap]]\n[[Category:Graphic designers]]"
