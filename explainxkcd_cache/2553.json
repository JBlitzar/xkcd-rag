This usually involves describing at what time related events happen. In this comic, a report at a {{w|nuclear power plant}} on the day of the comic's publishing starts with particularly vague timestamps (that a package of fireworks arrived \"roughly 18 hours prior\" to it), then uses approximate minute-level precision (\"14:00\" and \"14:20\", which could reasonably be five minutes off in either direction), then minute-level precision (\"14:28\"), then second-level precision (\"14:29:22\" and \"14:29:26\").\n\nThis suggests that the ''clock'' time is really a proxy for the ''amount'' of time before one specific moment where everything falls apart, and when seconds start appearing, it implies that the recollection is within a few minutes of the disaster. Normally the increased level of precision reflects close monitoring capabilities of the affected systems, reviewing monitoring equipment, such as surveillance camera and microphone recordings, and/or detailed analysis by incident investigators. It may have been sufficient for the resulting inquiry to merely note the prior arrival of the original package, and possibly then read off (whatever remains of) the signing-in logs for the approximate times each member of staff arrives on the scene. At some point, though, the investigation will refer to fully timestamped security recordings, perhaps even eventually frame-by-frame with particular interest in exactly which things touched exactly what other things, in sequence, in order to hopefully learn all the necessary lessons about the incident.\n\nSynchronization of events is important in [https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/process/Pages/default.aspx incident investigations], so often systems are required to take input from common, relatively precise time references, such as {{w|GPS_disciplined_oscillator|GPS}}, {{w|WWV_(radio_station)|WWV broadcast}}, or cellular telephone systems. For example, an aircraft crash needs {{w|Airport_surveillance_radar|radar}} positioning data synced with [https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/foa_html/chap3_section_4.html voice communications] and {{w|Flight_recorder|flight recorder data}}.  Lack of correlation between these is a potential source of conspiracy theories, for example one of the {{w|United Airlines Flight 93#Crash|hijacked planes on 9/11}} crashed into Pennsylvania either at 10:03 or 10:06 depending on two different information sources.\n\nIn many situations, incident reports are anonymized as shown to protect the identities of those people involved in the incidents. This is often done to prevent unnecessary blaming of certain individuals, particularly when it hasn't yet been determined whether the incident was negligence or just an accident. \n\nExamples of real-life incident reports with second-level precision timestamps showing the increasing precision around critical moments include:\n* [https://spaceflightnow.com/challenger/timeline/ Explosion] of the Space Shuttle Challenger \n* [https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/appendices/chernobyl-accident-appendix-1-sequence-of-events.aspx Chernobyl explosion]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident Three Mile Island Accident]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2021_United_States_Capitol_attack 2021 United States Capitol attack]\n\nThe report shown cuts off before reaching the actual incident, leaving it to the reader to imagine what happened next. If the birthday cake has lit candles, one possible sequence of events is that a dropped or badly thrown juggling pin could have hit one of them and then rolled over to the fireworks package, thus igniting the package. This would have caused the fireworks to go off underneath the reactor control's console.\n\nAlthough the comic refers to {{w|Juggling club|juggling \"pins\"}}, jugglers commonly call those props \"clubs.\" It is possible Randall is confusing the {{w|Bowling pin|similarly shaped objects}} in 10-pin bowling to juggling clubs. \"Pins\" are another name for a component of Uranium Carbide type {{w|Nuclear fuel#Uranium carbide|nuclear fuel rods}}, which are involved in the safe control of the nuclear reaction within a nuclear power plant. No sane reactor staff would juggle these complex, heavy and expensive pieces of equipment.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe title text refers to the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvCI-gNK_y4 theme music] from the 1975 film ''{{w|Jaws (film)|Jaws}}'', which has come to represent impending danger. Movies use music to create the correct emotional tone; suspenseful music indicates that something bad is about to happen. The ''Jaws'' theme is an iconic example, famously used to create a sense of foreboding, then uses increasingly rapid tempo to build a sense of imminent danger, culminating in a dramatic moment of disaster (a shark attack, in the film). As with the increasing tempo of this theme, the increasing precision with which events are recorded in an incident report build the increasing sense that something terrible is imminent. \n\n9603120071 is an actual accession number for an [https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=9603120071 incident] at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in 1996. Four slightly contaminated stray kittens were found, cleaned, and adopted. No clock times were mentioned in the report.\n\nReal-world nuclear power stations have strictly regulated control rooms which would prevent the simultaneous presence of fireworks, juggling and birthday celebrations.<ref>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Regulatory Guide 1.114, \"Guidance to Operators at the Controls and to Senior Operators in the Control Room of a nuclear Power Unit.\" (https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0823/ML082380236.pdf)</ref><ref>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Regulatory Guide 1.189, \"Fire Protection for Nuclear Power Plants.\" (https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1734/ML17340A875.pdf)</ref>  There is no East Valley nuclear power plant (just the [[2548: Awful People|East Valley Strangler]]), but there are two reactor units at the nuclear power plant in Beaver Valley, Pennsylvania.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Facility: East Valley Nuclear Plant\n:Date: 12/10/2021\n:Report ID: 9603120071\n:Event description: Roughly '''18 hours''' prior to the incident, an Amazon package containing fireworks was mistakenly delivered to the reactor control room and left under the console. \n:The next day, at approximately '''14:00''', Technician A arrived at the facility with a bag containing four juggling pins. At '''14:20''', Technician A entered the control room, and joined Technician B at the console. \n:At '''14:28''', Technician C exited the elevator and approached the control room holding a birthday cake intended for Technician B.\n:At '''14:29:22''', Technician A said \"Hey [Technician B], check out this cool trick I learned\" while taking out the juggling pins. Technician B turned to look just as, at '''14:29:26''', Technician C entered holding the cake.\n\n:[Caption below the panel]:\n:You know things are about to get bad when the incident report starts including seconds in the timestamps.\n\n{{comic discussion}}"
