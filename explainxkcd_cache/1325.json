Here's your first lesson: We're not actually walking somewhere together; I'm trying to leave this conversation and you're following me.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis strip portrays [[Cueball]]'s (and likely [[Randall]]'s) reaction to a very specific male complaint: that of self-proclaimed \"nice guy\" complaining about his lack of romantic success. \n\nThere's a stereotype, in popular culture, of women claiming they want to date nice guys, but actually dating men who are rude and/or treat them badly. This has given rise to a cliche about men who assume themselves to be nice guys, insisting that women reject them for being ''too nice''. In reality, there are many reasons why a person might experience a lack of romantic success, but the notion that it happens as a result of being too nice is ridiculously simplistic and self-serving. \n\nThe [[Cueball]]-like guy on the left in this picture is complaining (presumably because he has been romantically rejected) that women, as a group, are either lying or self-deluded about what they really want. Cueball's sarcastic interjection is that this very response to the situation shows a) an inability to accept rejection and b) a disrespect for both the judgment and self-awareness of any woman who isn't interested in him. This behavor is {{w|Passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive}} at minimum, and arguably both arrogant and misogynistic.\n\nThe thesis of the strip appears to be that the men who complain most loudly about being rejected for being 'too nice' are generally displaying that they're less nice than they imagine. While they may not be as overtly aggressive as other guys, responding to rejection by assuming there's something wrong with the person who rejected you (or with their entire gender, as in this case), is in fact both rude and condescending. The joke is that the guy is likely not nearly as nice as he imagines, and if being impolite were truly attractive to women, he'd be much more successful romantically. \n\nThe title text continues the \"conversation\", with Cueball implying that he believes that the first guy is bad at taking hints. He offers a \"crash course\" in hint taking by clarifying outright that he is trying to end the conversation while the first guy continues to follow him.\n\nThe concept of the self-identifying \"nice guy\" who actually may have less than admirable motives is also explored in [[513: Friends]]. See also the concept of \"negging\" as used in [[1027: Pickup Artist]]: ''you belittle chicks to undermine their self-confidence so they'll be more vulnerable and seek your approval''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is walking, and a Cueball-like guy follows him.]\n:Guy: Women ''say'' they want nice guys, but what they ''really'' want are—\n:Cueball: —Guys who respond to rejection by belittling their judgment and self-awareness?\n:Cueball: If so, don't worry — you'll be ''fine.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
