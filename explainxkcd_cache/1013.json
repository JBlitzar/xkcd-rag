''{{w|Sheeple}}'' is a {{w|portmanteau}} of ''sheep'' and ''people'' used as a derisive term to describe people who thoughtlessly wander through their daily lives going exactly where they are \"herded\" by the powers that be.\n\nHowever, in this comic, the Sheeple are humanoid sheep-men who have slumbered beneath the Earth for ten thousand years, and whom Cueball has inadvertently awoken with his repeated mantra, similar to saying \"bloody mary\" in a mirror three times (much as in [[555: Two Mirrors]]). The Sheeple appear to be some kind of {{w|Cthulhu_Mythos|eldritch}} {{tvtropes|EldritchAbomination|abomination}} who will destroy the human race, and judging from [[Megan|Megan's]] reaction and the off-panel voices, Cueball seems to be the only one previously unaware of their existence.\n\nThe title text says the humans will be led \"like lambs to the slaughter\" which is a phrase that appears many times in older texts, the Bible as an example. The phrase means that someone or something would be led to its destruction without it thinking to escape from the disaster. The Sheeple are likely to take it amiss, because it indicates the uncaring frequency with which humans kill juvenile sheep.\n\nSee more Sheeple-related comics at [[:Category:Sheeple]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball yells into a megaphone.]\n:Cueball: Your government has turned against you!
