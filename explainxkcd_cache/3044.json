On the face of it, someone buying a humidifier for the first time might not have an understanding of how much water the device needs, and could be taken by surprise (possibly when their water bill arrives, or by the number of times they are required to manually refill its reservoir). The review in the comic has taken it a step further, voicing their complaint as a flaw in this specific humidifier and wishing another model could somehow achieve the same results with less water.\n\nA humidifier works by evaporating water from a tank, causing the air around it to become more humid. The law of {{w|conservation of molecular quantity}} states that the amount of matter in any closed system must stay constant, with the corollary that the amount of any substance in a system can only increase by introducing more, or by generating the substance from existing matter in the system. The humidity level in a given space is a function of the amount of water vapor in the air (in comparison to the saturation levels of water vapor at the given temperature and pressure). Which means that water must be added in order to increase humidity levels under any given conditions. \n\nUnless the humidifier is leaking liquid water (which would likely be detected and mentioned), the amount of water the humidifier \"consumes\" is the same as the amount of water vapor added to the air (unless the [[2710: Hydropower Breakthrough|machinery is made by Beret Guy]]). The amount required depends on the relative humidity level (which is set by the user), air temperature and pressure, the rate of air movement out of the room, and any other sources of humidity present. The humidifier has no control over any of those variables, which means that any humidifier maintaining the same humidity levels under the same conditions must consume the same amount of water. This is not a comment on the quality or design of the specific humidifier, and blaming it on the device makes no sense.  The humor is thus at the expense of people who don't understand the requirements of their appliances (or other hypothetical services) and complain in ignorance about the impossible not being made possible for their convenience.\n\nThe joke in the title text is based on different senses of the word \"conservation\". To most people this refers to reducing wasted use of some material, e.g. \"water conservation\" means avoiding waste of water. But to physicists, it means that some quantity in a system stays the same; for instance, conservation of energy means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. For many years, most appliances have had {{w|Energy Star}} stickers that indicate their impact on the environment; by adopting the physicists' sense, they can trivially say they support water conservation. \n\nReviews have also been featured in [[937: TornadoGuard]], [[1036: Reviews]], and [[1869: Positive and Negative Reviews]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A product review is shown.

I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't use so much water.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:My favorite reviews are the ones that penalize products for not violating the laws of physics.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Online reviews]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]"
