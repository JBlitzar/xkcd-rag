Complete with the brief feeling of satisfaction, followed by ennui, followed by getting bored and trying to make it happen again.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic shows the popular video game ''{{w|Tetris}}'', in which you use different shaped pieces to fill in lines to score points. Filling multiple lines by adding a single piece results in bonus points. Normally all pieces — typically referred to as \"{{w|Tetromino|Tetrominos}}\" — are made up of four small squares. This has also been the case for all the pieces at the bottom of the game; however, some parts of some blocks have been erased, likely when a line had been deleted because it was full.\n\nHeaven, in ''Tetris'', is when you get the perfect piece that fills out all the other pieces on the board. The falling piece here is really odd, but it fits the 18 bare spaces exactly to make it possible to remove 6 lines in a row, compared to the four that is normally possible using the \"I\" tetromino (represented in ''Tetris'' as a straight line of four blocks, and in this comic as a straight brown bar). On top of the heavenly feeling of getting a piece that fits, the top score is also about to be smashed, as the player was at the moment only one point until reaching it!\n\nThe next piece, shown to the right, which shall come after the special one, is much taller than the normally possible \"I\" tetromino. A normal one can be seen at the bottom right of the game. This next piece seems to be ten tall, which when rotated fits the cleared bottom of the well perfectly. Also, the shown score is one less than the apparent high score, meaning that, by placing the new block, whoever is playing will beat their all-time record.\n\nThe title text compares this experience with sex, complete with an {{w|orgasm}} and the feelings you get right after sex. After \"the brief feeling of satisfaction\" from the orgasm you are bored, {{w|ennui}} means a feeling of utter weariness and discontent resulting from {{w|satiety}} or lack of interest, but at the end you want more.\n\nA fan has made a modified version of the classic ''Tetris'' game, where at a certain frequency, a heavenly perfectly-fitting block comes along. The game can be found at [https://www.kongregate.com/games/kaolin/heaven Kongregate].\n\nAlso see comic [[724: Hell]], which presents an opposing situation in which the game is designed to be impossible to play.\n\nChoosing to post a comic called Heaven as number {{w|888_(number)#Symbology_and_numerology|888}} is not a coincidence—as in Christian numerology, the number 888 represents Jesus and in Chinese numerology it represents triple fortune.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The panel shows the display of a Tetris game. A large oddly shaped piece is falling towards the board. The piece fits into the gaps exactly to complete six rows at once. The next piece is simply a very long brick. All the pieces at the bottom are made from possible Tetris pieces.]\n:Next\n:Top \n:0002187\n:Score \n:0002186\n:Level\n:5\n:[Below the panel:]\n:Heaven\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Video games]]"
