The other comics are [[1876: Eclipse Searches]], [[1877: Eclipse Science]], [[1878: Earth Orbital Diagram]], and [[1880: Eclipse Review]].\n\nDuring an eclipse, birds and other animals show atypical behavior like they do in the case of the darkness in the night and the following sunrise. Birds stop singing during totality, then greet the return of the sun with a \"dawn chorus\". Owls, however, become active as do mosquitoes. But it's not easy to find studies about this behavior because the main focus lies mostly on the eclipse itself. And total solar eclipses are rare -- roughly every 18 months and then mostly not in the same region of this world. A nice article can be found here: [https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article-pdf/42/4/4.4/436602/42-4-4.4.pdf Effects of the 2001 total solar eclipse on African wildlife]. Hippos were so confused that their daily routine even on the next day was not back to normal. Baboons stopped feeding and a sun squirrel that fed in the afternoons didn't do so, while other larger animals like crocodiles, zebras, or lions were not affected. Butterflies settled and did not restart flying, mosquitoes appeared and settled before reappearing in the evening. Also, bees moved into a hive and didn't come out until the next morning.\n\nAfter the 2017 eclipse, NASA published some [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/2017-solar-eclipse-highlights highlights].

However, instead of just cheeping and screeching in a different pattern than birds actually do during an eclipse, in the comic, the birds begin to prepare to make a sacrifice to appease their gods, similar to how ancient cultures like the {{w|Aztecs}} [//www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/18/16078886/total-solar-eclipse-folklore are said to have acted]. Megan remains strangely nonchalant, offering only a clich√©d admiration of nature as the birds around her use fluent English to set up a sacrificial ritual.\n\nIn the title text, it turns out that the birds are about to sacrifice Megan, and Cueball tells them to stop. But Megan tells him it is OK as she wants to try experiencing being carried to a blood cauldron as she won't get another chance until the next eclipse in the US on {{w|Solar eclipse of April 8, 2024|8th of April, 2024}}.
