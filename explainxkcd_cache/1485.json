It is a portmanteau of the words brother, meaning a close male friend (aka \"bro\"), and romance.\n\nAlthough current in popular media, some commentators have criticized the implicit homophobia in the term, suggesting that it [https://goodmenproject.com/gender-sexuality/hesaidfor-the-love-of-god-please-stop-saying-bromance/ denotes cultural discomfort at relationships of emotional closeness between men.]\n\nIn this comic, Randall is implying the Wikipedia page for the word \"bromance\" should more accurately represent what most bromances actually are: friendships. This could be a joke to reference the fact that some males prefer to not call friendships as such, for fear of looking unmasculine, or being confused as a gay couple. The comic makes light of the fact that the word bromance and friendship are interchangeable, and should be treated as such.\n\nThe comic later contains parts of the edited article, mocking the use of \"bromance\" in popular culture, implying that \"friendships\" can be used just as easily to describe platonic male relationships.\n\nDespite supposedly vandalizing the \"bromance\" article, the article is titled \"friendship\", giving a similar result to word-replacement browser extensions, as in [[1031: s/keyboard/leopard/]].\n\nThe title text implies Randall does not agree with Wikipedia vandalism, except in the case of bromance/friendship, and also militia/fanclub, possibly to make light of the harsh sounding word in a negative light. This is probably because many of his comics include fake wikipedia entries, and many people, inspired by the comic, actually make the edit happen.\n\nA later comic called [[1746: Making Friends]], was also not so much about friendship, but rather about vultures...\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Wikipedia style layout is shown for extracts from an article titled Friendship.]\n\n:<div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #bbbbbb\">'''Friendship'''</div>\n:<span style=\"color: #A0A0A0\"><sup>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</sup></span>\n:A Friendship is a close non-romantic relationship between two (or more) men, a form of <span style=\"color: #0645AD\">affectional</span> or <span style=\"color: #0645AD\">homosocial</span> intimacy.<sup><span style=\"color: #0645AD\">[1]</span></sup>\n: Contents [<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">hide</span>]\n:<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">1 Etymology</span>\n:<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">2 Characteristics</span>\n:<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">3 Portrayal of friendship</span>\n::<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">3.1 Celebrity and fictional friendships</span>\n::<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">3.2 Historical and political friendships</span>\n::<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">3.3 Gay-straight friendships</span>\n:<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">4 See also</span>\n:<span style=\"color: #0645AD\">5 References</span>\n:<div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #bbbbbb\">'''Etymology'''</div>\n:''Friendship'' is a <span style=\"color: #0645AD\">portmanteau</span> of the words ''friend'' and ''ship''.
