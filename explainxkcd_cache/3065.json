As it is relayed through a chain of conversations, this measurement gets misinterpreted up to 12 times until [[Hairbun]] tells other people that it devours an area of grass equal to two times the land area of Australia per day, which is clearly impossible by one insect.{{citation needed}} This is similar to the premise of [[2585: Rounding]].\n\nThis gross error is the result of repeatedly misinterpreting the number of square units as the side length of a square, thus increasing the described area by the power of two. The chain also involves converting between {{w|imperial units}} and {{w|International System of Units|SI}} units, thus introducing smaller rounding errors, and frequently switching which measurement is \"a single square with sides of a certain distance\" and which is \"the number of squares that are each of unit length\". The upshot is that, while each statement has two (or more) roughly similar measurements of area, the chain of misunderstanding ends up escalating to ever larger relative expanses. The later participants in this chain also clearly forget to sanity-check their figures, blithely informing others that an individual insect is effectively consuming impossibly huge quantities of food, and traveling enormous linear distances every day to do so. In fact, assuming the insect could continuously eat a 1cm strip of grass, it would need to travel at (2,500 miles)<sup>2</sup> / 1cm / 24 hours = 1.87×10<sup>7</sup> km/s, which is about 62 times the speed of light.\n\nIn the final frame, [[Blondie]] further misinterprets the comparative 'area of Australia' to mean the ''actual'' land mass of Australia, with the notional insect entirely defoliating the country twice a day, presumably of whatever had managed to grow within each 12 hour cycle. This would quickly kill off a large proportion of the vegetation, leading to a decreasing food supply for the insect.\n\nThe title text tells us that [[Randall]] once found an 80-fold error in a reported distance in a published source. However, it is left as an exercise for the reader to figure out which one. In imperial units, a mile is equal to 80 {{w|chain (unit)|chain}}s, but the 80-fold error was likely due to a different chain of at least three unit conversions and area/length misinterpretations.\n\n===Conversions===\nIn the table, dark green to light green shows an increase in size due to inaccurate conversion, while dark red to light red shows a decrease in size.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
