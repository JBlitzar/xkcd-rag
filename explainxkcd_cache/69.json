The \"Wexler\" in the title text refers to Wexler's algorithm, which is used to deal with the inverse problem of {{w|electrical impedance tomography}}, or simply stated: the electrical conductivity of an (inhomogenous) object.\n\nBoth of these would make terrible {{w|pillow talk}}. Pillow talk is the conversation made by lovers after they have had sex, and is usually relaxed and intimate instead of technical.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Staring at the ceiling, she asked me what I was thinking about.\n:Cueball: I should have made something up.\n:Cueball: The Bellman-Ford algorithm makes terrible pillow talk.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The number of this comic is 69. This number is a term for mutual simultaneous oral sex, sex being the subject of the comic.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
