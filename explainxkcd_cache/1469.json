    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1469\n| date      = January 5, 2015\n| title     = UV\n| image     = uv.png\n| titletext = Hey, why stop at our house? We could burn down ALL these houses for the insurance money.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Ultraviolet}} light (abbreviated UV light, as in the title of the comic) is a kind of light that is slightly more energetic than the light in the {{w|visible light|visible}} portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ultraviolet light is normally by itself invisible to human eye, but can induce {{w|fluorescence}} (glowing) of certain organic molecules. A UV flashlight can thus be a means to detect small amounts of blood, semen, and urine on surfaces.\n\nThe first part of this comic focuses on [[Megan]] showing off her new {{w|Black light|UV flashlight}} to [[Cueball]] by revealing how disgusting their bathroom appears in UV light despite how clean it appears normally. She manages this due to UV light's special property of causing chemicals in urine to glow. Both Cueball and Megan are horrified by their discovery. This is a common reaction in the face of more sensitive diagnostic tests. Cueball's comment is a reference to the 1979 sci-fi film {{w|Alien (film)|Alien}}.\n\nIn the second part of the comic they realize that their house will never be clean enough. So Megan resolves to burn down the house for the insurance money (i.e. {{w|insurance fraud}}). Cueball is in doubt, but Megan apparently has no morality left. She even proclaims this while pouring some dangerous liquid, probably gasoline, on to the floor of their apartment.\n\nThe last panel of the comic implies that the two hadn't purchased fire insurance beforehand, and plan on purchasing it now, only to make a claim immediately afterwards. At this point Cueball has been won over by Megan's plan and tries to help by searching for insurance companies using Google. They wish to find the company that pays out the most. This plan will almost certainly not work since insurance typically only covers events that begin ''after'' purchasing the insurance, and does not cover anything that happens before purchasing the insurance, or that is intentionally caused.\n\nThe title text shows just how distorted Megan's and Cueball's thinking has become, as one of them suggests burning down '''all''' the houses in order to claim the insurance money for them. This plan will also not work. Even if insurance has been purchased for these other homes, the insurance companies will pay the owners of those homes, not Cueball and Megan. Instead, Cueball and Megan would likely be arrested for multiple charges of arson and end up in prison for a very long time.\n\nThe take home message of this comic must be: '''Never''' use a UV light in your bathroom. Maybe Randall did this by mistake causing the creation of this comic.  (Randall has previously warned people about similar diagnostics in [[860|860: Never Do This]].)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan holding a flashlight and standing behind Cueball, who is sitting at a computer.]\n:Megan: Our bathroom looks pretty clean, right?\n:Cueball: I think so.

Clean and clean and never stop.\n:Megan: It won't be enough. We should just burn the place down for the insurance money.\n\n:[Cueball standing behind Megan. Megan is pouring a liquid onto the floor out of a red-colored canister labled \"Danger\".]\n:Cueball: Isn't that wrong?\n:Megan: My morality has evaporated under the harsh UV light.\n\n:[Megan and Cueball standing outside the burning building.]\n\n:[Megan and Cueball standing, Cueball looking at his phone.]\n:Cueball: OK, I'm Googling insurance companies. Which one do you think pays the most? \n:Megan: Let's just try calling around.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color‏‎]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Google]]"
