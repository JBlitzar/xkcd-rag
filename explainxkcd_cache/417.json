Soon to be a major motion picture.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:A Matter of Some Gravity.png|right]]\n\nThis comic is humorously built-up like a short drama story, about a man (Cueball) with an unusual physics condition.\n\nIt might have been inspired by the {{w|Uncle Scrooge}} adventure comic \"{{w|A Matter of Some Gravity}}\" ([http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+96001 Inducks]) by {{w|Don Rosa}}, in which {{w|Magica de Spell}} makes gravity pull sideways at {{w|Scrooge McDuck}} and {{w|Donald Duck}}.\nThe same topic is covered by 1996 graphic novel ''{{w|L'enfant penchée}}'' (''The Leaning Child''), but, as it was only published in English in 2014, it’s very unlikely to be a source of inspiration for this comic.\n\n\"Soon to be a major motion picture\" in the title text might refer to ''{{w|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button}}'', a film released later in 2008 (and based on a short story), in which the protagonist Benjamin suffers of the impossible condition of aging backwards.\n\n\"Over land... and sea\" might be from the song \"Nature Boy\" by {{w|eden ahbez}}. Nat King Cole sung (the most famous version) about \"A very strange, enchanted boy. They say he wandered very far, very far over land and sea.\"\n\nThe title text mentions {{w|Jeph Jacques}}, who runs the webcomic ''{{w|Questionable Content}}''. Jeph has also described the creation of this comic in his [https://jephjacques.tumblr.com/post/11265563239/qa-dump-09 blog] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20240511203429/https://jephjacques.tumblr.com/post/11265563239/qa-dump-09 archived]) while working at [https://ezplaytoys.com ezplay company].\n\nWhen Cueball hits Megan, he knocks her down and \"knocks her up\", in what is probably intended to be a visual form of {{w|antanaclasis}}. Megan tells [[Hairy]] about a person knocking her over and tumbling into the distance. She hints that she is falling for him, which is a joke regarding Cueball's condition.\n\nThe baby shares his tendency to be pulled sideways by gravity, but this apparently does not start until she is born, because Megan and the doctor do not seem to have been expecting it.  If gravity had affected the unborn fetus in the same way, Megan would have been able to feel it, would have noticed that her uterus was hanging differently, and would have had difficulty balancing due to the sideways forces.  \n\nThe last panel is a reference to the opening scene of ''{{w|The Lion King}}'', called 'The Circle Of Life'.\n\nThe first part of the comic has some resemblance to this much later comic: [[1376: Jump]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball standing, with a dotted line perpendicular to him and a 30 degree angle going downwards.]\n:From a young age, gravity pulled him wrong.\n:[Cueball bouncing around his house.]\n:Sometimes east, sometimes west.
