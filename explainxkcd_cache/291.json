'Staples.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Beret Guy]] is hanging upside down in a tree, usually something you might have done in your childhood. As an adult, it is not considered very dignified. Most likely, [[White Hat]] made a comment on this and the fact that Beret Guy has his head down. But then, Beret Guy gives him an answer, regarding where White Hat's head once came through and asks him why he is still acting so {{w|dignified}}.\n\nHere, Beret Guy is referring to the process of {{w|childbirth}}. Put in the way he mentions said process, the fact that White Hat came into this world in such a fashion would be very humiliating.\n\nIn the title text, White Hat replies that he does not know, but then continues to ask why Beret Guy's beret stays on his head, even when upside down (in which gravity would tend to make a beret fall off). Beret Guy explains that he has stapled the beret onto his head. \n\nSuch a process is similar to that of closing a wound after major head surgery, using {{w|surgical staples}}. Normally, the stapling of the head would be conducted with anesthetic and removed after the incision has healed, and only an insane person would do this to himself. \nDoing this the way Beret Guy did it would be very, very, painful, and likely a bad idea.{{Citation needed}}\n\nBeret Guy is never seen without his hat (although it has been hidden under a green helmet once in [[769: War]]). And later in [[478: The Staple Madness]], it turns out that he likes to staple anything to everything, so maybe he also stapled his hat to his head. The staple madness comic may very well be a sequel to this comic [[262: IN UR REALITY]], where Black Hat implied that he had stapled stuff to cats in the title text. \n\nThis also means that White Hat was not born by {{w|C-section}}.\n\nIn the teaser trailer of Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, Indy [https://youtu.be/DZNlwJV5RRo?t=42 staples a hat to his head] (or at least pretends to) to prevent it from blowing off, a similar situation to the one Beret Guy is in here.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy swinging upside-down from a tree branch talking to White Hat walking by.]\n:Beret Guy: You were once shoved headfirst through someone's vagina.
