Many brands have a romanticized {{w|origin story}} on their packaging explaining the name or how they have a secret ingredient. Instead, this brand's origin story is a tale of petty one-upwomanship as the brand's founder sets out to prove that her cookies are better than her grandmother's.\n\nThe first paragraph lovingly describes the founder's memories of sitting in her grandmother's kitchen, watching her bake cookies. One would expect this to transition to a description of how delicious those cookies were, and a claim that her recipe became the basis for the cookies being offered for sale, as a family recipe or something similar. Instead, 'Amelia' insists that her grandmother's cookies were ''awful'', and insists that the goal of her company is to show how cookies are supposed to taste. This subversion of expectations breaks down the sense of nostalgia that's often used to market products, and publicly embarrasses her grandmother, turning a minor family squabble into a very public fight. Such is a very unusual strategy for convincing people to buy cookies, and would probably not work very well.\n\nTo complete her revenge, the \"story\" contains the grandmother's address. Creating false addresses for their mascots is often used as a publicity stunt for children to write testimonials to the brand's PR or marketing department. However, here it appears to be Amelia's actual Grandma's actual address, the goal being for her to receive thousands of letters on a regular basis about how her granddaughter's cookies are so great, while jabbing \"unlike yours!\", which could qualify as cyberbullying.\n\nIn retaliation, Amelia's grandmother has started submitting (presumably bogus) food safety complaints about Amelia's bakery to the health department in a ploy to overburden the bakery with unnecessarily frequent inspections. At one point Amelia eventually decided to offer a truce, which her grandmother emphatically rejected, underscoring it by sending Amelia an extra-large batch of the cookies she knows Amelia hates. Alternatively, she may be sending these cookies because she will submit a complaint after Amelia has received the cookies, as these cookies are potentially health code violations, as normal cookies do not have gooey exteriors.\n\nWhile the name of the city past the first letter and at least one of the zip code digits is too illegible to read, by process of elimination it is plausible that the city is Orlando and the zip code is 32841. However, 32841 is not a valid US zip code. No other location in Florida consists of one word starting with O and a zip code legibly close to the one in the comic. The problem is that the street clearly ends with \"Ln\" and the street name has neither {{w|Ascender (typography)|ascenders}} nor {{w|Descender (typography)|descenders}} other than the initial capital \"A\". This might recommend \"Anson Ln.\" but the street ''number'' starts with a 1 while the actual Anson Ln. has numbers all in the 4,000s. Similar problems arise for all of the streets with one or two ascenders/descenders or even with possible omitted letters or even entire words.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[What looks like the back of a package of cookies is shown.]\n\n:[Top left: Product logo.]\n:'''Amelia's''' Farm-Fresh ''Cookies''\n:[Parts of an oval surround the logo]\n\n:[Middle left: What appears to be a standard Nutrition Facts panel, though the details are illegible squiggles]\n\n:[Bottom left: What appears to be an ingredients list, though the details are illegible squiggles, and a few other squiggles]\n\n:[Right side:]\n:''Our Story''\n:Growing up on my grandma's farm, I spent so many cozy mornings in the kitchen, watching her take trays of fresh-baked cookies from the oven.\n:Her cookies were just ''awful''.\n:She used the finest ingredients. Eggs straight from the coop, stone-ground flour, hand-churned butter. But she squandered them. It's so sad. She told me I was too picky, but I know what cookies are supposed to taste like.\n:When I started a bakery, I vowed not to repeat her mistakes. These cookies won't fall apart in your hands. They have gooey centers, and slightly crisp exteriors, not the other way around, ''Grandma''. There's no mysterious gritty texture. Why would there be?\n:If you enjoy these cookies, please write to my grandma to let her know.\n:Thanks!\n:''Amelia''\n\n:[A partially legible squiggled address appears at the bottom left of the Our Story part of the box.
