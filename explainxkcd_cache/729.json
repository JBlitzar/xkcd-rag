They will chase the dot as it moves around, sometimes pouncing on it or swiping at it with their claws; but they will never be able to catch it.{{Citation needed}} This is very frustrating for cats (and dogs), because it triggers a hunting instinct, but removes the satisfaction of actually catching their prey.\n\nCueball is messing with his cat with a laser pointer, however he is unprepared when his cat pounces and successfully grabs the laser dot. As Cueball looks around and tries to figure out what happened to the laser, his cat licks it, before eating it and starting to glow with a red light.\n\nThe cat then shoots lasers from its eyes and disintegrates a surprised Cueball on the spot in revenge for taunting it with the laser pointer.\n\nIt is then revealed that everything that happened was just a cat's dream. Only in its dreams can a cat successfully enact the rest of the comic.{{Citation needed}}\n\nReal cats' eyes (and some other animals' eyes) have a {{w|tapetum lucidum}} behind their retinas, which increases their sensitivity in low-light conditions.  This can cause their eyes to appear to glow, but they're actually just reflecting light from the environment.\n\nThe title text makes a pun on the chamber in which lasers are formed, known as a {{w|laser cavity}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball points a laser pointer at the floor.
