In the 30 or so seconds it takes to dry the hands, the user may feel as though the air coming from the hand dryer isn't actually warm, hence seeming like they \"take forever to heat up.\"\n\n[[Randall]] is pointing out that {{w|evaporation}} is an endothermic process, which is why sweating cools you down and therefore why regular fans, which actually increase the air temperature through friction, can cause a cooling effect. With hand dryers, even though the air is warm, the cooling effect makes it feel cold. The user will be able to feel the heat only after their hands are dry.\n\nRandall has procured a small airplane, accompanied by a banner with a message explaining this phenomenon. He elaborates in the caption that he's spent dozens of years angry at the engineers of these hand dryers, as he was under the comic's erroneous impression that the air from the dryers was not actually warm. In an act of justice for hand dryer engineers everywhere, he now considers it his personal mission to explain to the public why this is actually a misconception. And indeed, it seems to be working - a person on the ground has already been [[1053: Ten Thousand|enlightened]] by Randall.\n\nIn the title text, the {{w|speed of sound}} is the speed of a sound wave in a given medium, usually air. Breaking the {{w|sound barrier}} is often touted as a significant achievement for powered aircraft (this was first safely achieved in the 1940s, and became significantly 'easier' with the development of the jet engine). Here, Randall thinks it would be a good idea to try and get the {{w|Dyson (company)|Dyson company}} (a technology company known for making high-tech and expensive air-moving devices) to design a hand dryer whose airflow would exceed the sound barrier. Dyson's marketing often turns on the very high speed of the airflow produced by their motors, often many hundreds of kilometres per hour, indeed approaching the speed of sound. However, there are side effects of supersonic airflow, including {{w|sonic booms}}, which would make it impractical for purposes of drying hands in an enclosed area.\n\nThis comic is not the only one to involve people flying banner planes to inform people on technologically related things: see also [[1965: Background Apps]].\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[An airplane tows a banner.
