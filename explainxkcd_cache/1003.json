I like Steve!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is a take on the anti-homosexual refrain, used often at those sorts of rallies \"God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve\" (or \"Anna and Eve\"). This refrain is used to support the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman because in the {{w|Old Testament}} God created a man and a woman to start the human race. {{w|Adam and Eve}} are in the story in the Bible of the creation ({{w|Book of Genesis}}), and are the first pair of humans, created by God.\n\nAdam walks in on Eve having sexual relations with {{w|Cain and Abel|Abel}}, who is Adam's son, which turns the joke from a homosexual one into an incest one.\n\nIn the title text, Adam continues that he would have preferred walking in on Abel and Steve. As well as probably no longer needing to be irked at the surprise involvement of his presumed spouse, and mother to his son, Adam seems not to have a homophobic prejudice (or less of one). Unlike those who use the contemporary version of the phrase. What's more, he doesn't personally dislike Steve in general and possibly considers him one of the better partners available at this time.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Adam, portrayed as Cueball, has his palms out.]\n:Adam: It's '''''Adam''''' and '''''Eve''''', not '''''Abel''''' and '''''Eve!!'''''\n\n:[Caption below panel:] \n:Adam was freaked out by what he'd just walked in on.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Religion]]"
