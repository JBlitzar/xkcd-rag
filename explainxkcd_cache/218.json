The console was deliberately designed this way so that it wouldn't look like a regular video-game console (and wouldn't be associated with the still-fresh stigma of the video-game crash only two years previous), but it caused no end of pain for people wanting to play the games. It would work fine for about two years, but after that \"cartridge tilt\" would become a problem as either the game's or the console's electric contacts could become misaligned.\n\nA ubiquitous fix for this problem among gamers was to take the cartridge out, blow into it, and put it back inside, all to clean out any dust inside the cartridge that would make \"cartridge tilt\" worse and occur more frequently. This was not a recommended solution by Nintendo of America, and didn't always work, but it worked frequently enough to enter gamer culture, and even today, people who had the NES as children remember having to do that. Some posit the act of cartridge reinsertion alone contributes most of the curative effect with the blowing only giving comfort/satisfaction value to the user if not introducing potentially harmful moisture as well. The NES was 22 years old as of the date this comic was written. Someone who was 10 years old when they got their Nintendo for Christmas could ''very well'' be old enough in 2007 to have attained their doctorate degree, and so this comic hearkens back to the aforementioned cartridge fix by suggesting that a heart surgeon might try that on a real-life heart patient. And like the introduction states, that ''is'' a scary thought.\n\nThe title text is one of many xkcd references to the terrifying ''[[velociraptor|Velociraptor]]'' predator from the dinosaur movie ''{{w|Jurassic Park}}.''\n\n==Transcript==\n:Scary Thought #137: The NES came out over two decades ago. Those kids are all grown-ups now.\n:[Two surgeons are in an operating room, leaning over a patient.]\n:First Surgeon: He's going into cardiac arrest. Stand by for defibrillation.\n:Second Surgeon: Wait. First let's try taking out the heart, blowing into the ventricles, and putting it back in.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Medicine]]\n[[Category:Velociraptors]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Comics to make one feel old]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
