New York-style pizza is characterized by a distinctly thin, and flexible crust. Slices are intended to be eaten by hand, and are wide and flexible enough to typically be eaten folded (as opposed to being narrow and stiff enough to not ''need'' folding). Chicago-style pizza is cooked in a cast-iron dish, resulting in a very thick crust, which is topped with melted cheese, and sauce and toppings are added above the cheese. <sup>&#91;[[Talk:3142: (City)-Style Pizza#pizzas|''ongoing&nbsp;discussion'']]&#93;</sup>\n\nThis comic contains a chart that compares the tastiness of pizza styles with the size of the city in the name. They generally span a broad range, and the upper limit tends to be pretty consistent, suggesting that cities of all sizes can produce good pizza. The smallest cities are shown as having the least possibility for a good pizza named after them. The apex is shown as being for mid-sized cities toward the smaller end of the spectrum. This suggests that the best regional variant comes from a smaller city, though [[Randall]] doesn't specify which one. \n\nThe lower end of the range shows much more variation. The largest cities are shown as being incapable of having bad pizza as their specialty, with the worst examples still being okay. The smaller the cities are, the more potential there is for a bad pizza to qualify for the name. This may be due to the fact that large cities tend to have many restaurants. As a result, there is more chance of one of them producing a decent variant, and more competition for which one will become synonymous with the city. Smaller cities with fewer eating options might accept lower quality choices because they lack options.\n\nAt the lowest end of the range are very small cities with terrible regional pizza. The caption jokes that this is to due to \"bored restaurant owners\" deliberately making up bad pizza varieties as a \"fun prank\" on visitors. The implication is that some local pizza styles are so bad that they could only have been created as a joke, and even the people who created them don't think they're appealing. \n\nNew York-style pizza is indicated at the top of the city size axis (New York City being the largest city in the US), and near the top of the tastiness axis, but in the middle of the range of cities of its size. New York City is where pizza was first popularized in the US, having been brought by Italian immigrants in the 19th century. The style from New York has been highly influential over pizza throughout the country, and is generally acknowledged to be appealing to most people (though New Yorkers may take issue with the suggestion that their pizza is not, in fact, the best). \n[[File:2023 Altoona Pizza from Dino’s.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|An {{w|Altoona-style pizza}}.]]\nThe title text gives a specific example of a terrible pizza from a small city, describing {{w|Altoona-style pizza}} as \"true audacity\". Created in the Altoona Hotel in {{w|Altoona, Pennsylvania}}, it has a thick square of bread-like Sicilian-style crust, covered with tomato sauce, bell peppers, and salami and a slice of American cheese. Not only does Randall implicitly find this to be highly unappetizing, but considers it audacious to even call it pizza. The structure of this dish is very odd for pizza (looking more like an open-faced sandwich), the toppings are eccentric, and the use of American cheese to top pizza is so strange as to border on culinary heresy. This is presumably the type of \"pizza\" that Randall believes could only be created as a joke.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph.]\n:[The x and y axes have no unit markings, and are labeled:]\n::[X axis: City size]\n::[Y axis: Tastiness of \"<city>-style pizza\"]\n\n:[A shaded region is bounded by a lower bound and an upper bound.

It reads \"&lt;City&gt;-Style Pizza\", which can be interpreted by web browsers and scrapers as containing an HTML tag for a \"City\" element for some unknown semantic/formatting effect. Being not {{w|Document type definition|defined}} or implemented, this 'tag' ends up being ignored and the remaining content is rendered as just \"-Style Pizza\". It is not the [[3015: D&D Combinatorics|first]] [[3028: D&D Roll|time]] that Randall has accidentally clashed with HTML-rendering issues. The \"<\" and \">\" signs are not supported on [[explain xkcd|this wiki]] and other wikis due to {{w|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (technical restrictions)|a technical restriction on page titles}}, so the wiki's pagename for this comic's explanation doesn't precisely match the official title.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category: Food]]\n[[Category: Charts]]"
