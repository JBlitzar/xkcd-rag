However, the comic typically detours into strange, ridiculous or pop-culture-referencing footprints. In order:\n\n*The first panel is a regular cat, which is not unusual and relatively easy to find and recognize the tracks of.{{Citation needed}}\n*\"Moose and squirrel\" is a reference to the cartoon ''{{w|Rocky and Bullwinkle}}''. Rocky and Bullwinkle were a flying squirrel and a moose, respectively, and were frequently referred to as \"moose and squirrel\" by the show's antagonist Boris Badenov.\n*[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/longcat Longcat] is an internet {{w|meme}} from pictures of cats all stretched out that make them look very tall (or long).\n*\"Mouse riding Bicycle\" is a reference to ''{{w|Ralph S. Mouse}}'', a series of novels by {{w|Beverly Cleary}}.\n*The hair dryer has melted an irregular region around the rabbit. The title text is a pun on the Rabbit with a hair dryer frame, possibly an homage to {{w|Looney Tunes}}, where shows with {{w|Bugs Bunny}} would often contain a pun on the {{w|Leporidae|closely related term}} of \"hare\".\n*{{w|Legolas}} is a reference to the character in the ''{{w|Lord of the Rings}}'' trilogy of books and movies. Legolas, as an elf, was so light-footed he could walk on top of snow, while the other races in his party were forced to trudge through it.\n*The \"Bobcat on pogo stick\" panel is a possible reference to the character Bonkers D. Bobcat from {{w|Bonkers (American TV series)|Bonkers}}\n*The \"Knight\" panel is a {{w|chess}} reference, as the tracks move just like the knight piece in chess.\n*The \"kid with...\" panels are a reference to ''{{w|Calvin and Hobbes}}'', a comic strip written by Bill Watterson. In it, Calvin has a pet tiger named Hobbes, and sometimes, a cardboard box that \"transmogrifies\" him to something else. In this panel we see tiger prints, meaning that Calvin became a tiger like Hobbes.\n*The same cardboard box is now tipped on its side instead of upside down in the last panel. Now it functions as a duplicator, making multiple copies of whatever is in it. Calvin goes into it, duplicates himself, and they walk and duplicate again, and the cycle repeats.\n*{{w|Prius}} is a reference to current events in which Toyota Prius's pedals have allegedly malfunctioned causing accidents. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/business/global/04prius.html]\n*The {{w|Higgs Boson}} is an {{w|elementary particle}} which, at the time this strip was posted, had not yet been officially discovered (there had been detections at the Tevatron with 4 sigma certainty since the early 2000s). It was tentatively detected in March 2013 in the {{w|Large Hadron Collider}}. The “prints” in the snow in this case humorously resemble the tracks made by elementary particles following a collision of the kind used to search for the Higgs boson in a {{w|particle collider}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:BACKYARD SNOW TRACKING GUIDE\n\n:[Each panel contains an overhead view of tracks through the snow, with a caption indicating the apparent source.]\n\n:[Standard paw prints through the snow.]\n:CAT\n\n:[Large split-toe tracks and smaller rodent tracks.]\n:MOOSE AND SQUIRREL\n\n:[Cat prints, but with more space between the pairs of prints.]\n:LONGCAT\n\n:[Two similar careening tire tracks.]\n:MOUSE RIDING BICYCLE\n\n:[Longer tracks, with a large melted ring surrounding a point in the middle of the frame.]\n:RABBIT STOPPING TO USE HAIR DRYER\n\n:[No visible tracks.]\n:LEGOLAS\n\n:[Single deep holes with cratering.]\n:BOBCAT ON POGO STICK\n\n:[Round prints that suddenly turn to the right halfway into frame.]\n:KNIGHT\n\n:[Human footprints up to a square melting pattern, turning into animal prints.]\n:KID WITH TRANSMOGRIFIER\n\n:[Human footprints up to a rectangular melted area, which are then doubled to another rectangular area, which are then doubled again up to another rectangular area, which are then doubled.]\n:KID WITH DUPLICATOR\n\n:[Right curve on a road, with tire tracks careening out of frame.]\n:Out of Frame Garden Owner: MY VEGETABLE GARDEN!\n:PRIUS\n\n:[A series of spiraling and outwardly traveling lines extend from a point in the middle of the frame.]\n:HIGGS BOSON\n\n== Trivia ==\n* A section of this comic, along with its title text, is used as the image for {{tvtropes|AltText|Alt Text}} on TV Tropes.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Calvin and Hobbes]]\n[[Category:Bobcats]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:LOTR]]\n[[Category:Chess]]"
