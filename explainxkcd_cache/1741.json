See explanation of [[#Individual design elements|individual design elements]] below. \n\nThe joke centers around the fact that most people in modern times are constantly surrounded with human-built objects, which we generally use without giving them much thought. [[Randall]] implies that he occasionally imagines what went into seemingly simple objects around him (in this case his desk and the water glass and the desk lamp on top of it), and finds it overwhelming. This is because there are so many built items around us, many of which are inexpensive and mass-produced, which nonetheless resulted from a great deal of human effort. \n\nThis is similar to the thesis of the classic essay ''[http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html I, Pencil]'', except that while ''I, Pencil'' idealizes manufacture and commerce to argue for the free market and against regulation, the comic focuses on details that are far more human or based in bureaucratic or government red tape.\n\nPresumably, this kind of realization is more likely for people who've worked in design and engineering, like Randall, because they have some insight into what's involved in bringing a product to market. Also people who sit around all day wondering what could be funny, like Randall, could also end up in such a thought spiral. The comment about California recalls is based on the tags on products that often state [http://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65 \"This item has been known by the state of California to cause...\"]\n\nThere's a double joke in the title as the first thing most people will think of, when seeing such a table with a typical desk lamp, is that this is a ''work desk'' rather than about all the '''work''' put into making the desk and lamp. The potential implication is that Randall is so distracted imagining the work that went into creating his workspace that he can't get his own work done, hence the title. (Interestingly, but without being related to this comic, the next comic was called [[1742: Will It Work|1742: Will It '''Work''']]).\n\nThe argument over putting the switch on the cord getting someone fired hits on another aspect of the design issue. Companies that design and manufacture goods will inevitably have human conflicts, where decisions will be argued over, and human personalities and office politics will impact the final design. \n\nIn the title text Randall states that this incidence is imaginary (based on his imagination) but still he has apparently come up with an entire fictional narrative about the conflict over whether to put the lamp's switch on the lamp body itself, or to attach it to the lamp's power cord. And now he has SUCH a strong opinion about the firing incident. \n\nThis may be because he already had a strong opinion about who was right, which could make him angry if that person was the one getting fired. Randall's distaste for lamps where the switch is on the cord was mentioned in the title text of [[1036: Reviews]]. As the lamp on this desk is with the switch on the cord, and as it seems Randall really dislikes such lamps, this would make sense, as it would probably be the one wishing to put the switch on the body who were fired. Alternatively it could have been the one who put the switch on the wire that was fired later, when they got poor on-line reviews... \n\nUsing the lamp as shown on this desk would make it annoying with the switch on the cord, as it will be hard to reach under the table, when sitting at the desk. Often such lamps have the switch either at the main body or on the head of the lamp. That would make it easy to reach it while sitting at the desk.\n\nA similar theme of the unseen contributions of engineers is found in [[277: Long Light]], including the title text: \"You can look at practically any part of anything manmade around you and think 'some engineer was frustrated while designing this.' It's a little human connection.\" This fits in well with Randall's annoyance with a switch on the cord, as he might believe it was a frustrated engineer that is the cause of such an inconvenient placement of the switch. \n\n===Individual design elements===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Individual Design Elements\n!Description\n!Explanation\n|-\n|An engineer worked late drawing this curve in AutoCAD || {{w|AutoCAD}} is a popular software package for doing computer-aided design. Curves in three dimensions are notable for being much more difficult than straight lines, this curve in particular must be revolved around an axis, and the engineer would need to ensure it correctly interfaces with the remainder of the body.\n|-\n|Extra vents added to avoid California safety recall || Lamps can get very hot, especially if an {{w|incandescent bulb}} is installed, possibly causing injury if the shade is touched.  Additional vents can improve air circulation, allowing the lamp to run cooler.  The US state of {{w|California}} is known for its [http://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65 many safety regulations]. California is notable for having strict safety requirements for every product, to the point that Disneyland's front entrance was [https://thebigdiseasey.wordpress.com/tag/disneyland/ recently required to have a cancer warning].\n|-\n|9 hours of meetings || Any product development requires several meetings about coordination for any aspect of the design, especially critical ones that can affect other subsystems in the device, such as the flexible stem in this lamp. Its size is affected by the wiring requirements, strength requirements, intersections with both the base and the lamp head. The material, properties, color, manufacturing process, and so on also have to be determined for something as simple as this.\n|-\n|Ongoing debate || Designers frequently disagree about what is important enough to be put on the label, where the label needs to be put, which laws apply, and so on.\n|-\n|Years-long negotiation with glass supplier || Many products have to go through many stages of negotiations before the company can have the required supplies to build the product. This is a commentary on how long it takes to negotiate with other supplier businesses about things that the average consumer sees trivial: it ''can'' take months or years when outsourcing to determine and contract which kind of glass, how much, what price, what happens when base materials change in price, what other kinds of glass are acceptable, what compounds are allowed around the glass during production, etc. etc.\n|-\n|4 hours of meetings || It takes several meetings for the design team to fully determine and justify what size is best for the market, and to relay this information to the rest of the company. Then, they receive feedback on what is or isn't acceptable, frequently by people who don't know exactly ''why'', so they have to return again for another meeting for further clarification.\n|-\n|Months of tip-over testing || The thicker the base of a glass is, the lower its center of gravity is, and the heavier it is. A balance between stability and ease of handling must be reached. In addition, testing generally takes longer than the consumer expects, and every variation must be tested to determine which one performs the most acceptably.\n|-\n|Wood source changed due to 20 year legal fight over logging in the Great Bear rainforest || The {{w|Great Bear Rainforest}} is a temperate rainforest on the central coast of {{w|British Columbia}}, {{w|Canada}}.  The government of British Columbia recently announced an agreement to protect 85% of this forest from commercial logging.\n|-\n|Argument over putting switch on cord got someone fired || Some people can become quite passionate about whether a particular feature is, on balance, a convenience or an annoyance. If the designers cannot find a compromise or reach consensus, the supervisor may decide that the time spent on these disagreements outweighs the value of the passionate designers. Randall's distaste for lamps with the switch on the cord has been mentioned in the title text of [[1036: Reviews]].\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A table is shown with a glass of water to the left and a lamp standard type desk lamp on the right. There are nine labels in relation to different parts of these three items. For each label, one or two arrows points to the relevant part. Five labels are written above the table, two on the table and two below the table between the front legs. These last two labels are causing the table legs to the rear to disappear, and also cuts the lamp cord, going beneath the table, in two. Below each label will be written under a description of what they point to going in normal reading order from left to right, two lines above, one line on and one line below the table.]\n\n:[Arrow points a line that follow the curve of the lamps shade]\n:An engineer worked late drawing this curve in AutoCAD\n\n:[Arrow points to back of lamp shade just above the stem.
