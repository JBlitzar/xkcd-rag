Note: if he had downloaded Wikipedia using a tool like [https://kiwix.org/ Kiwix], he could have appeared smarter even when Wikipedia was down.\n\nThe title, {{w|Extended_mind_thesis|\"Extended Mind\"}}, refers to a theory proposed by philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers, which postulates that the mind not only includes what can be found in the skull, but also incorporates external things, like Wikipedia. Others have connected this sort of thing to the innate biological intelligence, or knowledge, but still consider it a different phenomenon under a label such as \"{{w|Extelligence|''ex''telligence}}\".\n\nThe title text refers to an observed phenomenon that many of Wikipedia's page links eventually lead to the {{w|Philosophy}} page, though he incorrectly states that this happens on all articles. This may be due to the fact that the first few links in any article tend to reference more general or abstract ideas, which eventually gravitate towards philosophy. This is only true for around 95% of Wikipedia pages: the rest end up in infinite loops, missing pages, or pages without links. As of 12:08 UTC on April 12, 2024, the Philosophy page leads into a loop containing the pages {{w|Existence}} and {{w|Reality}}.\n\nMore info on this bizarre characteristic of the encyclopedia can be found {{w|Wikipedia:Getting to Philosophy|on their page about it}} or on [http://matpalm.com/blog/2011/08/13/wikipedia-philosophy/ this blog].\n\nAs an example path (as of September 30, 2025), a main page article was on the 2025 Ryder Cup. Following the algorithm from here, one gets Golf, Sport, Physical activity, Skeletal muscle, Vertebrate, Animal, Multicellular organism, Organism, Life, Matter, Classical physics, Scientific theory, Universe, Space, Three-dimensional space, Geometry, Mathematics, Theory, Rationalism, Philosophy.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[An IM window is open over a Chrome window with tabs for Spark Plug, Feeler Gauge, and Wikipedia.]\n:Message with Mike1979\n:Mike1979: I replaced my spark plugs and now my car is running weird.\n:Me: The spark gap might be off.\n:Me: You can check with a feeler gauge.\n:Mike1979: What should the gap be?\n:Me: Usually between 0.035\" and 0.070\".\n:Me: But it depends on the engine.\n\n:[An IM window is open over a Chrome window with a single Wikipedia tab, marked ERROR.

I changed it to 242 (a) because I try not to get too specific with those things, and didn't want people poking the actual machine at .243 (if it was still there) - I actually considered putting .276 and seeing how many people noticed, but figured they'd just think I made a dumb mistake. and (b) as part of this ancient inside joke involving the number 242 ...\"\n\n*For a few weeks after this comic came out, following the links as explained in the title text would actually lead only to the Science page, due to someone/someones altering the links.  The alterations could have been coincidental, good-faith edits, but were much more likely to be vandalism to break this trick.  The edits were eventually reverted, and, as of July 2016, all first links lead to the ocean.  Er, Philosophy. At least, when they're not stuck in endless loops.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]"
