You pilot a small spaceship throughout a vast area in space exploring various bodies and planets within the play area, many containing easter eggs alluding to the book What If? 2 and previous xkcd comics. The flight mechanics are Newtonian so the spaceship can use the gravity of planets to alter its trajectory or enter orbit. The spaceship has indicator circles around it which appear when a gravitational body comes into range, showing the direction towards their center of gravity and the size of the body. A circle also appears around the spaceship whenever it collides with a gravitational body, acting as a shield. The shield remains until the player orients the spaceship upright so its landing gear can deploy.\n\nYou can easily fly between planets if you pay attention to orbital mechanics: don't just floor the accelerator. The background stars show your velocity and orientation relative to the nearest gravity well.  If you are having difficulties navigating space, point towards a gravity orb and accelerate for only a few seconds. Wait until the background stars spin wildly, and then reduce your velocity to 0 before gently accelerating towards the object.\n\nWith a keyboard the arrow keys rotate the spaceship and accelerate it forward and backward. You can also use the standard first-person shooter keys 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd', and the standard vi text editor navigation keys 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' to control the spaceship. Despite some spaceships having no unique backward texture, they can all reverse. On mobile the comic will full screen, pressing either side of the center rotates the spaceship, and pressing in the center accelerates it forward. Various additional glitches may occur if you're playing on mobile. Having a starting position slightly below the take-off pad means you're already 'glitched' inside the planet from the off. Escaping the planet may need inverted 'accelerating' (turning perpendicular to the local vertical and thrusting backwards until you can glitch back out into more open space. You may also be trapped within the cannonball 'orbit', with seemingly inconsistent collision-detection, such that you can be sat ''with landing gear extended'' upon features (projectile tracks, etc) that seem not to count as solid for most other purposes.\n\nThere is no \"universal\" point of view — the bottom of the window, \"down\", is oriented towards the object exerting the most gravity upon the player. Multiple things found in this comic draw attention to this, such as how on Earth Ponytail says to White Hat, \"I checked downforeveryoneorjustme.com and it says just me\", and he replies \"Yeah, I guess down isn't down for everyone.\" Throughout the play area are coins that change the spaceship into different rockets and non-space-based vehicles.\n\n=== Celestial Bodies ===\nThis is a table of all the celestial bodies found in the comic.<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Explanation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Transcript\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Tiles (X, Y)\n! colspan=\"4\" |References\n|-\n![[what if?

While this makes it technically a relatively easy integration problem (of the position of the player ship forward in time), the integrator used seems to be a relatively simple one, but certainly not a simplistic one, because it does not conserve angular momentum. This can be seen when one manages to get into orbit around some object, e.g., the core of the sun. The orbit slowly decays over time.\n\n* The logic for extending the landing legs and landing is rather simple. A ship can (normally) land if it is facing away from the surface it collides with, and if its momentum is more-or-less directed towards the surface. Once landing is triggered, the ship will rotate to face directly away from the object exerting the most gravity on the player, regardless of how sloped the surface is. The only way to get into space again is to accelerate forwards, as neither turning nor accelerating backwards cancels the landed state. All of this can be abused to land on almost everything. To land on the underside of an object, simply point your ship away from the object and slowly accelerate backwards to counteract the force of gravity. Landing on the side of an object is more difficult, as ships cannot accelerate sideways. The first method is to accelerate backwards to launch yourself upwards and towards the object so that at the top of your arc you will collide with the object. Then, rotate your ship accordingly to land. Method two is to just repeatedly slam your back of your ship into the object until you land. Note that with any of these weird landing methods, your ship will turn to face away from the source of gravity and can clip into objects.\n\n* Executing <code>window.python(\"import antigravity\")</code> or <code>python(\"import antigravity\")</code> as Javascript on the page will reverse gravity, multiplying the gravity constant by -1.\n\n* Executing <code>window.ze.goggles()</code> or <code>ze.goggles()</code> as Javascript on the page will show a warning in the console: \"<code>they do nothing!</code>\"\n\n* Ponytail's comment on earth that she \"checked downforeveryoneorjustme.com and it said just me\" may be referencing the actual website at that domain, which checks if other websites are down.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Book promotion]]\n[[Category:Interactive comics]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:The Little Prince]]\n[[Category:Bobcats]]\n[[Category:Dynamic comics]]\n[[Category:Comics with animation]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:What If?]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]"
