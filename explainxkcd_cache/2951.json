It came about 11 months after the sixth [[2807: Bad Map Projection: ABS(Longitude)]] (#152), and was followed 3.5 months later by [[2999: Bad Map Projection: The United Stralia]] (#102).\n\n[[File:Exterior_Kansas_Azimuthal_Projection.png|thumb|left|Projection of the world from the same perspective as the comic. This uses an azimuthal equidistant projection, so distances from the center point (39°50′S 98°35′E) are correct but areas are distorted.]]\n\nThis comic portrays an unusual projection of a map of the contiguous United States based loosely on an {{w|azimuthal projection}}. Maps of individual countries are common, especially in academic settings. It is typical for such maps, which only display a limited area of the globe, to use a projection that does not severely distort the shape of the country or its internal borders, but a country that is large enough (as with the United States) will always noticeably suffer from certain distortions of at least one element chosen from distances, areas or angles. This usually occurs at its extremities (though some projections can be made more faithful to its extremities at the expense of distorting its interior). \n\nHere, however, [[Randall]] has opted for a much different projection. Rather than placing the geographical center of the country in the middle and the borders on the outside, this map has gone the opposite direction, with the border of the US toward the center, and the geographical center of the contiguous US (Kansas) and surrounding states distorted to surround the entire map. This, understandably, results in the shape of both the national and state borders being largely unrecognizable as it effectively puts ''every'' bit of the chosen map features out towards the distorted extremities. Much of the internal area of Kansas itself (should one wish to display further internal features) may be located far beyond the comic's edges, perhaps even to infinitely far away on the projected plane.\n\n[[File:Azimuthal_equidistant_projection_SW.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Polar {{w|azimuthal equidistant projection}}, as on the {{w|flag of the United Nations}}, but with an \"exterior Antarctica\"]]\n\nIf Alaska and Hawaii were present in this map and represented in geographically accurate locations (as opposed to inset, as is common in many maps of the United States), Alaska would in the upper right of the empty space, between Minnesota and Washington, while Hawaii would be in the center to the right, off the coast of California. Both would be rather small, with Hawaii particularly compressed (to an extent dictated by the exact projection method used).\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that {{w|Geographic center of the United States#Contiguous United States|the geographic center of the contiguous United States}} is within Kansas. This map projection instead causes Kansas to show up as the exterior of the US, which makes it the outer edge.\n\nThe statement that ''topologists now believe it's actually their outer edge'' plays with the notion that map projections influence your perspective on the world, as it is known to be the case with more familiar examples like Mercator vs. Gall-Peters projections, or world maps with the South Pole on top and so on. Similarly, or so the claim goes, any notions of interior and edge may just be a matter of perspective.\nIf you were to enclose a small square in four walls, but define this to be the outside, you'd effectively create a roofless building of which the floor area encompasses almost the entire surface of the Earth (minus the small square) - see ''So Long And Thanks For All The Fish'' by Douglas Adams for a classic example of this gag. Randall has always been fond of exploring how map projections influence our perspective both in a parodistic way and by playing it straight, e.g. in: [[503: Terminology]], [[977: Map Projections]], or [[2838: Dubious Islands]]\n\n[[File:now.gif|325px|thumb|left|The map in [[1335: Now]] shows an exterior {{w|Arctic Ocean}} and Antarctica in the center]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Map description could be improved?
