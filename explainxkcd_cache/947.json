This contrasts to {{w|simple interest}}, where the amount used to calculate the interest will always stay at a fixed value. In economics classes, many teachers like to demonstrate extreme examples of compound interest, typically turning a thousand dollars into tens of thousands thanks to unrealistically high interest rates over several decades. But here, Ponytail discovers that a more realistic example is less than overwhelming. Instead of simple interest of 2% earning $200 in ten years, with compounding $219 is produced, hardly any better on a $1000 investment.\n\nThere is an urban legend that Einstein said that compounding interest is the most powerful force. {{w|Snopes}} has its [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp doubts about it].\n\nThe idea in the title text that people take advice from physicists making small talk is also referenced in [[799: Stephen Hawking]] and [[1206: Einstein]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:Ponytail: Sure, 2% interest may not ''seem'' like a lot. But it's ''compound''!\n\n:[Ponytail turns around and opens a computer on a previously unseen desk and begins calculating.]\n:Ponytail: If you invest $1,000 now, in just ten short years you'll have...\n:Ponytail: ...let's see...\n\n:Ponytail: ...$1,219.\n\n:Ponytail: Ok, so compound interest isn't some magical force.\n:Megan: Yeah, I'm just gonna try to make more money.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Money]]"
