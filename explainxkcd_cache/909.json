If I'm escaping from a submarine at 50 meters, then I'll *definitely* need a flashlight to find air pockets for gradual decompression on the way up. Time to start shopping professional dive lights.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nFor most people, under most circumstances, a flashlight's water-resistance is a completely moot point, as most flashlight use occurs on dry land. But, [[208|as Randall has shown before]], there is a tendency for people to imagine elaborate scenarios in which an extra edge would be useful.\n\nIn the dream sequence over the first 2 and a half frames, [[Cueball]] appears to be diving to find a key underwater, which he spots using his flashlight when he is at 8 meters. His flashlight goes out at 10 meters because he bought the \"Hi-Brite\" model. The dream sequence also references a \"radio shed\", which were only really used in the past for {{w|amateur radio}}s or some other military style bases/compoundsâ€”which would align with his \"warn the President\" line. He thus suggests the more water-resistant flashlight. However, this is seen as ridiculous from his friend, since the more durable model costs over $25 more in return. He replies that \"you never know\" what situation you'll be in.\n\nThe title text takes Cueball's thought process to the next level. If he is getting a flashlight that works to 40 meters (worst-case), he should probably be prepared for even deeper waters as well (even worse-case).\n\nThis comic is similar to [[761: DFS]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is diving in very deep, dark blue water. He shines a flashlight at the sea floor.]\n:Cueball (thinks): Eight meters. There's the wreckage... Yes! I see the key!\n\n:[As he swims further toward it, his flashlight starts to cut out.]\n:Cueball (thinks): Gotta grab it, surface, get in to the radio shed, and warn the President! Just a few more...\n:Flashlight: BZZT FIZZ\n\n:[This panel has no border like the others, and is divided in half diagonally by a thought bubble.]\n:[The left half of it is a dark blue thought bubble with the diver inside it. On the right hand side are packaged flashlights hanging on a shelf. The one called Hi-Brite is $24.95 and is labeled \"water resistant to 10 meters.\" The one called \"FenStar G6\" is $49.95 and says \"water resistant to 40 meters.\"]\n:Cueball (thinks): Oh no.\n\n:[Cueball and a friend stand in front of a flashlight display in a store. Cueball looks down at the packages with his hand on his chin in thought. The thought bubble from the previous panel leads from his head. The friend stands behind him.]\n:Cueball: ...maybe I should spring for the deeper water resistance.\n:Friend: Why on earth would you care about that?\n:Cueball: Look, you never know.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
