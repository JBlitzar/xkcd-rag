Archimedes was illustrating the power of {{w|force}} multiplication by pointing out that the theoretical force that could be exerted by a {{w|lever}} is unlimited. In principle, an arbitrarily large force could be exerted by a single human with a lever of sufficient length (that also assumes that the lever is arbitrarily strong and rigid, and that the fulcrum is arbitrarily strong and stable). Obviously, this couldn't be taken as a practical proposal, but merely a demonstration of theory. \n\nHere, [[Cueball]] begins as if he is quoting Archimedes, but then produces a gun and threatens to execute hostages if he does not receive the lever. This turns a statement of a thought experiment to an actual demand, connected to a serious threat. It's not clear what \"long enough\" means in this context, possibly he's trying to enact Archimedes experiment for real. In any case, he's apparently sufficiently determined to have taken hostages and to threaten to murder them. This may be a stealth pun on the term \"leverage\", as the threat of killing hostages is used to provide leverage to have the hostage taker's demands met. Of course, the leverage provided by a physical lever and the concept of leverage in terms of a negotiation are two wildly different ideas despite the similar name.\n\nThe title text references another famous proverb, \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\" The quote starts out the same, but again ends with a sentence that is more fitting for an action movie.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing normally.]\n:Cueball: In the words of Archimedes,\n\n:[Cueball extends his left arm slightly.]\n:Cueball: Give me a long enough lever and a place to rest it\n\n:[Cueball is now holding a gun in his right hand.]\n:Cueball: Or I will kill one hostage every hour.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
