[[Randall]] apparently ''really'' does not like these stickers and states that when he becomes president, any and all displays of stickers bearing the phrase (like the one on the locker in the comic) will be considered a felony, though skateboarding itself will still be legal.\n\nThe title text also shows another protest phrase, \"Arrest me, I'm a skateboarder,\" that Randall hates even more than \"skateboarding is not a crime.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A set of lockers, that are dark pink, blue, yellow, dark pink then blue. The middle one has a white sticker stuck to it proclaiming \"Skateboarding is not a crime.\"]\n:[Outside of the Box] When I'm president, skateboarding will still be legal, but display of those stupid stickers will be a felony.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
