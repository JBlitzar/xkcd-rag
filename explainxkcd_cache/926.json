[[Cueball]] notices that his Cueball-like friend is followed by a time vulture, making the exclamation '' Dude, you've got a time vulture.''\n\nThe primary food source for {{w|Vulture|vultures}} is carrion, or rotting meat. A time vulture, as explained by Cueball, is a type of vulture that can live for {{w|Millennium|millennia}} (i.e. thousands of years), spending very little energy and it can even slow down its internal clocks so time speeds past, a kind of forward time travel, to the point where its prey dies. In this way, it can thus always wait long enough for the prey to die of natural causes no matter how long it takes, as seen from the prey's point of view. So in principle they kill their prey by using aging, as Cueball explains, although in fact, like any vulture, they just find prey that has already (almost) died, as from their point of view every living thing is just about to die. But as with other vultures, they do not participate in the actual killing. Time vultures thus just need to locate and find any one living creature (of a reasonable size), which then becomes its prey as it then just waits until it dies, spending hardly any energy while it waits. Real {{w|List of soaring birds|soaring}} vultures can also stay afloat for considerable time spans without actually using any energy as they just {{w|Lift (soaring)|float}} on {{w|thermals}}.\n\nThus the time vulture will now keep soaring over Cueballâ€™s friends head for the rest of his life, and then when he dies (whenever and of whichever cause), it will descend and feast on his carcass. This should, in principle, not make any difference to the friend, since most people already live with the knowledge that they will eventually die, and that their body will end up being destroyed one way or another. \n\nAnd because the time vulture can slow down its internal clock, in its point of view, everyone who ever says \"But, I'm not about to die\" (or anything else, really), would say so right before they die. In humans' point of view, it could be many years after the statement was made, but for the time vulture, a human lifespan only lasts a mere moment.  \n\nIt is thus really more of a philosophical comic about the fact that we all have death waiting for us, you could say it soars above our head and just wait for it to happen. And in relation to the {{w|deep time}} of the geology of the Earth or the expansion of the universe, the time it takes for people to live their lives is hardly worth mentioning...\n\nIn the title text it is stated that all real life vultures are actually a kind of time vultures, as real life vultures also sometimes spot a dying animal, not quite dead yet, and then wait for this prey to die. But time vultures are able to wait for many years for their prey to die, whereas regular vultures do not have that kind of time, before they need to feed or land, thus the comment that some vultures have more patience than others.\n\nReal vultures and their preying habits were referenced in [[1746: Making Friends]], directly in the title text.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is watching a large black bird, with apparently fractal wings, which hovers above his Cueball-like friend who walks towards Cueball and now turns to look at the bird over his shoulder.]\n:Cueball: Dude, you've got a Time Vulture.\n:Friend: Holy crap! What is it?\n\n:[Zoom-in on Cueball who now looks at his friend who are now standing close to Cueball looking up at the bird off-panel.]\n:Cueball: They're predators that use aging to kill prey.\n:Friend: Huh? What do you mean?\n\n:[The panel zooms in on the Cueball's face. The friends reply comes from off-panel.]\n:Cueball: They live for millennia and use little energy. They can slow down their internal clocks so time speeds past. To hunt, they lock on to some prey, and when it stops moving, they eat it.\n:Friend (off-panel): But what if the prey doesn't die?\n\n:[Zoom out to Cueball and his friend that now look at each other.]\n:Cueball: I don't think you quite understand.\n:Friend: I mean, ''I'm'' not '''about''' to die...\n:Cueball: From the vulture's viewpoint, everyone says that moments before they do.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Time]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]"
