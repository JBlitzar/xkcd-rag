In the original joke, a man presents a miniature piano, which is played by man of proportionate size. When asked about it, he reveals that he found a bottle with a genie inside, but the genie misunderstood his wish, and gave him a 12-inch pianist. The crux of the joke is that the word ''pianist'' sounds similar to the word ''penis''. The man considers having a larger member to be desirable (presumably due to the stereotype that it will make him more sexually appealing), but loses out on the opportunity, due to the misunderstanding. \n\nIn this comic, the opposite happens: Cueball wished for a \"twelve inch ''pianist''\" to play his miniature piano, but was misheard by the genie, implying that the genie instead granted him a \"twelve inch ''penis''.\"  Megan quickly grasps the implication, and therefore wants to have sex with Cueball (in accordance with the aforementioned stereotype; and also judging from the weird tone in \"...are you\").\n\nThe title text suggests that if Cueball had made a smaller piano – and had thus wished for a smaller ''pianist'' – he would have instead received a ''smaller penis''.\n\nGenies (or the magic lamps containing them) are mentioned in at least five other comics:\n*[[152: Hamster Ball]]\n*[[879: Lamp]] (which is also related to penises)\n*[[1391: Darkness]]\n*[[2193: Well-Ordering Principle]]\n*[[2741: Wish Interpretation]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding a box with an open lid. A miniature piano is inside. Megan is looking at it]\n:Cueball: My hobby is making miniatures. Check this out — it's a fully-functional grand piano.\n:Megan: Whoa — beautiful.\n\n:[Cueball looks at the miniature piano.]\n:Cueball: Sadly, I've never heard what proper music sounds like on it—the keys are too small to play.\n\n:[Cueball closes lid to the piano.]\n:Cueball: I once asked a genie for someone who could play it for me, but I think he misheard.\n:Megan: ...are you doing anything later?\n\n==Trivia==\nFor the record, pianist /'piənɪst/ and penis /'pinɪs/ are near homophones in English. This is because pianist has a different stress pattern than piano /pi'æno/. The vagaries of the English language.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Genie]]"
