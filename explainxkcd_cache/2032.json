This particular hobby seems to be a case of [[Nerd Sniping]], similar to that in [[559: No Pun Intended]]. [[Cueball]] knows that [[Megan]] is a word game enthusiast and - while both are probably at a party - he presents a complex sentence rather than just doing small talk. He is successful, as we can see that she is just thinking about the proper solution to that puzzle, which probably doesn't exist.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe dialog, caption, and title text contain many words that appear frequently in crossword puzzle answers because they fit well with intersecting words, in part because they have a high density of vowels. Some of the terms (parts of, start of) are also commonly used in cryptic crossword clues to indicate that nearby words should be combined or split to create an answer.\n\n{{w|Brian Eno}} is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, writer, and visual artist. He is best known for his pioneering work in ambient music and contributions to rock, pop, electronic, and generative music. He was born on 15 May 1948, and is still an active artist. But live concerts by him were rare and may not happen ever again. However, the aria was not written by himself but by his au pair who is also an opera star. And this happened after Eno ended his live career.\n\nThe title text goes further on this puzzle and asserts that {{w|Lance Ito}} was playing the aria solo on an {{w|Oboe|oboe}} at the fictive ''AirAsia Arena'' in Ohio. Ito is well known as the judge in the {{w|O. J. Simpson}} murder case.\n\nThe kind of puzzle that Megan thinks she is solving is called a \"Cryptic\" or {{w|Cryptic crossword|cryptic crossword}}, which has markedly different rules than ordinary crosswords. If Cueball's statement had been \"Part of this aria is an Indian garment\" the answer would have been \"sari\", because a part of the phrase \"this aria\" is the sequence \"sari\", which in turn is an Indian garment. Cueball's actual statement contains quite a few familiar cryptic puzzle triggers. The word \"composed\" can be a hint of a preceding or following anagram, in this case of \"this aria\" or of \"by Brian\" or of even longer adjacent strings. Although \"opera star\" could be a famous singer, say \"Caruso\", it might also be the name of an opera followed by the name of an astronomical star. \"Au pair\" could be any of its ordinary meanings, say \"nanny\", but might also be \"earrings\" (because Au is the chemical symbol for gold, and a gold pair could be earrings). The word \"start\" is often a hint to take just the beginning of a word, so \"the start\" would be \"t\", or \"start of his\" would be \"h\" or (less commonly) \"hi\". The New York Times runs a cryptic crossword as its \"second Sunday puzzle\" every other month or so, and there are other regular cryptic crossword venues. \n\nThere are various guides on the web for solving cryptics, such as this one at The Atlantic: [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/puzzclue.htm Puzzler Instructions]. Recently, information on cryptic crosswords even got its own [http://cryptics.fandom.com/wiki/Cryptipedia wiki].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan standing together.
