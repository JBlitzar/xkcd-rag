The graph in frame 3 shows an exponential rise in cancer in the 70's and 80's, followed by an exponential rise in cell phone usage in the 2000's. Black Hat reverses the correlation/causation fallacy, and comically comes to the conclusion that ''cancer'' causes ''cell phones''.\n\nThe comic highlights a well-known fallacy known as ''{{w|post hoc ergo propter hoc}}'', often shortened to simply ''post hoc.'' The Latin translates to \"after this, therefore because of this,” (the simpler \"after this\" therefore implies “because of this”; ''post hoc'', as it were!) referring to the common mistake that because two events happen in chronological order, the former event must have caused the latter event. The fallacy is often the root cause of many superstitions (e.g., a person noticing they wore a special bracelet before getting a good test score thinking the bracelet was the source of their good fortune), but it often crosses into more serious areas of thinking. In this case, the scientific research community, which often prides itself on its intellectual aptitude, is gently mocked for being nonetheless prone to such poor reasoning all too often. The different possibilities are generally known as causation, when one thing is proven to cause another, or correlation, when changes in one thing are aligned with changes in another, but there is no proof that they are directly related.\n\nThe title text refers to the way Black Hat holds the laptop in panel 2. Being that Cueball (and Randall, for that matter) are quite into computers, the potential damage to a laptop screen either from the weight of its lower body or the pressure of the user's fingers on the LCD screen is enough to make him squirm in discomfort. The risk of dropping the computer is also present. Both the fallacy and the way Black Hat is holding his laptop contribute to the \"problems\" that Cueball mentions.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball holds a cellphone. Black Hat is sitting at a desk with a laptop.]\n:Cueball: Another huge study found no evidence that cell phones cause cancer. What was the W.H.O. thinking?\n:Black Hat: I think they just got it backward.\n\n:[Black Hat turns towards Cueball in an unframed panel, holding the laptop with one hand by the upper edge of the screen. Cueball is not visible.]\n:Cueball: Huh?\n:Black Hat: Well, take a look.\n\n:[There is a plot of total cancer incidence and cell phone users. Cancer rises from 1970 to 1990, then stays relatively steady. Cell phone use rises from roughly 1984, and steeply after 1990, to the present.]\n\n:Cueball: You're not... There are ''so'' many problems with that.\n:Black Hat: Just to be safe, until I see more data I'm going to assume cancer causes cell phones.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Cancer]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]\n[[Category:Phones]]"
