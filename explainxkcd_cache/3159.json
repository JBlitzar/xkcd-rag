Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n{{w|Plate tectonics}} is the theory that the Earth's crust consists of a number of large land masses that have been slowly moving for billions of years. Continental drift was first proposed in the early 20th century, but it was controversial until the mid-1960s, until advances in technology (such as seismic imaging) made the mechanism clear.\n\nManned spaceflight officially began in 1960, when the Soviet Union launched {{w|Yuri Gagarin}} into space, after several years of launching robotic and animal payloads. Randall finds it surprising that we achieved this before we had verified something fundamental about the world we live on.  In the present day, much of plate tectonics research depends on satellite tracking and navigation, such as {{w|GPS}} (initiated 1973, launched starting in 1978, operational since 1993), to monitor plate motions in ways that a human on the ground cannot sense.  Other critical technologies include laser ranging (first invented in 1960) and pulsar tracking (first discovered in 1967), all in advancement around the same time and in the same context of the {{w|Space Race}}.\n\nThe title text points out that plate tectonics was finally validated between {{w|Neil Armstrong}}'s first and last space missions. His first flight was in 1966 on {{w|Gemini 8}}, and his last was the famous {{w|Apollo 11}}, the first mission to land on the Moon, in 1969.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n<p>[Two spacecraft, a Gemini capsule and an Agena Target Vehicle with a loose tether connecting them, are in space over the Mediterranean with Italy in the background]</p>\nSpacecraft: Houston, the view is superb. We can see the continents spread out below us, right where they've been since the earth formed.\n<p>[Caption beneath panel:]</p>\nI still can't believe we developed spaceflight before we developed spaceflight before we figured out that the continents moved.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe comic may be intended to show Gemini 8's mission, with Armstrong on board, to dock with the previously launched {{w|Agena target vehicle|target vehicle}}. However, severe control issues with that mission precluded many of the planned aims (including the experiments that involved a tethered connection). The mission that might at some point have looked most like this depiction was perhaps {{w|Gemini 11}}, also launched in 1966 but without Armstrong being on board.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>"
