[[Megan]] offers to help, but after trying to fix it, she concludes that the laptop is [[725|literally]] possessed by a malevolent spirit. In the second panel, Cueball exclaims that he has \"given up on logic.\" This could be a deliberate reference to the paranormal; ghosts are supernatural entities, and are thus immune to attempts at logical explanation.\n\nThe title text continues the conversation: when Megan tries to return the laptop to Cueball, he refuses, as Megan willingly took possession of it in the first place. Both have clearly decided that they no longer want anything to do with an object housing a supernatural entity, and are trying to pass it back to one another.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a desk with a laptop, making a fist at it.]\n:Cueball: ''Argh!''\n:Megan (off-screen): What?\n:Cueball: Why do I always have these inexplicable, impossible-to-diagnose computer problems?\n\n:[Megan walks up to the desk.]\n:Cueball: After six hours of this, I've concluded nothing works or makes sense. I give up on logic.\n:Megan: *sigh* Gimme. I'll figure it out.\n:Cueball: You won't.\n\n:[Cueball sits at his laptopless desk while Megan works on the laptop off-screen.]\n:''type type''\n:''Click''\n:Megan: ?\n:''type type type''\n:Megan: ???\n\n:[Megan is back in front of the desk, clutching the laptop.]\n:Cueball: How'd it go?\n:Megan: Your computer is literally haunted.\n:Cueball: ''Told'' you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Cueball's computer problems]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]"
