App stores take all the reviews and average the ratings for the overall star rating. \n\nIn this comic, we see why this is sometimes a bad idea, especially with something as important as an app called ''TornadoGuard'' that should alert the user if there is a {{w|tornado warning}} for an area, an announcement indicating that a tornado is approaching. In this case, there are three 5 star reviews about the stability and user interface features of the app, left by users who actually never experienced its core functionality (simply because they never used it in a place where there was a tornado since they got it); however, the only review related to whether the app really works is given the same weight as the others, and sadly for that user, the TornadoGuard app failed in alerting the user to an upcoming tornado. Tornadoes are a [[:Category:Tornadoes|recurring subject]] on xkcd. Also see the future comics [[1098: Star Ratings]] and [[1754: Tornado Safety Tips]].\n\nIn [[2615: Welcome Back]], [[Cueball]] returns to the app after almost 11 years to find that he has to walk through all kinds of info before getting to know if the visible tornado is likely to head his way...\n\nThe title text is software-developer humor, the same as used in [[583: CNR]] which contains further explanation. It is a note from the developer's {{w|Bug tracking system|bug report}}, which said they could not reproduce the error. Of course, they could only reproduce such a failure if there were a tornado coming towards their area, and if a tornado warning was issued. This is a fairly rare situation, especially in certain areas of the world. This lack of suitable testing conditions explains why the actual alert portion of their code appears to be faulty.\n\nThis is a common problem with code that cannot be easily tested -- that when finally needed, it does not actually work.  This is the reason for emergency drills.\n\nIn [[2219: Earthquake Early Warnings]] an app for warning of Earthquakes was the main topic, but tornado warnings was mentioned in the title text.\n\nIn [[2236|2236: Is it Christmas?]] being right most of the time, except when it matters was the topic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application. Next to the app title is a pictogram of a tornado touching the ground]\n\n:----App store----\n:TornadoGuard\n:From DroidCoder2187\n:-----------------\n:Plays a loud alert sound \n:when there is a tornado \n:warning for your area.\n:-----------------\n:Rating: \n:★★★★☆\n:Based on 4 reviews\n:-----------------\n:User Reviews:\n:[The first three reviews show five black stars.
