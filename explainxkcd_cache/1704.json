The humor derives from the fact that the name \"Gnome Ann\" is a {{w|Mondegreen|mondegreen}} of the phrase \"no man\". (For clarification, \"gnome\" is pronounced as in the fantastical creature and not as in the Linux-based {{w|GNOME|Gnome desktop system}}.)\n\n[[Randall]] presents the reader with six images (and a title text) captioned with quotations from a wide range of sources, each featuring an instance of the compound noun \"no man\" being replaced by \"Gnome Ann\" (and featuring a drawing that reflects this change). There is one proverb, two Biblical quotations, one literary quotation from {{w|Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes}}' ''{{w|Don Quixote}}'', one cinematic reference from the {{w|Lord of the Rings (film series)}} (the line {{w|Éowyn}} said to the {{w|Witch-king of Angmar}} before killing him), one quotation from the opening of a television show (''{{w|Star Trek: The Original Series}}''), and a quotation from a piece of historical rhetoric in the title text.\n\n===Table of quotes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| '''Modified quote'''\n| '''Original quote'''\n| '''Origin'''\n| '''Explanation'''\n|-\n| \"Time and tide wait for Gnome Ann.\"\n| \"Time and tide wait for no man.\"\n| Proverb\n| [[89: Gravitational Mass|Normally]], no one can influence time or tides. However, in this case, it would appear that Gnome Ann can stop time and tides. For the tide, it may be possible that \"{{w|No Man Is an Island|(Gnome Ann) Is an Island}}.\"\n|-\n| \"The wicked flee when Gnome Ann pursueth.\"\n| \"The wicked flee when no man pursueth.\"\n| Bible: [https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm Proverbs 28:1]\n| This biblical reference normally implies the wicked are a cowardly and/or paranoid lot, jumping at shadows and eager to flee at the mere pretense of danger or pursuit. However, in this case, it would imply that wicked people specifically run away from Gnome Ann.\n|-\n| \"What therefore God hath joined together, let Gnome Ann put asunder.\"\n| \"What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.\"\n| Bible: [https://biblehub.com/mark/10-9.htm Mark 10:9]\n| In the Bible, Jesus is asked about whether people should be allowed to divorce, and Jesus responds with this quote. It is known to appear in wedding vows, hence the fact that the man and woman in the panel are dressed for a wedding. However, in the comic, the quote becomes a command to Gnome Ann to break apart what God has joined.\n|-\n| \"Time ripens all things; Gnome Ann is born wise.\"\n| \"Time ripens all things; no man is born wise.\"\n| The novel {{w|Don Quixote}} by {{w|Miguel De Cervantes}}\n| This states that nobody is wise to begin with, and it takes time to become wise. However, it now states that Gnome Ann is wise to begin with, suggesting she is not part of the order of things within time.\n|-\n| \"Our Mission: To boldly go where Gnome Ann has gone before.\"\n| \"Our Mission: To boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\n| Intro at {{w|Star Trek: The Original Series}}\n| Originally, this was meant to emphasize that they would be exploring completely unexplored territory, which would be a potentially risky venture. However, in this case, it means that they will be following Gnome Ann, which is not exploration. Though depending on where Gnome Ann has gone, these may still be risky ventures: \"{{w|Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|(Gnome Ann) goes to battle to be killed}}.\"\n|-\n| \"Fool! No man can kill me.\"\n\"I am Gnome Ann!\"\n| \"Fool! No man can kill me.\"\n\"I am no man!\"\n| {{w|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\n| The Witch-king of Angmar was given a prophecy that he would never be bested in combat by the hand of man, and he boasted \"no man\" could kill him. Both in ''Lord of the Rings'' and this comic, he is defeated by a woman (in this case, Éowyn). Gnome Ann is simply that good. Note that in the Tolkien legendarium, a \"Gnome\" is an archaic name for the Noldor tribe of elves (e.g., Galadriel).\n|-\n| \"If I am to be shot at, I want Gnome Ann to be in the way of the bullet.\"\n| \"If I am to be shot at, I want no man to be in the way of the bullet.\"\n| {{w|Andrew Johnson}}, 17th President of the United States\n| '''Title text''': The intent of this statement originally was that Andrew Johnson would rather be killed than have somebody else be killed trying to save his life. However, in this case, it would appear that Andrew Johnson would prefer Gnome Ann to be shot instead of himself, perhaps because he knows that \"{{w|Algernon Charles Swinburne|(Gnome Ann) lives forever}}.\"\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:The <big>Legend</big> of <big>Gnome Ann</big>\n\n:[At the beach, between a clock hanging in the air, showing 10 past 10 and the shoreline, Gnome Ann, a woman with curly hair and a black triangular hat, stands with her arms outstretched towards the clock and the sea. For each of the first five panels, a text is written within a frame above the drawings.]\n:Time and tide wait for Gnome Ann.\n\n:[Gnome Ann, running in from the left frame with her arms out, chases three Cueball-like men running from her towards the right. The one closest to her looks over his shoulder at her, the next runs forward \"normally,\" and the last in front throws up his arms in the air.]\n:The wicked flee when Gnome Ann pursueth.\n:-<small>Proverbs 28:1</small>\n\n:[Gnome Ann takes the groom's place in a wedding, shoving him to the side. The groom, Hairy with a bow tie, falls while throwing his arms out. The bride stands to the left, in full wedding dress, showing no reaction.]\n:What therefore God hath joined together, let Gnome Ann put asunder.\n:-<small>Mark 10:9</small>\n\n:[Gnome Ann sits in a yoga position meditating on a big rock in a desolate area with small stones on the ground around the big rock.]\n:Time ripens all things; Gnome Ann is born wise.\n:-<small>Miguel De Cervantes</small>\n\n:[The starship Enterprise from Star Trek is seen from behind as it flies to the right, chasing a smaller craft. In this panel, the frame with text is shown to emanate from Enterprise with a zig-zag arrow pointing to the starship.]\n:Enterprise: Our Mission: To boldly go where Gnome Ann has gone before.\n\n:[The Witch-king of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl, from ''The Lord of the Rings'' sits on his knees (below the frame) to the left of Gnome Ann, who is preparing to stab him with a sword pointing at his head. She is also holding her other arm out towards him. The Witch-king has a black cloak covering his head and body, adorned with a kind of crown featuring six small spikes around his head and one large spike in front. It also falls over each side of his head, showing a gaping hole instead of a face. In this panel, the text is spoken by the two characters.]\n:Witch-king: Fool! No man can kill me.\n:Gnome Ann: '''''I Am Gnome Ann!'''''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Time]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Star Trek]]\n[[Category:LOTR]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Wedding]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring politicians]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
