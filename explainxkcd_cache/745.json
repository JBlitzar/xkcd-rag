In this case, the dyslexics were trying to make a parody of their propensity to transpose letters. The double transposition cancelled out, resulting in the original (but unintended) untransposed message.\n\nThe title text is an inversion of the inversion of the joke in the comic, in which [[Randall]] accidentally wrote the \"incorrect\" version of the shirt while trying to draw the comic. The last sentence (\"I kept doing 'doing 'doing it wrong' wrong' wrong\") means that, unwittingly, Randall kept failing at failing at failing.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A t-shirt is shown with the text \"DYSLEXICS OF THE WORLD, '''UNITE!'''\" screen-printed on it.]\n:The dyslexic support group ran into difficulties when they tried to make a joke fundraiser t-shirt.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Language]]"
