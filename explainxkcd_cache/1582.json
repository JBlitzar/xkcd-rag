Picture another field. In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn this comic [[Megan]] asks [[Cueball]] to picture himself in a grassy field. It is a standard technique to begin a visualization by asking the person to imagine that they are in some calm environment (could be for any kind of {{w|meditation}}/{{w|mindfulness}} like for instance {{w|yoga}}). A [https://www.google.com/search?q=imagine+grassy+field&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 grassy field] could have been replaced by a [https://www.google.com/search?q=imagine+you+are+on+a+beach&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 beach] at the sea, or a [https://www.google.com/search?q=imagine+you+are+in+a+forest&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 forest] with sunbeams coming down through the trees.\n\nProceeding with the visualization Megan asks Cueball to imagine a creature with the power to be able to escape from any visualized scene, and then tries to convince him that this creature has indeed escaped from his current visualization as it indeed would be able to do. She then proceeds by apologizing for this but then tells him (warns him) that it from now on might appear in Cueball's daydreams, so he should begin looking out for it. This indicates that she is not at all sorry, but did this intentionally to try and mess with Cueball's head. The idea of the possibility of escaping an imagined situation was already used in [[248: Hypotheticals]]. Now that Megan has introduced both the idea of the creature and the idea that it may appear in his daydreams, Cueball will almost certainly think of it from time to time, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIn the title text Megan proposes a solution to get rid of the creature in Cueball's daydream, namely by picturing the only creature that the first fears. However, if this new (maybe quite scary) creature should be able to pursue the original creature, then it would also have to be able to move through visualized scenes just as easily. And this is what Megan pretends happens again. So now the problem is that Cueball has two creatures on the loose in his daydreams. And even if the second scares the first away, he would then still have the new one to worry about.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are walking together.]\n\n:Megan: Picture a grassy field.\n:Megan: In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it.\n:Megan: It glances around nervously and-\n:Megan: -whoops, where'd it go?\n:Megan: Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]"
