Beamsplitters are used in numerous scientific instruments such as microscopes and (here) telescopes. In a microscope, for example, a beamsplitter may be used to direct the imaging beam to the user's eyes, or to a recording device such as a camera, or to both at once so as to allow visual aiming at specific targets at the same time as conducting scientific measurements upon them. Beam-splitting in order to simultaneously analyse a single 'ray' of light with two or more different types of detectors is also scientifically useful.\n\nIn this comic, a beamsplitter is being used in a large-scale telescope to \"steal\" part of the incident light beam and direct it to a {{w|Solar cell|photovoltaic cell}}. The power generated is then sold on the local grid. The scientists could be {{w|Embezzlement|pocketing the proceeds}}, or possibly using them to help pay the telescope operation's bills. This could be dark humor, implying that surreptitious and legally/ethically questionable strategies are needed to fund scientists and their projects. The comic pushes the point by supposing that the practice had become so commonplace that the {{w|International Astronomical Union}} (IAU) got wind of it, and has acted to ban it.\n\nMost optical instruments, even large telescopes, are unlikely to capture enough light during regular operations to make the \"banned\" strategy feasible. (Far more light would reach the solar cell if it was simply left outdoors, even on a cloudy day.)  Moreover, the ban is ham-fisted, as it makes legitimate scientific operation of telescopes profoundly more difficult. For the sake of the joke, both of these issues are ignored.\n\nThe telescope shown, without the beam splitter, is a reflecting telescope of the general form of a {{w|Gregorian telescope}}, or a derivative, while the sending of (a fraction of) the light out the side is implemented in the manner of a {{w|Nasmyth telescope}}.\n\nThe title text humorously conflates financial tax laws, applicable to the sale of the {{w|Abstracting electricity|\"stolen\" electricity}}, with the laws of quantum physics, governing the behavior of the photons that are generating the electricity. Under typical {{w|Capital_gain|capital gains}} tax laws, certain intangible assets such as stocks are not taxed until they are sold, at which point taxes will be levied on the profits of the sale (relative to the asset's purchase price). This is typically done to simplify tax assessment, as it can be very difficult to assign a concrete value (and thus tax burden) to certain assets until they are sold and the value realized. It is also typically done for reasons of liquidity; a taxpayer may have insufficient cash to pay a tax until they have sold the underlying assets.\n\nThe title text imagines a fictional \"quantum tax law\" in which individual photons are treated as taxable assets. Due to the probabilistic nature of the photon's {{w|Wave_function|wave function}}, the monetary value of any given photon entering the telescope is uncertain up until the point where it strikes the photovoltaic cell, generating an electron which is sold to the power grid. Under the quantum tax law, the \"wavefunction\" of the photon refers not to its traditional quantum {{w|Wave_function|wave function}}, but to the monetary wavefunction which can only be observed once the photon has generated a tangible profit. This is likely an analogy with {{w|capital gains tax}} which does not accrue until assets are sold at a profit over their purchase price.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Do NOT delete this tag too soon.}}\n\n:[Cross section of a telescope with some parts of the image darkened to represent the path of light, with portions where the light would be more concentrated being darker]\n\n:[Labels with arrows as they appear left to right, top to bottom:]\n:Incoming Light\n:Primary Mirror\n:Secondary Mirror\n:Beamsplitter\n:Sensor\n:Secret Solar Panel\n:Power Sold To Grid\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Astronomy News: The International Astronomical Union has finally banned beamsplitters, optical devices used by scientists to embezzle light from their instruments.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Telescopes]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Taxes]]"
