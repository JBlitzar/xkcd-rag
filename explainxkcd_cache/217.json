[[Black Hat]] explains how he tricked a programming team into believing that e<sup>π</sup> − π really equals 20 — instead of just being weirdly close — thus that any noticeable deviation from 20 results from errors in the code. This made them waste a lot of time trying to find a nonexistent bug until they realized that Black Hat was lying (clearly they had not known him for very long, and clearly they weren't very knowledgeable in mathematics).\n\n{{w|Floating point}} numbers are how computers store non-integer real numbers as decimals — or rather, in most cases, approximate them: infinite amounts of data would be required to represent most numbers in decimal form (exceptions are {{w|integers}} and {{w|terminating decimal}}s). The \"floating-point handlers\" would be the code performing the e<sup>π</sup> − π calculation.\n\nACM is the {{w|Association for Computing Machinery}}, which at the time of writing sponsored the {{w|ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest|International Collegiate Programming Contest}}. It is likely that it was this competition, in which Black Hat wasted his team's time, for which he got kicked out.\n\nThe title text pokes fun at another coincidence: ∜(9² + 19²/22) ≈ 3.1415926525, equating close to π (deviating only from the 9th decimal place). The humor comes from the fact that π is {{w|transcendental number|transcendental}}. Transcendental numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed through basic arithmetic with integers; one cannot end up with the exact value for any transcendental number (including π) by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, exponentiating, and/or taking the nth root of any rational number, meaning the title text cannot possibly be true. This coincidence was discovered by Ramanujan while {{w|squaring the circle}} in 1914.\n\nA much later comic, [[1047: Approximations]], puts forth quite a few more mathematical coincidences, and [[3023: The Maritime Approximation]] does similarly for measurement units.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Hey, check it out: e<sup>π</sup> − π is 19.999099979. That's weird.\n:Black Hat: Yeah. That's how I got kicked out of the ACM in college.\n:Cueball: ...what?\n:Black Hat: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that e<sup>π</sup> − π was a standard test of floating-point handlers -- it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors.\n:Cueball: That's awful.\n:Black Hat: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out.\n\n==Trivia==\n* e<sup>π</sup> − π is an {{w|irrational number}}. It was proven by {{w|Yuri Valentinovich Nesterenko}} in the late 20th century.\n* At the time when this comic was published, the mysterious almost-equation e<sup>π</sup> − π ≈ 20 was believed to be a {{w|mathematical coincidence}}, or a numerical relationship that \"just happens\" with no satisfactory explanation. In September 2023, an explanation was found based on the {{w|Theta_function#Jacobi_identities|Jacobi identities}}.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Programming]]"
