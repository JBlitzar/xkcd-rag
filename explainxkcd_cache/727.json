Now, it's possible you're simply embedding Windows directory paths in your URIs, but in that case you need more than just a short lecture.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] explains to the [[:Category:News anchor|news anchor]] that the {{w|Slash (punctuation)|slash character}} (/), also known as forward slash, is the correct way to separate distinct parts of a web address; for example in the address [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation) <code>https:'''//'''en.wikipedia.org'''/'''wiki'''/'''Slash_(punctuation)</code>], a slash follows the words \"org\" and \"wiki\". However, some newscasters are unfamiliar with the distinction between the different types of slashes, thus confusing the normal slash with the {{w|backslash}} (\\), the wrong character. They may also be somewhat overzealous by trying to specify forward- or backslash since just saying \"slash\" would be sufficient. Also as mentioned in the title text the backslash is used in addresses on a Windows PC. Slashes and backslashes in URLs would also be mentioned in the title text of [[3113: Fix This Sign]].\n\nSteven Berlee claims that he suffers every time this mistake is made in a news program, explaining his reason for cheating his way on the air. Steven's name is most likely made up, as it seems to be taken from two or three of the inventors of the {{w|Internet}}:\n\n*Dr. {{w|Steve Crocker}} who has worked in the Internet community since its inception. He was part of the team that developed the protocols for the {{w|ARPANET}} which were the foundation for today's Internet and for this work, he was awarded the 2002 IEEE Internet Award. His real name is Stephen D. Crocker.\n\n*Dr. {{w|Stephen Wolff}}, spelled differently than Steve, but the same as the real name of Steve Crocker. He is one of the many fathers of the Internet, mainly credited with turning the Internet from a government project into something that proved to have scholarly and commercial interest for the rest of the world. At one point he managed a research group that participated in the development of ARPANET.\n\n*Sir {{w|Tim Berners-Lee}}'s last name can made into the {{w|portmanteau}} ''Berlee''. He is an English computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, which oversees the continued development of the Web.\nSearching the internet lists no one called Steven Berlee, and the only references point back to this comic.\n\nThe title text refers to how in the {{w|Windows}} operating system, the backslash is actually used instead of the slash as a separator (in contrast to Unix-based systems, which use the forward slash). Thus, the path to any Windows file encoded in a {{w|Uniform resource identifier|URI}} (Uniform Resource Identifier &mdash; which may sometimes also be a called a {{w|URL|Uniform Resource Locator}}) would correctly contain the backslash character. It is possible to pass parameters, including strings, in an internet URI and so you could have an identifier that directly embedded the path of a Windows file on a Windows server - this would be such a weird and terrible thing to do.{{Actual citation needed}} \n\nIn the title text Steven complains that after having had the modern version of the Internet for 20 years (since early 1990s, with this comic was released in 2010), they should have learned the difference by now. He also continues to claim that if they do not understand the difference between an internet URI and Windows directory paths, and thus are embedding these into their URIs, then he cannot help them with just a short lecture as they need more extensive re-education.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball as a news anchor is sitting behind a desk with his hand on the desk, leaning towards his off-panel guest to the right.]\n:Cueball: And for more on the summit, we turn to trade expert Dr. Steven Berlee. \n:Cueball: Steven?\n\n:[Zoom out to include Dr. Steven Berlee, also drawn like Cueball, with his hands below he desk, sitting behind the desk to the right of Cueball facing towards him, still with his hands on the desk.]\n:Steven Berlee: I'm not actually a doctor or a trade expert. I'm just a programmer who lies to get on news shows.\n\n:[Close-up on Steven Berlee.]\n:Cueball (off-panel): What? Why?\n:Steven Berlee: To share a message with newscasters.\n\n:[Zoom back out to show both men, the news anchor now also with his hands below the desk.]\n:Cueball: Which is?\n:Steven Berlee: Every time you say \"backslash\" as part of a web address on air, I die a little.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:News anchor]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
