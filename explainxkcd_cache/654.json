You have only yourself to blame.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Megan]] and [[Ponytail]] are playing together on an online multiplayer shooter game. Ponytail calls [[Cueball]], who is living with Megan, and easily persuades him to make {{w|nachos}}. {{w|Wi-Fi}} and {{w|microwave oven}}s both use {{w|ISM band|radio frequencies around 2.4 GHz}}, so Cueball's cooking disrupts Megan's connection and allows Ponytail to kill Megan's character. [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/boom-headshot Boom! Headshot] is a catchphrase made popular through a web mockumentary series called ''Pure Pwnage'', and is also used in the game League of Legends by the character Caitlyn.\n\nThe title text points out that Megan has only herself to blame, as gaming on WiFi is susceptible to such issues, while gaming with a wired connection (e.g. {{w|Ethernet}}) is not.\n\nNote: If using the microwave actually does interfere with your WiFi, then get another microwave. Not (strictly) because it would mess with the WiFi, but because your microwave has a hole somewhere and is leaking non-ionizing radiation it shouldn't. It won't kill you, but it's not operating at peak efficiency. See this [https://youtu.be/ot4_jVFXxUU video] on the subject.\n\nAround the time of this comic's release, the xkcd website was temporarily redesigned using {{w|Yahoo! GeoCities}}. Snapshots of the site at the time can be found on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027014324/http://xkcd.com/ Internet Archive Wayback Machine].\n\nThis was the fifth time Megan is drawn and given the [[Megan#Name|name Megan]] in xkcd, the first time being in [[159: Boombox]]. Once in between this and the previous of these comics ([[478: The Staple Madness]]), her name was used in [[596: Latitude]], but she was [[596:_Latitude#Trivia|not drawn]] there.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is on the phone with Ponytail, who's on her computer in the other half of a split panel.]\n:Cueball: Hello? ... Oh, hey. Looking for Megan? She's gaming.\n:Ponytail: I know. You know what's delicious? Nachos.\n\n:[Ponytail clicks on her computer while talking.]\n:Ponytail: When you layer the cheese so it gets on every chip... then smother them in sour cream and salsa...\n\n:Cueball: Mm, that IS delicious. And I've got the ingredients, too!\n:Ponytail, on phone: You should make some!\n:Cueball: I will!\n:Ponytail, on phone: Hurry.\n\n:[Cueball is making nachos in the microwave.]\n:Microwave: ''beep beep whirrrr''\n\n:Megan, at her computer: My wifi signal!\n\n:[Ponytail who called is at her computer.]\n:Computer: Boom!
