How funny !! Sport !! Reason\n|-\n|rowspan=5| Not that funny || {{w|Rowing}} - One or more people row a boat to a destination.|| The person would struggle to row effectively, falling out of cadence and fouling the oars of the other rowers in their boat. However, if Randall competed in the single sculls, such coordination would not be an issue, and he would likely just be much slower than the other competitors. Or fall in the water.\n|-\n| {{w|Fencing}} - Two contestants attempt to land hits on each other with a long fencing weapon.|| Contrary to what is often portrayed in movies, sword fights of any kind are very quick, often lasting just a few seconds. Olympic fencing matches are especially fast, and an untrained layman watching the fight would probably be unable to tell the difference between a fight between two experts and a fight in which one person had no experience, aside from that said person would lose every bout.\n|-\n| {{w|Weightlifting}} - Contestants lift weights, which, in the Olympics, get heavier with each round, until all but one fail to lift.|| They might just fail to lift the weights or injure their back.\n|-\n| {{w|Golf}} - Contestants attempt to use golf clubs to hit a golf ball into one or more holes in as small a number of hits as possible.|| The worst case scenario would be simply failing to hit the ball. If he did make contact, the ball would likely fail to go in the right direction and/or fail to achieve the right distance. \n----\n''The comic illustrates this by having Randall putt and miss the hole at very close range.''\n|-\n| {{w|Archery}} - Using a bow and arrow, contestants attempt to hit a target with as much accuracy as possible.|| Arrows might miss the target, but this wouldn't be particularly amusing (unless Randall forgoes armbraces & discovers the bowstring's propensity for smacking the inside of his wrist after releasing it).\n----\n''The comic shows Randall missing all his shots on the target.''\n|-\n|rowspan=5| Pretty funny || {{w|Swimming}} - Contestants swim to a destination or complete lengths as fast as possible.|| They might struggle to stay afloat (particularly in open water swimming, where they would be buffeted by other contestants) or {{w|Eric Moussambani|swim awkwardly}}. They are also likely to have a markedly different physique to the other competitors, which would have a comic effect.\n|-\n| {{w|Long jump}} - Contestants, with a running start, attempt to jump as far as possible.|| They would likely make a very short jump, or perhaps foul every jump, and possibly trip and land in the pit.\n|-\n| {{w|Pole vault}} - Using a bendable pole, contestants attempt to propel (vault) themselves over a bar.|| An untrained person attempting to pole vault would very likely miss the plant altogether, and simply run headlong into the bar. Even if he managed to plant the pole, attempting to hold onto it would likely result in him being knocked off his feet.\n|-\n| {{w|Diving}} - Contestants attempt to fulfil multiple criteria while diving into water.|| Awkward or painful-looking dives could ensue. Potential for injury would be high.\n|-\n| {{w|Hurdles}} - Contestants run on a track with hurdles positioned at various places.|| They might trip and fall over the hurdles, just knock them all over as they fail to clear them, or [https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184329986/belgian-shot-putter-runs-hurdles-belgium carefully step over each hurdle].\n----\n''Drawn in this section, Randall repeatedly and unpleasantly runs into the hurdles, unable to jump over any of them. He has his arm raised bent in front of his face in a classic hurdler's pose, but appears to have failed to get much, if any, height off the ground.''\n|-\n|rowspan=5| Incredibly funny || {{w|Figure skating}} [The only Winter Olympic discipline featured in the main comic] Competitors perform artistic routines set to music while skating on an ice rink, and are judged on a combination of skating skill, composition, and presentation. || They might slip and fall continually on the ice, with a high risk for sprained joints or bone fractures. This might have particular comic potential if Randall were skating as part of a pair, awkwardly attempting to lift and spin a partner, or perhaps doing nothing but being lifted and dragged around by them.\n|-\n| {{w|Horizontal bar}} - A horizontal bar is used to perform gymnastics.|| An untrained person would likely struggle to even hold onto the bar, and would likely be able to do no more than swing back and forth until they lost their grip. \n|-\n| {{w|Equestrian sports}} - Various activities involving the use of horses.|| Attempting any jumps or tricks without training would likely result in failure to control the horse, and most likely end with the riding falling off or being thrown off. \n----\n''Randall is shown completely unable to control his horse. He is in the process of falling off and is flailing his arms.\n|-\n| {{w|Freestyle BMX}} - Contestants ride BMX bikes and perform various tricks, and are then judged by trick quality.|| He would likely fail to perform even basic tricks, and any attempts to do so would result in one or more crashes. \n|-\n| {{w|Pommel horse}} - Using a gymnastic device somewhat similar to a horse, gymnasts perform various tricks.|| They might awkwardly flop around, fall off, or lose their balance & risk crushing {{tvtropes|GroinAttack|a particularly squashy part}} of their anatomy, which could, depending on one's sense of humor, the context, & the exact aesthetics of the incident, elicit laughter.\n----\n''Randall is depicted awkwardly perched atop a pommel horse with a leg extended.\n|}\n\nThe title text may be a reference to ski jumper {{w|Vinko Bogataj}}, whose spectacular crash at a (non-Olympic) {{w|Ski_flying|ski flying}} event in 1970 in Oberstdorf, (then) West Germany became emblematic of the expression \"the agony of defeat\" in the opening narration of the popular US television program \"{{w|Wide World of Sports (American TV program)|Wide World of Sports}}\". Alternatively the reference may be to {{w|Eddie the Eagle}}, whose poor performance in the {{w|Ski_jumping|ski jump}} at the {{w|1988 Winter Olympics}} led to the introduction of a rule requiring entrants to be ranked internationally in the top 50 and top 30%.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A header is above three panels, with each panel containing a title at the top of how funny it would be, a bullet list of five sports, and one or two depictions of Cueball performing sports from that list.]\n:Header: Olympic Sports ranked by how funny it would be if I, a regular person without athletic training, snuck onto the team to compete:\n\n:[The first panel:]\n:Title:  <u>Not that funny</u>\n:*Rowing\n:*Fencing\n:*Weightlifting\n:*Golf\n:*Archery\n:[This panel shows Cueball putting a ball with a golf club and missing the hole from a close distance, and Cueball aiming a bow while three arrows are on the ground at various distances from the target.]\n\n:[The second panel:]\n:Title:  <u>Pretty funny</u>\n:*Swimming\n:*Long jump\n:*Pole vault\n:*Diving\n:*Hurdles\n:[This panel shows Cueball running stomach-first into a hurdle, while holding an arm in front of his head.
