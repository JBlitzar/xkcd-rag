The table begins by listing properties pertinent to {{w|particle physics}} as the title suggests, but quickly devolves to other domains such as role-playing games (such as D&D) and sports after failing to provide a good definition of {{w|Flavour (particle physics)|flavor}}.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! Property\n! Scale\n! Explanation\n|-\n| Electric charge\n| [-1,1]\n| The {{w|electric charge}} is shown in increments of a third from -1 to +1 which are the only known charges of fundamental particles (leptons, quarks and gauge bosons); however there are some exotic composite particles with twice integer charge, e.g. the recently discovered {{w|Ξcc++|double charmed Xi baryon}} with a charge of +2.\n\nQuarks are the only particles with charges of ± ⅓ or ± ⅔, but cannot exist individually; below the {{w|Hagedorn temperature}}, they are only found within hadrons. To date, all hadrons (particles composed of quarks), leptons, and bosons have integer charge, and current models indicate that this must be the case.\n|-\n| Mass\n| [0,∞) in kg\n| Mass (specifically {{w|rest mass}}) is the measure of an object or particle's resistance to force, as well as its ability to distort {{w|spacetime}} (its gravitational attraction).\nTheoretically, any object's mass could approach infinity, but mass cannot be below 0 (as far as {{w|Negative mass|we know}}). The mass units shown (kilograms) are, however, far too large for particles. Some particles, such as photons, have zero rest mass and are therefore massless.\n\nAll particles with rest mass obtain it through confinement, either by the {{w|Higgs field}} (the quarks; leptons; and W, Z, and Higgs bosons) or the strong nuclear force (hadrons).\nParticles with no rest mass (photons and gluons) can only move at lightspeed.\n|-\n| Spin number\n| (–∞,∞) (Intervals of ½)\n| {{w|Spin (physics)|Spin}} is a {{w|quantum number}} describing subatomic particles, named for the vaguely analogous but crucially distinct concept of {{w|angular momentum}} in classical physics. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYeRS5a3HbE&ab_channel=ScienceClicEnglish Quantum mechanical spin is ''not'' rotation, but rather how quickly the particle changes state when rotated.]\n\nHalf-integer spin particles are classified as {{w|fermions}} and whole integer spin particles are {{w|bosons}}. Two fermions cannot have exactly the same state, an observation known as the {{w|Pauli exclusion principle}}. Thus, for fermions to exist in the same position, they must have opposite spins, of +½ and –½. It follows that a maximum of two fermions of the same flavor (e.g. two electrons) may exist in the same position.\n|-\n| Flavor\n| Misc. quantum numbers\n| Flavor is a series of {{w|quantum numbers}} that do not fit neatly onto a set of dimensional axes. \n\nThe most general theory breaks flavor down into four distinct conserved values, the electric charge, the weak isospin, the baryon number and the lepton number, but more specific models increase the number of distinct values. Quarks, for example, add five more flavor numbers: isospin (upness vs. downness), strangeness, charm, topness and bottomness (the last four are literally just the number of strange, charmed, top and bottom quarks, minus the corresponding anti-quarks). \n|-\n| Color charge\n| Coordinate system with R, G and B axes\n| The primary {{w|strong nuclear force}} has six mutually attractive charges, arranged in three perpendicular axes each analogous to electric charge. These charges are commonly referred to as \"{{w|Color charge|color}}\" and the three axes are given the names of the three primary colors of light: Red, Green and Blue. The black dots in the diagram represent the actual colors while the white dots are the anti-color charges: anti-Red (colored cyan in diagrams), anti-Green (magenta) and anti-Blue (yellow). To complete the analogy, a color charge of zero is referred to as \"White\". The names of these charges are purely allegorical, but they do make it convenient to refer to them, especially in diagrams.\n\nThe color of a particle not confined by the strong force must be White, either as the sum of a color and its anti-color (as in a meson), as the sum of RGB or anti-RGB (as in a baryon), or as a sum of those sums (As in tetra-, penta- or hexaquarks). The attraction of the strong nuclear force is so strong that attempting to separate two quarks from each other creates enough energy to create two new quarks, which then bind to the original quarks. This property is known as \"confinement\" and means that color charge can never be observed directly.\n\nRandall is incorrect in stating \"Quarks only\", since {{w|gluon}}s (the particle that carries the color force) are themselves colored. However, the colors of gluons are much more complicated, with a total of eight distinct superpositions of every possible color-anticolor pair. The fact that gluons are subject to the force they mediate also means that the strong force has a defined radius of effect, unlike the electromagnetic force, whose gauge bosons (the photon) are uncharged.\n|-\n| Mood\n| 5 emojis on a number line ranging from angry to joyful\n| Particles are not considered to have mood, even in the allegorical way they have color or flavor, but Randall implies that there is a quantized 5 point scale (from \"angry\" to \"ecstatic\") which would have some effect on the properties of the particle. This would be more appropriate for measuring customer satisfaction. Charts such as this are also sometimes used in medicine to indicate levels of pain, and in some psychiatric treatments as a quick way to track changes in the patient's condition.\n\nIn grammar, {{w|Grammatical particles|particles}} are a nebulous class of words, usually defined by a lack of declension or conjugation (such as prepositions in English). Some languages use particles instead of or in addition to \"standard\" declension/conjugation, much like auxiliary verbs are used in English. These particles may well carry \"{{w|Grammatical mood|mood}}\" as an attribute, as well as tense and aspect.\n|-\n| Alignment\n| 3x3 grid with varying shades (columns Good-Evil, rows Lawful-Chaotic)\n| A reference to the tabletop RPG ''{{w|Dungeons & Dragons}}'', where characters have an {{w|Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment}} that is either Good, Neutral, or Evil (describing whether they have a propensity to help or harm others) and either Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (describing how much they care about organizations, social norms, and the status quo). Common examples of these alignments include Darth Vader (Lawful Evil), Superman (Lawful Good), Robin Hood (Chaotic Good), and the Joker (Chaotic Evil). This may be a reference to the now defunct names of the two heaviest known quarks (\"truth\" and \"beauty\").\n|-\n| Hit points\n| [0,∞)\n| Games (videogames, board games, CCGs, RPGs, etc.) often have values for players and other entities that represent {{w|Health (video game)|health}} (also called hit points or HP). Generally there is not necessarily a limit on this value, but it does not often go below 0 as the zero value is considered \"dead\" (or some equivalent).\n|-\n| Rating\n| 5-star scale\n| The five-star rating system is often used to rate films, TV shows, restaurants, and hotels. Randall has previously criticized this system in [[937: TornadoGuard]] and [[1098: Star Ratings]].\n\nInterestingly, unlike the \"Heat\" rating with the chili peppers below, this scale doesn't have a creatively labeled number line, merely a rating (3.5, in this case). Considering [[1098]], could Randall be subtly self-deprecating here?\n|-\n| String type\n| Bytestring-Charstring\n| In computer science, this denotes what type of data is stored subsequent set of elements or a {{w|String_(computing)|string}}. This is likely a pun on {{w|String_(physics)|string}} types that appear in {{w|string theory}} and particle physics, and may also be a reference to {{w|Python (programming language)|Python}}, in which the difference between a byte string and a (Unicode) character string is a cause of difficulties for some programmers.\n|-\n| Batting average\n| [0,100] in %\n| In {{w|baseball}}, a player's {{w|batting average}} is calculated by dividing their hits by their at-bats. Instead of using the percent sign (%), it is usually presented as a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) expressed as three decimal places with no leading zero: [.000, 1.000]. It is pronounced as though it is multiplied by 1,000: A batter with a batting average of .342 (which is very good) is said to be \"batting three forty-two.\" A perfect batting average (unattainable except in very small samples) gives rise to the expression \"batting a thousand.\" The 0-100 scale would be a better match for the batting average statistic in {{w|cricket}}, although percents would still not be used.\n|-\n| Proof\n| [0,200]\n| This refers to {{w|alcohol proof}}, which is the measure of the amount of ethanol in a beverage by volume. In the United States, 100 proof correspond to 50% alcohol, so the proof of a beverage is two times the percentage of ethanol, so the maximum value is at most 200.\n|-\n| Heat\n| No jalapeño icons - 3 jalapeño icons, increasing\n| Spicy dishes are sometimes measured by the intensity of the spicy flavor, usually ranging from values like \"mild\" to \"hot\". The gray jalapeño likely represents negligible or no spicy taste in the food. However, as an objective scale it is largely meaningless, since there is no reliable consistency in how these ratings are applied - what may be considered a 3-chilli dish in one establishment may only be a 1-chilli dish in another (as restaurants rarely if ever intend their dishes to be rated on the {{w|Scoville scale}}). The scale being unlimited may be a reference to the practice of some restaurants where a fourth or fifth chilli may be added to exaggerate the heat of their dishes.\n\nThis measure of heat is unrelated to the particle's {{w|Thermodynamics|thermodynamic}} momentum.\n|-\n| Street value\n| [0,∞) in $\n| The value of a good or service (particles are usually not services) in non-retail, non-wholesale transactions between individuals.\n|-\n| Entropy\n| ''This already has like 20 different confusing meanings, so it probably means something here, too.''\n| The term \"entropy\", which {{w|History of entropy|began}} as a {{w|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|thermodynamic measure}}, has since been adopted {{w|Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory|by analogy}} into {{w|Entropy (disambiguation)|multiple seemingly unrelated domains}} including, for example, information theory. The table allows that the term \"entropy\" must mean something in the context of particle physics, but isn't certain whether it's the classical, Gibbs' modern {{w|Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|statistical mechanics}}, Von Neumann's {{w|Von Neumann entropy|quantum entropy}}, or some other meaning. \n\nIn classical thermodynamics, entropy is a macroscopic property describing the disorder or randomness of a system with many particles. However, in statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, the concept of entropy can also be applied to single particles under certain conditions. If the particle's position is not precisely known and can be described by a probability distribution, this contributes to entropy. Similarly, if the particle's momentum is uncertain and described probabilistically, this also contributes to entropy. A single quantum particle in a pure state (e.g., an electron in a specific atomic orbital) has zero entropy. This is because there is no uncertainty about the state of the system. If the single particle's state is described by a density matrix representing a mixed state (a probabilistic mixture of several possible states), the Von Neumann entropy can quantify the degree of uncertainty or mixedness of the state.\n\nImagine two identical balloons filled with the same gas and heated from two opposite sides with identical heat sources, creating symmetric temperature gradients in both; because the distribution of temperatures is the same, the Gibbs statistical thermodynamic entropy 𝑆 of the gas molecule particles in each balloon will be the same. In contrast, if one balloon is heated by a low-power heat source and another by an otherwise identical high-power heat source, the balloon next to the high-power heat source will have a steeper temperature gradient, increasing the number of [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/accessible-microstates accessible] {{w|Microstate|microstates}}, so the Gibbs entropy 𝑆<sub>low power</sub> < 𝑆<sub>high power</sub>. Now consider electrons in two atoms excited by absorbing identical photons to a mixed state; if the mixed states have the same probabilities for different energy levels, their Von Neumann quantum entropy 𝑆 values will be the same. Conversely, if one atom has electrons excited to a {{w|Purity_(quantum_mechanics)|pure state}} and another to a mixed state by photons of different energies, the mixed state will have higher entropy due to greater uncertainty, i.e., 𝑆<sub>pure</sub> = 0 and 0 < 𝑆<sub>mixed</sub> ≤ ln(2).\n\nPlease see also [[2318: Dynamic Entropy]].\n|}\n\nThe title text says that in addition each particle has a password, but only hash of the password can be observed. This is a computer science reference. In computer science, properties (e.g. of an object or program) often can be changed with a single command. In physics as we observe it, properties can locally change with the environment. There are several {{w|Time-variation_of_fundamental_constants|experiments}}, whether physical constants are really time-const. Password hashing is the practice of hiding the password itself by storing only an irreversible representation of the password. Since the password itself is not stored, the password cannot ever be viewed by the user or a hacker (outside of the login page). This method is considered to be safest way of storing passwords. Password hashing using some {{w|key derivation function}} makes it impossible to steal passwords even if the server that stores hashes is cracked, unless the hash function is also broken, which should be a task which cannot be completed in any feasible time for sufficiently strong passwords. The title-text claims this is predicted by the {{w|cosmic censorship hypothesis}}, which in reality claims that a {{w|gravitational singularity}} must always be obscured by an event horizon (i.e.: there can't be a {{w|naked singularity}}). There is also a hint of quantum mechanics in the statement, as observation is one of the central concepts of the field, and {{w|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle}} actually states that it is impossible to observe (measure) some property of a particle with arbitrary precision when another one is known (e.g.: you can't determine the momentum and position of a particle). This makes the title text a mix of several domains, as was the above table.\n\n==Transcript==\n:<big>Particle Properties in Physics</big>\n{| class=wikitable\n! Property\n!
