Wish #2 was for him to lose the ability to remember that each new wish wasn't my first.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is one of five other comics related to genies.\n*[[152: Hamster Ball]]\n*[[879: Lamp]]\n*[[532: Piano]]\n*[[2193: Well-Ordering Principle]]\n*[[2741: Wish Interpretation]]\n\n\n[[Ponytail]] as a [[:Category:News anchor|news anchor]] describes the sunset as though it were an unprecedented, newsworthy event, rather than {{tvtropes|MundaneMadeAwesome| something mundane}} that happens every day. They even have a reporter ([[Cueball]]) on the spot reporting from where the ''darkness'' has spread so far.\n\nThe {{w|sunset}} is a common event.{{Citation needed}} {{w|Isaac Asimov}} based his short story {{w|Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall}} on a fictional civilization that doesn't know darkness because the planet is always illuminated by the six stars surrounding it. The story describes how people would react (mass insanity, fall of civilization) when the orbital motion of the planet eventually leads to five of the suns setting, plus one in eclipse.\n\nDescribing mundane occurrences in unusual detail, to show off how odd they really are, is something [[Randall]] has done before (for instance about dreaming in [[203: Hallucinations]]). But the caption below the main panel adds another twist to the joke by showing that the news report wasn't a mere imagine spot, but something actually happening due to the interference of Randall's final wish to his {{w|genie}}, which caused all news reporters to forget the day-night cycle.\n\nAnother possible meaning is that this comic is a reference to the way the media often talk about {{w|global warming}} as if each weather occurrence had meaning outside of its context like in [[1321: Cold]]. That take on the weather and the day-night cycle being denied because of a skewed point of view was also used on the {{w|Daily Show}}. The segment \"[http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/18l8gy/unusually-large-snowstorm Unusually Large Snowstorm]\" from February 10, 2010, used the same trope. Several Daily Show correspondents have different views on the weather based on where they are, ending with a correspondent who equates nighttime with everlasting darkness.\n\nThe caption references the fact that there is a limit to the number of wishes. It is a common rule, often used in fiction, that you get {{tvtropes|ThreeWishes|three wishes}} from a {{tvtropes|GenieInABottle|genie in a bottle}}. There usually is an added stipulation that no wish may be used to acquire more wishes. \n\nIn the title text, however, it is stated that Randall has managed to bypass the three wish limit rule. This was accomplished by using his second wish to simply make the genie unable to remember granting the speaker any wishes. He has thus used the same trick on the genie as he used here on the media. The media wish turns out '''not''' to have been his last (i.e. third), but rather wish number 406. This shows just how far, \"make someone forget something\", can go by applying it to the genie. \n\nThere is possibly an inconsistency in the comic, when seen from the title text's perspective. Since his second wish, all his wishes would have been seen as the first by the genie and thus, if the title text is true, he could have said: \"Genie, for my ''first'' wish, make everyone in the media forget about the day-night cycle.\" However, in the light of the title text (to be seen as an add on, and thus not always related directly to the comics image) he appears to voluntarily end the whole scenario by explicitly declaring it over. Whether this would finally trigger the genie to end the wishing-cycle is unknown, and depends upon the exact priority of the genie's induced amnesia over its end-of-wishes habits. \n\nIt is interesting that it was his second wish that gave him unlimited wishes. What did he wish for on wish #1? Maybe he wasted the first wish because he did not believe the genie was able to grant wishes â€“ a common error. On the other hand, he may have used the first wish to learn how to make his second wish circumvent the three rule limit. His first wish could have been to read the genie's mind to determine what he could wish for to give him unlimited wishes.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is a news anchor at a media desk and she reports:]\n:Ponytail: ...getting reports that the darkness has spread as far west as Texas.
