The gentle, romantic tone of the poem is broken by the last two words, [[:Category: Your Mom|Your Mom]]. This is an example of a {{w|maternal insult}} joke, and is phrased accordingly.\nThis is a good example of subversion of expectation. The humor of this strip is derived by the juxtaposition of lofty poetic words and mature themes being abruptly offset with a base and ''juvenile'' \"Your Mom\" joke. This is similar to and part of a running gag across the following [[89: Gravitational Mass]], [[158: Six Months]], and [[176: Before Sunrise]], in that all of them start off seemingly innocuous, but end in the abrupt quotation of \"Your Mom\".\n\nThe title text further emphasizes this and even more bluntly drives home the punchline for humorous effect.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A picture of various apartment buildings.]\n:[Text written below the picture:]\n:Shadowed city slumber silently. A second-story suite.\n:Come craving courtship, selected serendipitously\n:Crazed copulations, a salacious storm  of continuous coitus.\n:Spread, straddled, conquered.\n:Countless crashed suitors strewn carelessly.\n:Center, silken sheets sensuously caressing soft skin,\n:Contentedly sleeps your mom.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]"
