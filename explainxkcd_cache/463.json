Premier Election Solutions, the company that handled the machines, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/08/ohio-voting-machines-contained.html blamed these problems] on {{w|McAfee}} antivirus software. (The comic likely emphasizes the fact that Premier Election Solutions was formerly known as Diebold because Diebold voting machines had previously become [https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/11/13/8393084/index.htm infamous] in the United States for their poor security during the 2004 and 2006 elections, and the company changed its name to distance itself from this bad reputation.)\n\nIt is not uncommon to see computer software contracts stipulating that the vendor will warrant that software and systems delivered will not contain any viruses or malicious code (\"malware\") — a knee-jerk reaction to this is for novice management to include malware-scanning \"antivirus\" software for systems that otherwise are closed. From a computer programming standpoint, having antivirus software on an electronic voting machine doesn't make sense, because ideally the machine shouldn't be connecting to ''anything'' external (eg the internet, USB, a local network, removable drives, bluetooth...) that would leave it open to malware attacks. While there are many ways that malware can reach a computer, ultimately the computer still has to run executable code that was not distributed with it in the first place, which is something that ''no election machine should encounter'' in normal operation. Hence, the question is whether the voting machine manufacturer has taken the proper precaution preventing any external access.\n\nIdeally, voting machines (as well as ATMs and other single-purpose appliances) should be {{w|embedded system}}s, supposedly making them incapable of doing the things that might necessitate antivirus software. However, in practice, such devices are more commonly built as application programs running on ordinary Windows PCs (inside of custom-shaped cases), and they download software updates over the internet, synchronize voting data to a single \"Ballot Box\" server over a local network, use USB peripherals which could potentially be replaced by a bad actor, etc. And even embedded systems are vulnerable to many classes of malware.\n\nThe comic makes an analogy to a teacher who reassures you that he always wears a condom when teaching. While a condom could be considered \"protection,\" and therefore a good thing, common sense dictates that teachers should never end up in a situation where wearing a condom in school would be useful; this parallels the idea that while security in the form of antivirus software on voting machines could also be considered protection and a good thing, it should never be required. The comment is more likely to make people worried about why the condom is there and what purpose it's serving. Similarly, informed people might worry why a voting machine has any access to malicious executable code.\n\nIn panel one, both the {{w|facepalm}} and [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/youre-doing-it-wrong \"You're doing it wrong\"] are {{w|Internet meme}}s, used to mock someone who made a foolish mistake.\n\nThe title text refers to [[153: Cryptography]]. Voting software is also featured in [[2030: Voting Software]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above panels:]\n:Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold) has blamed Ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines' McAfee antivirus software.\n\n:[Cueball is sitting at a computer, facepalming.]\n:Cueball: Wait. \"Antivirus software\"? On voting machines? ''You're doing it wrong.''\n\n:[Cueball's friend enters the frame and speaks to Cueball.]\n:Friend: Why? Security is good, right?\n:Cueball: Of course. But, well—\n\n:Cueball: Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching.\n\n:Friend: Ah. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative—\n:Cueball: —Yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Banned from conferences]]\n[[Category:Cryptography]]\n[[Category:Computers]]"
