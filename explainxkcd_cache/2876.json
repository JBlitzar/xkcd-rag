This involves tasks like creating a launch corridor clear of any aircraft or ships, as well as ensuring that atmospheric conditions are favorable for a launch. In this comic, the RSO has noticed reports of thunderstorms downrange, and has ordered a hold as conditions are no longer favorable. [[Randall]] continues on by imagining the opposite position, a \"Range Danger Officer,\" responsible for ensuring that the flight of the vehicle is dangerous. Flying into the biggest thunderstorm may qualify as dangerous - in 1987 an ATLAS rocket launched into thunderstorm conditions by NASA was destroyed by lightning strikes that caused electrical malfunction. Finally, someone on the staff justifiably{{Citation needed}} wonders what reason there is for that position to exist.\n\nThe title text additionally imagines a Range Mischief Officer, responsible for mischief – generally defined as minor/playful annoyance. Introducing a random unknown spin may qualify, since the spin shouldn't affect the flight too much, but would make all the flight engineers nervous about the flight as they seek to understand why telemetry is inverted (or why it is not!), as they work out the cause and whether it is symptomatic of bigger underlying issues or just a technical change of reference to an otherwise correct flight trajectory. Hopefully, the spin is just axial and not end-over-end, or the rocket is [[1133: Up Goer Five|having a bad problem and will not go to space today]].\n\nThe \"Range Danger Officer\" is not an actual position at NASA or any other notable space agency. The Range Danger Officer and Range Mischief Officer titles both sound like suitable positions for [[Black Hat]], xkcd's resident [[classhole]]. This is the second holiday season comic in 3 years to depict rocket safety officers. A Range Safety Officer was also mentioned in the title text of [[2559: December 25th Launch]], where the RSO shoots down Santa so he cannot interfere with the rocket launch.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A rocket is on a launchpad with a tower next to it as seen from far away. There are two birds flying to the right of them and one bird flying to the left of them. To the left of the launchpad there is a very small building. Much farther to the right there are two smaller buildings, and a voice is emanating from the largest and right most building which also has two antennas on top. The scene is shown in black silhouette on a white background.]\n:Voice: There are reports of thunderstorms in the downrange area.\n\n:[Same scene, except there are now only two visible birds, both flying on the left side of the rocket.]\n:Voice: The Range Safety Officer has ordered a launch hold.\n\n:[Almost same scene, but panned to the right so the smallest building to the left is not shown and a third building to the right of the other two buildings can be seen. Birds are now flying with one on either side of the rocket. Two voices are now emanating from the middle building.] \n:Voice: But the Range '''''Danger''''' Officer wants to launch the rocket toward the biggest thunderstorm.\n:Voice 2: Okay, why do we even '''''have''''' that position?\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/1/18/20240103171847%21range_safety_2x.png original version of the comic], the tower next to the rocket was missing from the second panel. It was added a few hours later.\n\n*The [https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/range_safety.png standard-sized image of this comic] was initially [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/1/18/20240103171847%21range_safety_2x.png uploaded with a resolution larger] than the supposed double-sized version. This was later fixed.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Weather]]\n[[Category:Rockets]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
