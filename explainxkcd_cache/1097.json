The situation depicted in this comic is described as a \"hypochondriac's nightmare\" because [[Cueball]], expecting that the rash on his arm was some mysterious undiagnosed disease, spent several hours on {{w|WebMD}} (an online health symptom reference) looking up symptoms, yet ends up dying by slipping on a banana and getting sucked into an airplane engine. Thus he regrets wasting so much time on an ultimately fruitless task rather than something more productive to survival, such as, say, watching out for banana peels lying in front of jet engines, or at the very least, attempting to enjoy life.\n\nThe title text (in ALL CAPS thus shouting in despair) adds another level of hypochondriasm. [[Randall]] drew this particular joke to soothe his fears and reassure himself that the rash is nothing. But what if that reassurance just makes him not check out the rash, and then it turns out the rash is caused by \"death {{w|mite}}s\" (which do not actually exist){{Citation needed}} and ultimately kills him when he could have prevented it?\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball at an airport slips on a banana peel and gets sucked into a nearby jet engine.]\n:Cueball (thinking): Seriously!? '''''This''''' is what gets me? I wasted so many hours on WebMD worrying about the rash on my arm!\n\n==Trivia==\n*When first published, \"Hypochondriac\" in the title was misspelled as \"Hypoch'''r'''ondiac\". This was later fixed.\n*ICD-10 code for this situation is [http://fulldecent.blogspot.com/2012/02/new-medical-bill-theres-code-for-that.html V9733xA].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
