During political seasons, partisan voters often threaten to move away if their side loses. For Americans, this often comes to [http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/people-moving-to-canada-because-of-obamacare claims of moving to Canada].\n\nThe punchline references the tagline \"If you die in the game, you die in real life\" from the 2006 horror movie {{w|Stay Alive}} (released a few months before this comic), where people die in real life soon after their characters are killed in a certain video game. The idea was also present in ''{{w|The Matrix}}'': \"If you're killed in the Matrix, you die here?\" There is also a Yahoo Answers thread about this question.\n\nTaken literally, it is obviously true, as Canada '''is''', arguably, part of reality.{{cn}} It really is \"all real\" as the title text says.\n\nFrom ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'':\n{{quote|This was a hit with Canadians, but I think they just like anything that mentions them at all.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two men stand talking to each other.]\n:Cueball: If we lose this election, I'm moving to Canada.\n:Friend: You say that every year.\n:Cueball: I mean it this time.\n\n:Friend: Well, becoming a citizen takes work. Meanwhile, you have no money, half an art degree, and it's the start of winter. You'll freeze to death in the streets.\n:Cueball: Whatever.\n\n:[Friend raises his hands.]\n:Friend: No, don't you get it? If you die in Canada, you die in R<u>EA</u>L <u>LIFE</u>!\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to [http://blag.xkcd.com/2007/03/16/mit-programming-team/ Randall's blag], a team named “If You Die in Canada, You Die in Real Life” entered the 2007 MIT BattleCode programming competition. They won the \"Best Team Name\" award.\n\n{{Comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Politics]]"
