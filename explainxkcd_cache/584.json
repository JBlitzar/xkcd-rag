If you were a sort function, you'd never break the nlogn barrier.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] is trying to decide if he wants to stay with [[Ponytail]], who he is currently dating, or leave her and have a relationship with [[Megan]]. The comic suggests that no matter which one he chooses, he will never truly achieve happiness because of his longing for the option he chose not to take. In a sense this is a {{w|no-win situation}}. No matter what interesting stuff he does (sex or otherwise) with Ponytail, he will forever be thinking of Megan, and vice versa. This goes on even after he dies, where he is buried next to one of them and thinks he would rather have been buried next to the other. This might have been averted if [[Cueball]] had chosen polygamy and had relationships with both women, although then he might have cause to wonder what ''both'' the single-relationships could have been like.\n\nThe title text is referring to a concept in computer science. All {{w|Comparison sort|comparison-based sorting algorithms}} are incapable of sorting an arbitrary set of ''n'' values faster than order of ''n''Â·log(''n''). On the other hand, non-comparison sorting algorithms (e.g., {{w|bucket sort}}) with external knowledge of the distribution of the values can sort them in time of order ''n''. If [[Cueball]] were capable of establishing an external scale, he could use a non-comparison sort, but as he does not know what the best thing for him is, he is stuck with comparisons and thus can't achieve better performance.\n\nThis comic is possibly a sequel to [[310: Commitment]], and two-way choices are referenced in [[3076: The Roads Both Taken]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding hands with Ponytail, while he is looking at Megan to the far right.]\n:[Below this first central panel there are two arrows that direct the comic into a pair of different paths. Beneath each of the next three double panels there is a small arrow pointing straight down.]\n\n:(Left path) [Cueball has turned away from Megan (off-screen) and is now kissing Ponytail, but he is thinking about Megan.]\n:(Right path) [Cueball walks away from Ponytail (off-screen) and reaches out to Megan, but he is thinking about Ponytail.]\n\n:(Left path) [Cueball is performing cunnilingus on Ponytail, he is still thinking about Megan.]\n:(Right path) [Cueball and Megan have sex on the arm of a chair, he is still thinking about Ponytail.]\n\n:(Left path) [Cueball and Ponytail are drawing something together, but still he is still thinking about Megan.]\n:(Right path) [Cueball and Megan are hiking together, but he is thinking about Ponytail.]\n\n:(Left path) [Cueball and Ponytail are holding hands looking at each other, and he continues to think of Megan.]\n:(Right path) [Cueball and Megan are holding hands looking at each other, and he continues to think of Ponytail.]\n\n:[Below the previous two panels two longer arrows again reunite into one central panel.]\n:[Two gravestones are next to each other. One of them (Cueball's) is thinking about a third gravestone (for the girl he did not choose).]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
