Although it gets kind of squashed under my helmet.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic seems to be a parable about the perils of love during wartime. Our protagonist is seen here leaning against his pack behind a low wall, surely a good hiding spot for any gentleman with a rifle and scope. Judging by the letter he's in the midst of writing, he has a complex relationship with Cordelia. On the one hand, she's attractive. On the other hand, she's a hostile combatant, as evidenced by the shots fired mid-missive. Cordelia's fire works against her, though, as her volley of shots has revealed her own position atop the maintenance shed. We can presume that in a matter of minutes, this love affair will go sour as the love letter is wrapped around a live grenade and \"delivered,\" so to speak. War is indeed hell.\n\nAs to the title text, the green berets are worn only by Special Forces soldiers. It takes a lot of training to become a green beret, and as evidenced by our protagonist's clever use of decoys to outwit a sniper, he may be qualified for the honor. However, evidence for his naiveté is given immediately thereafter, as he confesses that he wears a beret under his helmet — thus revealing our protagonist's true identity as [[Beret Guy]] and explaining how he fell in love with an enemy soldier actively trying to kill him.{{cn}} Then again, he does not have a choice, since [[291: Dignified|he has stapled the beret on his head.]]\n\n\"Cordelia\" is possibly a reference to [http://atoracle.wikidot.com/en-cordelia-rosalind Cordelia Rosalind]—the sniper from the {{w|Miniature wargaming|miniature game}} ''{{w|Anima: Beyond Fantasy#Anima: Tactics|Anima: Tactics}}''. Alternatively, it may be a reference to {{w|List of Vorkosigan Saga characters#Barrayarans|Cordelia Naismith}} from {{w|Lois McMaster Bujold}}'s ''{{w|Shards of Honor}}''. In the book, Cordelia Naismith and Lord Aral Vorkosigan are on opposite sides of the Beta-Barrayar war, and fall in love while forced to spend a week in each other's company on an unpopulated planet. This may be further corroborated by the green color of Beret Guy's uniform, which is very similar to the color used for the uniforms of the Barrayan Imperial Service.\n\nIt is also possible that Beret Guy and Cordelia are playing a video game, in a virtual reality, or in some similar context in which being blown up by grenades would not actually kill Cordelia, which would explain why Beret Guy would write such a missive.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy with a green helmet on is sitting on the ground behind a low wall, leaning against his pack and writing a letter.]\n:My Dearest Cordelia,\n:it has been far too long since I last gazed\n:upon your lithe and supple body through my\n:telescopic sights, and I fear you may have\n:found a superior vantage poin—\n\n:''BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!''\n\n:—a splendid effort, my love, but your shots\n:find only a decoy, and reveal your position atop\n:the maintenance shed.\n\n:I pray this missive and my grenades find you well.\n\n:War is hell.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
