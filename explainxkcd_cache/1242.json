It is interesting to note how people react to the items near the bottom right of the chart \"scary things with not-very-scary names\" when compared to how they may react to items in the upper left \"not-very-scary things with scary names\". Some of the entries on the chart are especially interesting examples considering that portions of the names that are associated with significant historical or cultural events and themes. i.e. Chernobyl Packet, Demon Core. All items are described in the [[#Table|table below]] including the title text on Helvetica Scenario.\n\nOn the chart, things toward the right are scary/dangerous/very bad, while things toward the top ''sound'' scary without ''necessarily'' being scary.\n\nNote that [[Randall]] uses similar diagrams in [[388: Fuck Grapefruit]], [[1501: Mysteries]] and [[2466: In Your Classroom]], which also contain different items. The first two also have an extra point, and the last two extra points mentioned in the title text. Only the first and the last comics points are also off the chart, whereas for the second the description of the point is too long to fit on the chart. Extra info outside the chart is also used in the title text of [[1785: Wifi]], but it is a line graph, not a scatter plot.\n\n===Table===\n*This table lists the entries from least to most scary, including the ''entry'' mentioned in the title text. \n*To begin with it is sorted from most scary name to least scary name.\n**The assigned percentage values assumes a linear scale and assigns ''flesh eating bacteria'' with the point (100%, 100%). \n**This is simply the easiest way to list the entries as there is no mention of the scale. \n**As is clear from the title text, \"flesh eating bacteria\" is not an absolute, simply the highest in this particular sample; there are things more scary than 100%!\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\"| Approximate Apparent Scariness\n! scope=\"col\"| Approximate True Scariness\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Necrotizing fasciitis|Flesh-eating bacteria}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|m !}}100%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|l !}}100%}}\n|As the name suggests, bacteria that eat (or more accurately, releases toxins that destroy) your skin and muscle.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/Chernobyl-packet.html Chernobyl Packet]}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|k !}}95%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|a !}}4%}}\n|A network packet that induces a {{w|broadcast storm}} or network meltdown. It is an analogous reference to the {{w|Chernobyl disaster}}, but otherwise has no relation: one did not cause the disaster, nor does it concern literal packets of radioactive material from Chernobyl.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Kessler syndrome|Kessler Syndrome}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|k !}}90%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|d !}}53%}}\n|A hypothetical scenario where low Earth orbit objects collide, creating  debris which increases the risk of more collisions, leading to a cascade effect which could severely hinder  exploration and satellite technologies for many decades. It has been mentioned in {{w|Gravity (2013 film)}}.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Demon core|Demon Core}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|j !}}87%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|h !}}73%}}\n|A subcritical mass of plutonium that was involved in two separate fatal incidents at Los Alamos laboratory in 1945 and 1946. In both cases, the core was accidentally placed into a configuration where it went supercritical and exposed an experimenter to fatal doses of radiation. The second is more notable, where Louis Slotin held two halves of a beryllium neutron reflector apart with a flat head screwdriver which slipped, suddenly causing the contained plutonium core to become supercritical and delivering a fatal dose of radiation. This is later referenced in [[2593: Deviled Eggs]].\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|Bomb Calorimeters}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|h !}}67%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|b !}}28%}}\n|A device for measuring heat of combustion of a reaction in a pressure vessel. It does not interact with explosive devices directly, though the chemicals a bomb calorimeter would be called upon to measure are occasionally explosive or dangerous, and a carelessly operated calorimeter could start a fire.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Avian influenza virus|Bird Flu}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|h !}}57%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|g !}}72%}}\n|An illness caused by strains of influenza adapted for birds, which is generally very deadly in humans. Should the virus adapt for human to human transmission, a pandemic can quickly result. Since birds can travel great distances quickly, it is generally already widespread and difficult to contain.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Nuclear football|Nuclear Football}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|g !}}52%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|k !}}94%}}\n|An aluminum Zero Halliburton briefcase which is used by the President of the United States to authorize nuclear attack. A military aide carrying the football is always near the president.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Sulfur mustard|Mustard Gas}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|f !}}47%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|c !}}50%}}\n|A chemical warfare agent which causes blisters and severe irritation on skin and lung tissue.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Antimicrobial resistance|Superbug}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|e !}}39%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|j !}}83%}}\n|Antibiotic resistant bacteria. The growing use of antibiotics has caused some bacteria to evolve to become resistant to the antibiotics. A \"superbug\" refers to a scenario where a bacteria evolves to become resistant to all antibiotics, for example, {{w|MRSA}}. Thanks to popular culture, however, the term \"superbug\" usually makes the audience think \"a bug with superpowers\", such as {{w|Atom Ant}}.\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Criticality accident|Criticality Incident}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|d!}}22%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|i !}}74%}}\n|An unexpected and uncontrolled nuclear reaction. This occurs when a system that should be sub-critical becomes critical by accident (a term devised by Louis Slotin, as seen above).\n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Soil liquefaction|Soil Liquefaction}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|c !}}16%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|e !}}54%}}\n|A phenomenon where wet soil loses its strength and becomes temporarily liquid, capable of swallowing people and buildings, especially after earthquakes or torrential rains. Liquefaction can cause landslides; landslides can cause more liquefaction.  Once the earthquake stops, the ground becomes solid again, trapping whatever was submerged. \n|-\n|{{Nowrap|{{w|Gray goo|Grey Goo}}}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|b !}}5%}}\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|f !}}69%}}\n|A hypothetical end-of-world scenario where self-replicating nanobots consume all matter. It is (partially) illustrated in [[865: Nanobots]].\n|-\n|Helvetica Scenario<br>(from the title text)\n|{{Nowrap|{{Hs|z !}}N/A}}\n|{{Hs|m !}}Off the chart\n|This scenario is also in the title text of [[683: Science Montage]]: \"...We have a Helvetica scenario!\". The scenario is a fictional experiment, presented in Switzerland (Helvetica), which assumes that removing only the nucleus (the center of an atom) of a calcium atom in one's skin, but still leaving the electron shell at its position, would cause a massive reaction ending up in heavy mutations. The Helvetica scenario was made up by the BBC comedy show {{w|Look Around You}} in the pilot episode, which can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4CRCJUmWsM&t=5m53s here (at 5:53)]. The fact that the term {{w|Helvetica}} is more commonly known as referring to a very-commonly-used modern typeface makes the name sound like it should refer to a much less serious situation.\n|}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the ''[[What If? (book)|What If?]]'' book, in the book-exclusive article \"No More DNA\", this graph is shown redrawn with \"Destroying Angel\" added to it, with both its Approximate True Scariness and Approximate Apparent Scariness at an off-the-chart 110%. Destroying Angel is the common name for ''Amanita bisporigera'', a poisonous mushroom which causes irreversible damage at the cellular level in a way the article uses as an analogue to the scenario of a person's DNA being removed. Other items in the chart have also moved positions â€“ most noticeably, Nuclear Football has moved right to a 120% Approximate True Scariness.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A scatter-plot, with 12 labeled dots.
