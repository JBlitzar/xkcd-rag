She points out that there are really only around five lava-filled volcano craters in the world right now. \n\nIn true Black Hat fashion, he responds to this by creating a new lava lake on a nearby golf course. Given that Megan was still waiting when Black Hat came back, the attention span of most people is shorter than the time it takes lava lakes to form and that people generally do not intentionally build golf courses directly over active volcanoes,{{cn}} Black Hat would've needed to dig at least 8 kilometers of earth within a very short timespan. Since this action was prompted by Megan's remark, Black Hat likely did not build or move anything capable of making a lava lake to the golf course beforehand.\n\nThe title text mentions that golf balls will float on lava, making recovering them from {{w|Hazard (golf)|hazards}} easier (man-made obstacles such as sand or water, with sinking in the latter being the more obvious hazard to change). The density of a normal golf ball is about 1.13 grams per cubic centimeter, which is significantly less than the 2.4 ~ 2.9 grams per cubic centimeter of lava. It ''would'' be very easy to retrieve golf balls from lava because of this, if it were not for the fact that lava is hot.{{cn}} Lava is around 800 °C, while most golf balls are made of [https://thegolfmine.com/are-golf-balls-flammable/ materials that ignite] at 400-500 °C, and it could also be somewhat awkward for any hand that goes to retrieve it. Not to mention that the interaction of lava with solids at {{w|Standard temperature and pressure|STP}} [https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/rockfall-halemaumau tends to be violent]. It would presumably also be extremely difficult to wipe lava from the surface of a golf ball, both while the lava is fresh and then changing to different challenges as it cools. So even if you did retrieve the ball from the lava lake, you might not be able to use it again.\n\nThese may be the 5 volcano lakes that the comic references ({{w|Lava lake#List of volcanoes having displayed past or present lava lake activity|source}}):\n* {{w|Erta Ale}} in Ethiopia\n* {{w|Mount Erebus}} on Ross Island, Antarctica\n* Kīlauea {{w|Halemaʻumaʻu}} on Hawaiʻi (Big Island) [no active lake in September 2024]\n* {{w|Mount Nyiragongo|Nyiragongo}} in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* {{w|Mount Michael}} on Saunders Island, South Sandwich Islands\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Black Hat are talking, with Megan holding up one hand towards Black Hat]\n:Megan: People think volcano craters are full of lava, but that’s rare.
