Although I have to admit it sounds prestigious.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] has installed {{w|SwiftKey}} on his smartphone and brags about this to [[Megan]]. SwiftKey is a product that is installable on {{w|iOS}}/{{w|Android (operating system)|Android}}-based phones and tablets.\n\nCueball explains that if you type space bar on the keyboard it auto-completes the word you are currently typing founded on its best guess, and then if you continue to press space it will add new words using this guessing process based on the previous word(s) and what it believes is the most likely words you would use in a sentence containing the previous word(s).\n\nMegan asks what happens if you begin a new message by just using space to automatically create a text. Cueball's best guess is that it begins with the word SwiftKey has found to be the typical starting word and then continues as normal from that.\n\nMegan then realizes that in this way it builds up his \"typical\" sentence and she tries this over the next eight small frames: ''I am so sorry- that's never happened before.''\n\n\"I am so sorry– that's never happened before.\" is a typical excuse for a mishap, usually when {{tvtropes|TheLoinsSleepTonight|one fails to produce an erection when it is needed}}, or alternatively {{w|Premature ejaculation|maintain one}} for a mutually satisfying length of time. Such a phrase being quoted by an algorithm implies that such mishaps are common, and therefore \"I am so sorry– that's never happened before.\" is a lie.\n\nSwiftKey has noticed their inclusion in xkcd and have created a blog post for other users to comment with their default phrase when they hit the \"central prediction key\". The results are [http://www.swiftkey.com/swiftkey-on-xkcd pretty funny] (the site now redirects to a website asking to download the keyboard, an archived version can be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20190226120542/https://blog.swiftkey.com/swiftkey-on-xkcd/ here]). In addition, Reddit users have a similar model creating [https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator /r/subredditsimulator], which is populated by bots generating submissions and comments based on the language of their subreddits.\n\nIn the title text, a {{w|Markov chain}} refers to a system that transitions between a countable number of states, based only on the current state and none of the previous ones that led up to it. SwiftKey follows this property since it provides outputs based only on the most recently entered word or words, not the whole sentence.\n\n\"Massachusetts Institute of America\" is a nonexistent organization. The name appears to have formed by combining \"{{w|Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}\" and either \"[Field] Institute of America\" (e.g. Mining) (Wikipedia links needed) or \"United States of America\". This illustrates the memoryless property of a Markov chain; after generating \"Massachusetts Institute of\", SwiftKey may have attempted to predict the next word using only the last \"of\" or \"Institute of\". Since it was not considering the word \"Massachusetts\" at all, the word \"America\" was viewed as the most likely follow-up.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball showing his phone to Megan.]\n:Cueball: Have you tried SwiftKey? It's got the first decent language model I've seen. It learns from your SMS/Email archives what words you use together most often.\n\n:[Cueball and Megan in a frameless panel, with Megan now holding Cueball's phone.]\n:Cueball: Spacebar inserts its best guess. So if I type \"The Empi\" and hit space three times, it types \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n:Megan: What if you mash space in a blank message?\n\n:[Zoomed in on Megan looking at Cueball's phone, with Cueball now off-frame to the left.]\n:Cueball: I guess it fills in your most likely first word, then the word that usually follows it...\n:Megan: So it builds up your \"typical\" sentence. Cool! Let's see yours!\n:Cueball: Uh—\n\n:[Eight small frames arranged in panel space, 2 frames wide by 4 frames high, showing each word added by Swiftkey as Megan hits space each time:]\n:SwiftKey: I\n:SwiftKey: Am\n:SwiftKey: So\n:SwiftKey: Sorry—\n:SwiftKey: That's\n:SwiftKey: Never\n:SwiftKey: Happened\n:SwiftKey: Before.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Smartphones]]"
