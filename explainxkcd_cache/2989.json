The dial shows different values for the constant, implying that it can be changed, which would be disturbing as a lot of what our current understanding of physics assumes it can't be. Thankfully, in reality there is no way to change the Boltzmann constant, so the comic is making fun of the idea of a scientist casually adjusting a fixed law of physics as if it were something simple like room temperature.\n\nIf the Boltzmann constant could be changed, it would affect how we experience temperature. The energy range on the dial relative to the actual Boltzmann constant might correspond to (or feel like?) apparent temperatures of 15°C (59°F) on the left, to 29°C (84°F) on the right, because raising the value of the constant would decrease the apparent temperature. There have previously been control panels for properties of the universe in [[1620: Christmas Settings]] and [[1763: Catcalling]]. A thermometer including units compatible with this thermostat (after dividing by 2/3) is shown in [[2292: Thermometer]].\n\nThe title text builds on the absurdity of being able to adjust the Boltzmann constant. It suggests that if the constant could be changed, hopefully it would only affect the air in the room and not other substances. In particular, the metabolism of the room's occupants is hopefully unaffected. Imagining that this strange version of an HVAC ({{w|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning}}) system could contain such a change to ''just'' the room's air shows the ridiculousness of trying to isolate the effects of altering a universal constant.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A black circular dial is shown with a white indicator line at the upper right.
