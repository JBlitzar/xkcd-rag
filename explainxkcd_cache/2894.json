In the comic he is filling out a form to register for a research account. Such accounts are typically intended for people doing serious work in the relevant field, who need access to the materials provided to support that work. Cueball, however, has filled out “other/none” for institution, and “to win an argument with someone in a group chat” for “reason for requesting access to our datasets”, making it clear that his interest is both petty and personal. While this may be honest, it doesn't match the assumed purpose, and he may be worried that it might mean that his registration would be rejected or subsequently cancelled. So he then selects all and deletes his previous justification, replacing it with “independent research”, which is an accurate, if generic, explanation. Randall is undoubtedly familiar with such registration forms from doing background research for xkcd and What If?.\n\nIn the title text, he says that his research focuses on “extreme pettiness and unwillingness to let anything go” (in all caps), further reinforcing the reason that he is doing this solely to win an argument. It is possible this is a pun on different meanings of the word \"focus\" - while the question about the focus of one's research is typically about the subject matter they are researching (raft building in fire ants, etc), Cueball appears to be writing about what drives his desire to do research. Similarly, Cueball is not doing research INTO pettiness, but rather is focusing entirely on his pettiness as his main reason to perform research and achieve his goals. Of course, there is a focused area of research related to individuals who obsessively pursue matters disproportionately to their severity, who are known as {{w|querulant|querulants}}.\n\nIt is not uncommon for online forms to include fields like these, where it's unclear what, if anything, will be done with the input, and therefore how much it matters what is entered. It's unlikely that anyone would have the capacity to review all the freetext answers submitted, and in any case, by the time they did so, Cueball would presumably have already accessed the materials he wanted.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball sits at a desk, typing at his laptop computer.]\n\n:[Above him, there is a box indicating his computer screen.]\n\n:[Caption above screen:] Application for research account\n\n:[Under the caption, there is a panel, representing the computer screen; in the panel: (cut off from above) \"Institution: Other/none\", where the option has been selected from a drop-down menu. Under that is written \"Reason for requesting access to our datasets:\", under which is a comment field where \"To win an argument with someone in a group chat\" has been written. Under that, two long bubbles containing the words \"Select all\" and \"Delete\" separate another panel, with a panel featuring the comment field with \"Independent research\" written. The cursor can still be seen blinking.]\n\n:[Caption below the comic panel:]\n:I never know how honest to be on these forms.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]"
