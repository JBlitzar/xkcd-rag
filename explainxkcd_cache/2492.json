Equations are normally voiced out loud either by their names (\"mass-energy equivalence\") or by saying the parts out loud using normal linguistic rules (\"E equals m ''c'' squared\"). This comic instead asserts that equations are meant to be said out loud like words, using their own set of phonic rules.\n\nThough the premise may initially seem absurd, some nerds have both the trait of using equations as commonly as others might chat and that of finding it entertaining to coin amusing new words (\"input\", \"pwn\"). Saying the equations more rapidly can speed up work or make work seem more enjoyable.  This phenomenon is called {{w|clipping (morphology)|clipping}}.\n\nUsing clipped or verbalized forms of equations is sometimes standard practice within a given field. The equation for continuously compounding interest A=Pe<sup>rt</sup> is commonly taught and discussed as the \"pert\" equation, while the definitions of the main trigonometric functions is similarly taught and discussed as SOH-CAH-TOA: sine&nbsp;= opposite/hypotenuse, cosine&nbsp;= adjacent/hypotenuse, and tangent&nbsp;= opposite/adjacent. These particular \"corrections\" are all nonstandard, however, occasionally conflicting with more normal readings like \"pivnert\" for the ideal gas law. The \"corrections\" are also internally inconsistent, with equal signs and exponents sometimes omitted and sometimes included and intermediate vowels.\n\n===Equations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Name\n!Representation\n!Pronounciation \n!Explanation \n|- \n|{{w|Newton's law of universal gravitation}}\n|F = G(m₁m₂/r²)\n|Fuh-''JAM''-er\n|⟨F⟩, gravitational force, is pronounced /f/. ⟨G⟩, the gravitational constant, is pronounced like the soft G /dʒ/ despite the following /æ/, recalling {{link|http://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1989:_IMHO|the .gif controversy}}. The ⟨m⟩s, mass 1 and 2, are elided into a single /m/, and ⟨r⟩, the distance between the masses, is pronounced /ɹ/. The subscripts and exponent are silent.\n|- \n|{{w|Mass–energy equivalence}}\n|E = mc²\n|''EM''-cah-too\n|⟨E⟩, energy, is pronounced like the short E /ɛ/. ⟨m⟩, mass, is pronounced /m/. ⟨c⟩, the speed of light, is pronounced like the hard C /k/ and its exponent ⟨²⟩ is read as the numeral two /tu/. The resulting pronunciation is similar to {{w|Encanto}}\n|- \n|{{w|Pythagorean theorem}}\n|a² + b² = c²\n|at-''BOOT''-coot\n|⟨a⟩, the length of the base, is pronounced like the short A /æ/. ⟨b⟩, the length of the height, is pronounced /b/. ⟨c⟩, the length of the hypotenuse, is pronounced like the hard C /k/. Each exponent ⟨²⟩ is pronounced /t/ as a clipping of \"two\".\n|- \n|{{w|Area of a circle}}\n|A = πr²\n|''APP''-er-too\n|⟨A⟩, area, is pronounced like the short A /æ/. ⟨π⟩ is pronounced /p/ after the sound represented by pi in the Greek alphabet. ⟨r⟩, the length of the radius, is pronounced /ɹ/ and its exponent ⟨²⟩ is read as the numeral two /tu/. The resulting pronunciation is similar to the word \"{{wiktionary|aperture}}\", the diameter of optical equipment such as telescopes and cameras.\n|- \n|{{w|Entropy_(information_theory)|Shannon entropy}}\n|H = −∑pᵢlog(pᵢ)\n|Ha-''SPLOG''-pee\n|⟨H⟩, entropy, is pronounced /h/. The negative sign is omitted. ⟨∑⟩, the summation sign, is pronounced /s/ after the sound represented by sigma ⟨Σ⟩ in the Greek alphabet. The first ⟨pᵢ⟩ is pronounced /p/ with its subscript elided or left silent. ⟨㏒⟩, the usual mathematical notation for logarithm, is read in full as /lɔɡ/ or /lɑɡ/. The second ⟨pᵢ⟩ is read in full as /pi/ in the usual English manner of handling terminal ⟨i⟩s.\n|-\n|{{w|Ideal gas law}}\n|PV = nrt\n|''PAV''-nurt\n|A variation on the correct formatting PV&nbsp;= nRT and its more common byname \"pivnert\". ⟨P⟩, pressure, is pronounced /p/. ⟨V⟩, volume, is pronounced /v/. ⟨n⟩, the {{w|amount of substance}}, is pronounced /n/. ⟨r⟩, the {{w|ideal gas constant}}, is pronounced /ɹ/. ⟨t⟩, temperature, is pronounced /t/. \n|-\n|{{w|Euler's identity}}\n|e<sup>iπ</sup> = −1\n|''EYE''-pin\n|⟨<sup>i</sup>⟩, the {{w|imaginary unit}}, or ⟨e<sup>i</sup>⟩, {{w|Euler's number}} raised to the i power, is pronounced as the long I /aɪ/. ⟨<sup>π</sup>⟩ is pronounced /p/ after the sound represented by pi in the Greek alphabet. ⟨−1⟩ is pronounced /n/, presumably as a severe clipping of \"negative one\". The silence or elision of the initial e mirrors the usual reading of {{w|Euler's formula}} e<sup>ix</sup>&nbsp;= cos&nbsp;x&nbsp;+ i&nbsp;sin&nbsp;x as \"cis&nbsp;x\".\n|-\n|{{w|Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton's_second_law|Newton's 2nd law of motion}}\n|F = ma\n|''FEE''-mah\n|⟨F⟩, the force of motion, is pronounced /f/. ⟨=⟩, the equals sign, is read as the long E /i/. ⟨m⟩, mass, is pronounced /m/. ⟨a⟩, acceleration, is pronounced like the short A /ɑː/. The resulting pronunciation is similar to {{wiktionary|FEMA}}, the United States' {{w|Federal Emergency Management Agency}}.\n|-\n|{{w|Wave equation}} (1D)\n|∂²u/(∂t²) = c(∂²u/(∂x²))\n|''DOOT'' cah-''DOOX''\n|A mistake for the correct equation ∂²u/∂*t²&nbsp;= c²(∂²u/∂*x²). In the notation marking the second partial derivatives, each ⟨∂²⟩ is pronounced /d/ and each fraction bar and ⟨∂⟩ is silent. Each ⟨u⟩, amplitude, is pronounced /u/. ⟨t⟩, time, is pronounced /t/. ⟨c⟩, speed, is pronounced like the hard C /k/. ⟨x⟩, the distance along the measured dimension, is pronounced /ks/. The exponents are all silent.\n|-\n|{{w|Derivative#Definition|Derivative}}\n|f′(x) = lim<sub>h→0</sub> (f(x+h)−f(x))/h\n|''FAX''-lim-oh ''FAX''-uh-fox\n|⟨f′(x)⟩, the first derivative of a function with respect to an independent variable, is pronounced /fæks/ like {{w|fax machine|the machine}}. ⟨lim<sub>h→0</sub>⟩, the limit as h approaches zero, is pronounced /lɪmoʊ/ like {{w|limousine|the vehicle}}. ⟨f(x+h)⟩, the function with respect to the independent variable and another value an infinitessimally small distance away, is pronounced as /fæksə/ and ⟨f(x)⟩, the function with respect to the independent variable by itself, as /fɑks/ so that together they sound like \"fax a fox\". The ⟨h⟩ divisor is silent, like most terminal Hs in English.\n|-\n|{{w|Quadratic formula}}\n|x = (−b±√(b²−4ac))/(2a)\n|za-''BO''-ba fak-''TOH''-ah\n|⟨x⟩, the independent variable, is pronounced /z/ similar to the initial X in the names {{wiktionary|Xerxes}} and {{wiktionary|Xavier}}. The negative sign is omitted. Each ⟨a⟩, ⟨b⟩, and ⟨c⟩, the coefficients of the equation, is pronounced /ɑ/, /b/, and /k/ respectively. The ⟨4⟩ is read as /f/ and the ⟨2⟩ as /t/, with an /oʊ/ added to keep the resulting word closer to \"sohcahtoa\".\n|-\n|{{w|Schrödinger equation}} (3D)\n|Eψ = (−ℏ²/2*m)∇²ψ + (q²/r)ψ\n|\"Epsihootamoo doopsiquorps\"\n|An application of the general equation Eψ&nbsp;= Ĥψ when applied to 3 dimensions without regard to time or relativistic effects. The missing 4πε₀ from the divisor in the second (potential energy) term can be handwaved by assuming that the other terms are using units customized for quantum mechanics, rather than standard metric ones. ⟨E⟩, energy, is pronounced /ɛ/. ⟨ψ⟩, the {{w|wave function}}, is read out in full as /psi/, /psaɪ/, or /psə/ the first 2 times and then the last time as /ps/, the sound represented by psi in the Greek alphabet. The negative sign is omitted. ⟨ℏ⟩, {{w|Planck's constant}}, is pronounced /h/. ⟨2⟩ is read as /t/. ⟨m⟩, mass, is pronounced /m/. ⟨{{w|nabla symbol|∇}}⟩, the {{w|Laplace operator}}, is pronounced /d/ after the sound represented by delta in the Greek alphabet. ⟨q⟩ and ⟨r⟩, the charge and distance, are pronounced /kw/ and /ɹ/ following their standard use in English words. The exponents are silent.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n[Each equation is bordered, with a pronunciation guide beneath.]\n\nCommonly Mispronounced Equations\n\n'''Row 1'''\n\nF = G m₁m₂/r² <br>\nFUH-'''''JAM'''''-ER\n\nE = mc² <br>\n'''''EM'''''-CAH-TOO\n\na² + b² = c² <br>\nAT-'''''BOOT'''''-COOT\n\n\n'''Row 2'''\n\nA = πr² <br>\n'''''APP'''''-ER-TOO\n\nH = −Σpᵢlog pᵢ <br>\nHA-'''''SPLOG'''''-PEE\n\nPV = nrt <br>\n'''''PAV'''''-NURT\n\n\n'''Row 3'''\n\ne<sup>iπ</sup> = −1 <br>\n'''''EYE'''''-PIN\n\nF = ma <br>\n'''''FEE'''''-MAH\n\n∂²u/(∂t²) = c ∂²u/(∂x²) <br>\n'''''DOOT''''' CAH-'''''DOOX'''''\n\n\n'''Row 4'''\n\nf'(x) = lim<sub>h→0</sub> f(x+h) − f(x) / h <br>\n'''''FAX'''''-LIM-OH '''''FAX'''''-UH-FOX\n\nx = −b ± √(b² − 4ac) / (2a) <br>\nZA-'''''BO'''''-BA FAK-'''''TOH'''''-AH\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category: Language]]"
