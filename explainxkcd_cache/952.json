The joke is in the irony of having to find something that is used to find other things. Cueball interrupts Black Hat before he can make the obvious joke. The same comic technique is used later in [[1059: Bel-Air]]. Currently no product exists that will locate a stud finder, although online review compilations are useful for finding the right stud finder to buy.\n\nStuds are vertical wood members in {{w|Framing_(construction)|wood-framed construction}} common in North America, although steel framing has become a popular alternative. These supports reinforce a wall at regular intervals, typically 16 inches (about 40 cm), and at corners, windows, and doors.\n\nOne might want to know the locations of studs within a wall for installing wiring, mounting shelves and heavy objects to walls, or in this comic, hanging a picture. In constructions with mostly solid walls, discovering (and avoiding) any previously installed electric cables or pipes is as important a prelude to any new drilling of holes or hammering of nails, and the same or similar detectors aim to reduce that risk.\n\nThere are circumstances that can fool stud finders. Most are designed for the drywall-over-wood-framing construction, and can be fooled by older {{w|Lath_and_plaster|plaster and lath}} construction where the density is much more uniform throughout the length of the wall. Lower quality stud finders can also be fooled by things like moisture in the drywall or wiring within the wall cavity, and may thus beep when there is not a stud behind the scanned location. As a result, many people will try alternatives such as using a magnet to find the drywall screws or nails, or tapping a finishing nail through the wall to see if there is a stud underneath.\n\nAt the title text, [[Randall]] just gives up. Assuming there was no electrostatic interference, a stud finder going off randomly would indicate lots and lots of studs at random places that change position. \n\nThe idea of a \"something doer doer\" was explored again in [[1821: Incinerator]], the title text of [[2376: Curbside]], and [[2382: Ballot Tracker Tracker]]. [[2222: Terminator: Dark Fate]] also features a \"person stopper stopper\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat sits on a couch, reading a book. Cueball is approaching him from behind the couch holding a picture in a frame, a screwdriver, and some screws.]\n:Cueball: Have you seen my stud finder? I've looked everywhere.\n:Black Hat: It sounds like you may be interested in my new product, a—\n:Cueball: Shut up.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Recursion]]"
