[[Cueball]] points out the opening sequence to his friend and states that it should be considered art.\n\nWhen the chorus sets in and the song unfolds its lyrical brilliancy, his friend has no other comment to make except that there must be something wrong with Cueball, as it turns out to be the song \"{{w|Mickey (Toni Basil song)|Mickey}}\", performed in 1982 by one-hit-wonder {{w|Toni Basil}}. The lyrics, as well as the instrumentation of the song, were in fact rather simple, being a perfect example of {{w|Bubblegum pop|bubblegum pop}} in the early 1980s.\n\nCueball's actions might be seen as a critical approach towards over-interpreting music. The comic's title, as well as the stereo setup depicted, could perhaps also denote a sidesweep on {{w|audiophiles}}.\n\nThe title text parodies a line from the song and links it with the incomprehension of Cueball's friend.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and his friend are listening to music on a stereo.]\n:Cueball: I'm telling you, listen right here to the sets of rising notes following the opening section.\n:Friend: Uh huh.\n:[Cueball indicates stereo.]\n:Cueball: And then right here, the transition into the chorus. <u>This</u> is music. This is <u>art</u>!\n:[Cueball dances along with the music.]\n:Stereo: Oh Mickey, you so fine, you so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey! *clap* *clap* Hey Mickey!\n:Friend: There's something wrong with you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
