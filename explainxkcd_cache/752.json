This may be applied to a romantic relationship (possibly with Blondie) but is equally applicable to any (big) decision, like migrating to another country, changing the job or, as in this case, fulfilling one's dreams.\n\nAfter Megan has said this, Blondie thinks for some time (in the beat panel). When she finally decides to ask Megan something, Megan cuts her off to say that she wants to be a storm chaser. \n\nIn the last panel we see that both, Megan and Blondie, have become {{w|Storm chasing|storm chasers}} â€” individuals who pursue severe weather conditions, for either scientific investigation or providing media coverage, or simply for adventure. Ironically, chasing adverse weather, especially tornadoes, is more dangerous than the source of either character's original phobia. Indeed, one's ability to control the risk while being near a tornado is far less than one's ability to control the risk of being bitten by a snake; the tornado is violent and unpredictable, while snakes only attack humans when they feel threatened. Additionally, one needs to deliberately expose oneself to the snake in order to have any risk of being attacked.\n\nThis comic may be related to the movies {{w|Snakes on a Plane}} (if not the similar fears of  {{w|Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones}}, instead), {{w|Twister (1996 film)|Twister}} and {{w|Thelma & Louise}}. The first two cover the issues of snakes and tornados. The last of these movies has two women friends on a road trip, and in the end they kiss, and there have been [http://www.etonline.com/news/186576_susan_sarandon_thinks_her_thelma_louise_character_may_have_become_a_lesbian_if_she_had_lived/ several] [http://s1.zetaboards.com/L_Anon/topic/5185938/1/ discussions] on whether one or both of them are lesbian or not. ''Snakes on a plane'' was previously mentioned in [[107: Snakes on a Plane! 2]], with tornados and weather chasing in [[640: Tornado Hunter]].\n\nIn the title text, Megan and Blondie notice that the snakes have been {{w|Rain of animals|picked up by the tornado}} they are chasing; so now, in addition to the violent weather, they are also exposed to the danger of snakes falling from the sky.  (This is similar to the plot of {{w|Sharknado (film series)|Sharknado}}, although that movie was released several years after this comic.) \n\nThis is the third comic about tornadoes and storm chasers, a [[:Category:Tornadoes|recurring subject]] on xkcd.  These were first mentioned in [[402: 1,000 Miles North]], and first shown in [[640: Tornado Hunter]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Blondie, with extra long hair and Megan in the background of the image observes a long snake on the ground in the foreground.]\n:Blondie: Whoa, a snake!\n:Megan: Cool!\n:Blondie: I'm afraid of snakes.\n\n:[Zoom in only on Megan's upper half.]\n:Megan: I'm afraid of saying \"everything's complicated right now, but maybe next year\" until there are no more years left.\n\n:[Slim panel with a zoom to a full picture of only Blondie as she considers this.
