He depicts [[Cueball]] apparently puzzling over the meaning of one such initialism.\n\n\"SMFW\", the title of the comic and an initialism used as the caption, is very close to a number of other common initialisms, including:\n\n*\"MFW\", meaning \"my face when...\" used in similar sentence constructions to this comic's caption, to indicate that the image represents one's face when the specified thing happens.\n*\"SFW\", meaning \"safe/suitable for work\", denoting that something does not have suggestive content.\n*\"SMH\", meaning \"shaking my head\" or \"so much hate\", used to indicate dismay.\n*\"SMF\", meaning \"so much fun\".\n*\"NSFW\", meaning \"not safe for work\", the opposite of \"SFW\".\n\nThe title text contains more examples of imaginary initialisms of a similar nature:\n\n*\"WTFW\" is a combination of \"WTF\" (\"What the fuck\") and \"TFW\" (\"That feel when...\" or \"That face when...\", used in a similar nature to \"MFW\"), and possibly \"FTW\" (\"For The Win\") and \"FWIW\" (\"For What It's Worth\").\n*\"SMHO\" is a combination of \"SMH\" (\"shake my head\") and \"IMHO\" ([[1989:_IMHO|\"In my humble/honest opinion...\"]]).\n*\"TBFH\" is a combination of \"TBF\" (\"to be fair\") and \"TBH\" (\"to be honest\").\n*\"IMDB\" is, of course, [http://www.imdb.com/ the Internet Movie Database], but also resembles \"IMHO\".\n\nBelow are possible examples of potential (already existing, albeit rare) representations for each initialism, according to the {{w|Urban Dictionary}}:\n\n*[http://www.urbandictionary.com/SMFW SMFW] is listed as an initialism for \"Smoke more fucking weed\".\n*[http://www.urbandictionary.com/WTFW WTFW] is listed as an initialism for \"What the fuck, what?\".\n*[http://www.urbandictionary.com/SMHO SMHO] is listed as an initialism for \"Shaking my head off\".\n*[http://www.urbandictionary.com/TBFH TBFH] is listed as an initialism for \"To be fucking honest\".\n\nKnowing Randall, the sentences given in the comic proper and title text were probably made without an actual meaning in mind. Nevertheless, the sentence in the comic has a very plausible interpretation: \"So Much Frustration When an acronym ''almost'' makes sense.\" Other plausible interpretations of the initialism could be \"So Much Fun When\" or \"See My Face When\". Even the absurdly cryptic title text has a plausible translation: \"What The Fuck, World? (WTFW) it's like Some Moron's Horrible Opinion (SMHO) To Be Fucking Honest (TBFH), I'm Done, Bye. (IMDB)\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a desk, crouched over a laptop.]\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:SMFW an acronym ''almost'' makes sense\n\n==Trivia==\n\nThe name of the comic ''[[xkcd]]'' is itself a false initialism &ndash; from the [http://www.xkcd.com/about xkcd about page]:\n:''\"It's not actually an acronym. It's just a word with no phonetic pronunciation -- a treasured and carefully-guarded point in the space of four-character strings.\"''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
