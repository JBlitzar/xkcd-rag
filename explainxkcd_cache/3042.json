[[Randall]] claims that the ancestors of ''T. rex'' had (relatively) longer forelimbs, and hypothesizes that — had non-avian dinosaurs not suffered an {{w|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction event}} — this trend of \"reduced limbs\" would have continued until present-day descendants of ''T. rex'' were limbless creatures not unlike a giant snake.\n\n{{w|Evolution|Evolutionary theory}} indicates that different selection pressures cause the development or loss of characteristics, as those characteristics which enable better survival to continuation of the species are emphasized and those which don't (such as wasting nutrients on growing unnecessary limbs) are not.\n\nIn reality, while some animals have evolved to lose the use of the limbs of their predecessors — such as the hind legs of a whale — there is no particular reason to think that the ''T. rex'' was on the way to its forelimbs becoming vestigial, as opposed to being well adapted to the niche it filled in the form they had. In fact they appear to have been extremely powerful, which would be an unusually wasteful trait if they were not much used. There is even less reason why the shrinking of one set of limbs would necessarily apply to other limbs. A ''T. rex'' would continue to have substantial need for its hind legs, which it used for running and chasing prey, and would have no reason to lose legs unless environmental factors favored a limbless lifestyle. Loss of all limbs has happened multiple times in the order {{w|Squamata}} (the lizards and snakes), where limbless body plans have evolved convergently over and over, such as in {{w|Common_slow_worm|blindworms}} as compared to true {{w|snake}}s. However, the circumstances that encourage such lifestyles were not likely to happen to the large predatorial Tyrannosaurus. With that said, it is not outright impossible that Tyrannosaurus could have eventually lost its arms if it had never gone extinct.\n\nThe title text make a similar claim that, as ''T. rex'' was also larger than its ancestors, the same trend in growth would continue, such that the hypothetical limbless present-day descendant would be even larger than the {{what if|78|famously elephant-sized}} ''T. rex''. In reality animals do not change in size linearly over time, and a modern descendant of Tyrannosaurus would not necessarily be dramatically larger and could easily have become somewhat smaller, even with the same body plans and lifestyle. Though it is unlikely that the constraints of {{w|insular dwarfism}} could have applied to such creatures across the continental range they may have remained alive to inhabit, many unknown factors might have influenced their descendants' body shapes, and probably even induced further speciation to render all surviving branches of the tyrannosaur family tree as distinct, probably to include both growing and re-shrinking lineages. (It is a common misconception, used here for humorous purposes, that an individual personally evolves into a particular form, or that a single descendant represents the only evolutionary track taken 'towards perfection' from a less evolved ancestor.)\n\nThe ''T. rex'' was also referenced in the ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article ''{{what if|78|T-rex Calories}}''. This comic may be tangentially related to the fact that birds are dinosaurs that survived the KT extinction, which is a recurring theme on xkcd. Extrapolation and interpolation, often absurd, are [[:Category:Extrapolation|recurrent topics]] on xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph is shown.
