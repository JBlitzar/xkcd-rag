Chests are \"Items\" (small and often humorous images) which could be collected from other comics, and then placed in this image by viewers, but today they are no longer dropped. The collection then updated for all viewers in real-time. Multiples of the same item are often seen. There is a \"backpack\" at the bottom, similar to backpacks in video games containing items collected by the player. As hinted by the title text, items could be found by visiting different xkcd comics/pages. Randomly, some pages would have a treasure chest which contained the sticker related to the page. The hint would refer to the page which currently had a chest.\n\nThe comic contains 32993 separate images. The sticker images can be seen at xkcd.com/2288/collectors/static/loot/loot_'''XXX'''.png, where XXX is a number from 001 to 253. Additionally, some images can be found at custom URLs, for example the periodic elements can be found at <nowiki>h</nowiki>ttps://xkcd.com/2288/collectors/static/loot/element-'''XX'''.png, where XX is the element, and text loot at xkcd.com/2288/collectors/static/loot/loot-words-'''X'''.png, where X is the sentence. The [https://github.com/xkcd/maple source code] for the comic was released on GitHub.\n\nPlacement is limited to 10,000 horizontal units and 5,000 vertical units from the origin. Users received no messages if they try placing something outside the boundary, with a silent fail and the object not being placed. The coordinates are relative to the bottom left corner of the canvas. As the default coordinates are (-370,-277) and the origin is in the center, the displayed portion of the canvas can be found to be twice this in magnitude, 740 x 544 units. The most common image is loot-30.png, which appears 2576 times.\n\n[[File:2288_full.png|100000px|thumb|left|The full image]]{{clear}}\n\n=== Hints ===\nFor a more minimal list of the stickers found in the comic, see [[2288: Collector's Edition/Stickers]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Sticker\n!Hint\n!Comic\n!Item unlocked\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[File:2288_loot_019.png|50px]]\n|Doctors in a row\n|[[239: Blagofaire]]\n|Cory Doctorow\n|These comics all have the same hint, but only one will have the chest\n|-\n|[[File:2288_loot_246.png|75px]]\n|Get out the (US) vote\n|Chapter 5 of What If?
