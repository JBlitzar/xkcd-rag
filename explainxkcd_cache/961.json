He was the {{w|CEO}} and one of the founders of {{w|Apple, Inc}}. He was the head of Apple for the introduction of {{w|OS X}}, the default operating system used on all modern {{w|Macintosh}} computers. In {{w|OS X}} when there is a significant slowdown, the Cursor becomes the symbol seen in the comic. It may appear when an application is not responding, or if the computer is busy. This symbol is infamous among {{w|OS X}} users, and is nicknamed \"the beachball of death\". It appears during a lag, and can take a very long time to disappear, thus seeming endless. The title and rotating cursor above a fixture in the ground seems to be referencing the {{w|John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame}}, suggesting that the rotating cursor above the fixture is, in fact, a monument to Steve Jobs. A similar [[:Category:Tribute|tribute comic]] was also dedicated to {{w|Terry Pratchett}}, the day after he died, in [[1498: Terry Pratchett]], to {{w|Gary Gygax}}, three days after he died, in [[393: Ultimate Game]], and to {{w|John Horton Conway}}, two days after he died, in [[2293: RIP John Conway]].\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that when an application is not responding on the Mac, the application sometimes recovers and the system comes back; other times, however, the damage is irrevocable, a {{w|Kernel Panic}} happens and the system needs a restart.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two people before a memorial with an eternally spinning wait cursor. They contemplate silently on an influential life. Goodbye, Steve.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was [[:Category:Thursday comics|released on a Thursday]], the day after Steve Jobs died.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics with animation]]\n[[Category:Tribute]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Steve Jobs]]\n[[Category:Cancer]]\n[[Category:Dynamic comics]]"
