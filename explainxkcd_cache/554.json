This may be because these companies have little programming work until something breaks or needs upgrading, or perhaps they are between projects, or simply waiting for a go-ahead.  Coders still need to make themselves available to perform emergency fixes, but they may have no other assigned work. This requires them to find constructive ways to spend their time. Or unconstructive, if that is more fun.\n\n{{w|Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak}} is a keyboard layout that was proposed in 1936 as an alternative to the existing, entrenched {{w|Qwerty keyboard|QWERTY}} layout, developed in the 1870s. The QWERTY keyboard is the standard in the US, but its key layout was not designed for (or against) speed, instead evolving organically over time to bend to the needs of Morse code receivers, to evade patents and to solve commonly encountered mechanical issues, while the DVORAK keyboard layout was made with typing efficiency in mind.\n\nThe Dvorak keyboard was ultimately unsuccessful. It persists today, but has never threatened the dominance of the QWERTY keyboard. Even if the Dvorak layout is more efficient (which is still a matter of debate, see the uncomfortable truth in [[561: Well]]), QWERTY was and is the standard. This means that every keyboard user has to learn QWERTY anyway, and there is insufficient benefit in spending the time to learn a new layout, especially when you would have to switch back and forth between Dvorak and QWERTY as the situation demands.\n\nTherefore, even seriously considering the switch is a sign that you have nothing better to do. Another joke is that even though the coder has plenty of spare time on his hands to practice on Dvorak, he has only been able to 'almost' match his old typing speed.\n\nThis was the first comic to refer to Dvorak, but since then it has become a [[:Category: Dvorak|recurrent theme]] on xkcd. A later comic, [[1445: Efficiency]], mentions, in the title text, how you could waste lots of time testing to see if Dvorak is faster.\n\n{{w|Gopher (protocol)|Gopher}} is a defunct internet protocol, which has been completely superseded by {{w|HTTP}}. It's a perfect example of the kind of thing a programmer might implement in the absence of other, more useful work. (As an aside, the protocol is named for {{w|Goldy Gopher}}, the mascot of the {{w|University of Minnesota}}, where it was developed. But, for the sake of most people who used it across the larger pre-web internet, it may have mostly evoked the essence of the term \"{{w|gofer}}\"/to ''go for'' something.)\n\n{{w|HTML}} and {{w|XHTML}} are markup languages used to describe web documents. XHTML-strict is a more restricted version of HTML that excludes certain redundant tags like <nowiki><center></nowiki>, which is theoretically no longer necessary now that <nowiki><div> and <span></nowiki> exist. {{w|Haiku}}, on the other hand, is a kind of Japanese poetry. Rather than having a rhyming meter like Western poetry, Japanese poetry has restrictions on {{w|syllable}} count; a haiku must contain three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively. (Strictly speaking, Japanese haiku counts {{w|Mora (linguistics)#Japanese|morae}}, not syllables, but they're roughly analogous.) The section of code given is HTML markup, and would be read by a web developer like this:\n\n:Div class equals Main\n:Span ID equals Marquee\n:Blog! end span end div (or slash span slash div)\n\nWhich can be [https://www.syllablecount.com/ divided in syllables] like this:\n\n:Div - class - e - quals - Main\n:Span - I - D - e - quals - Mar - quee\n:Blog! - end - span - end - div\n\nThis meets the syllable requirements. Restricting yourself to writing markup in this form would be extremely challenging, time-consuming and pointless, so it, too, is a good sign that coders need more real work to do. The title text notes that if you are one of those assholes that are pronouncing the angle brackets, then it would be even harder to write HTML in Haiku format. \"Left angle bracket\" and \"right angle bracket\" take up five syllables each on their own. (The asshole part is Randall's opinion about those who do pronounce <>). Haiku was mentioned later in [[622: Haiku Proof]].\n\nFinally, the last panel mentions the biggest timesink of them all: {{tvtropes|ArchiveBinge|webcomics}}! [This is probably self-referential.] (Or, even worse, [[Main Page|wikis devoted to explaining the jokes in CERTAIN webcomics]].)\n\n==Trivia==\nA haiku-compliant programming language does in fact exist: David Morgan-Mar (a creator of many esoteric and parodic languages) invented [https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/haifu.html Haifu], a language that will only compile if it is arranged into subsets of 5 + 7 + 5 syllables. Unlike the HTML example in the comic, Haifu derives its functions and syntax from concepts in {{w|Eastern philosophy}} (such as naming its variable types after the {{w|five elements}}, replacing true and false with {{w|yin and yang}}, and defining arithmetic in terms of creation and destruction).\n\nThe webcomic referred to in the last panel is most likely Xkcd (setting up a Deadpool-like scenario?)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Above the first two panels there is a caption:]\n:Signs your coders don't have enough work to do:\n\n:[Cueball sitting in an office chair at his workstation, with Ponytail standing behind him.]\n:Cueball: I'm almost up to my old typing speed in Dvorak\n\n:[Cueball is standing next to a server rack pointing at it while looking the other way at a Cueball-like guy.
