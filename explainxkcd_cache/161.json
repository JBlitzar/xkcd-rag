One might be ready to push the right button when a right arrow comes up on screen. One might learn the tricky sequences of moves needed for a situation in the game, and find oneself doing them in another game in a similar situation. Or, as in this case, one might get used to pushing a giant ball around trying to collect smaller objects, and try doing so with your car when the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMH49ieL4es game's theme song] starts playing. \n\nIn the game {{w|Katamari Damacy}}, the player has to grow a large ball of clutter by rolling the ball over smaller objects in the playfield, which become attached to the ball, growing the clutter ball larger and larger. As the clutter ball gets larger, bigger things in the environment will begin sticking to the clutter ball instead of acting as obstacles, giving the player more clutter to grab. How big the player can get this clutter ball, or \"katamari,\" determines how well the player does in the game, as is also mentioned in [[83: Katamari]].\n\nWhen Katamari Damacy's theme song comes on in the third panel, [[Cueball]] begins acting out the game's premise, and drives his car into [[Megan]]'s<ref>According to [https://xkcd.com/161/info.0.json this comic's official transcript].</ref> mailbox - which \"looked smaller\" than his car - trying to get it to attach. This doesn't work so well outside of the game.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text implies that music used in the game {{w|Guitar Hero}} is equally hazardous when driving. Anyone who's become accustomed to rocking out on a fake guitar to a particular song could find themselves involuntarily playing the air guitar when said song comes on the radio unexpectedly. Randall is pointing out that Guitar Hero-induced spontaneous air guitar performances are not safe activities while driving. Alternatively, one may try to hit all incoming objects in an attempt to mimic hitting strings of notes as they move down the fretboard, which would be immediately more disastrous. Another possibility is that the hazard is pressing several buttons repeatedly to mimic Guitar Hero, which would not only distract from driving, but also cause chaos in the car.\n\nThe theme song from Katamari Damacy is also mentioned in [[851: Na]], and game-related pattern recognition is brought up again in [[1344: Digits]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball driving in a car while listening to some music.]\n:Music: ♫ ♩ ♬\n:[Another panel of Cueball listening to music while driving.
