Also on this day he released the first ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' in over three months, and it was called ''{{what if|137|New Horizons}}''. Luckily it did not end up back on Earth, as depicted in [[1532: New Horizons]], released 1½ month before closest approach.\n\n[[Randall]] has taken one of the probe's images of Pluto, and outlined humorous examples of {{w|pareidolia}} on top of it.\n\nIt can be compared to preliminary descriptions by geologists, e.g. [http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/07140911-new-horizons-best-look-at.html?referrer=http://t.co/ExQJ6cKS1Q New Horizons' best look at Pluto before close approach|The Planetary Society]<!-- don't know how this link is supposed to look, someone decide what to do with the pipe-symbol-->.\n\nThe comic probably winks at {{w|Percival Lowell}} whose observatory photographed Pluto in 1915 \"known\" as Planet X. Unfortunately Percival Lowell is most famous for his drawings of the {{w|Martian canal|Canals on Mars}} which are widely misunderstood as channels based on wrong translations from Italian to other languages.\n\nThe title text refers to the debate as to whether Pluto should be classified as a full or dwarf planet. This debate was particularly brought into the public eye and came to be seen as a matter of controversy, following the 2006 {{w|IAU definition of planet}}. The text may imagine that this debate winds on, with definitions being created and revised until a ridiculous state is reached whereby Pluto has a special class of celestial body named after it called a 'Pluto' but fails to fulfill the arbitrary criteria set up for it, and hence is called a 'dwarf Pluto'. There actually exist the terms {{w|Plutoid}} and {{w|Plutino}}, that relate directly to groups that Pluto belongs to, but see those pages for details of their use and usage. There has been a real naming conflict whilst generating those two categories, where Plutons was the name chosen initially, whereas Pluton is the usual name of Pluto in some languages.\n\n===Details on Randall's discoveries===\n\n;Candy shell\nThis suggests Pluto is a confection, like [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Minmus Minmus]. It may also be a reference to the {{w|Mars (chocolate bar%)|Mars}} candy bar.\n\n;JPEG plumes\nThe {{w|JPEG}} image format has the common issue of slightly distorting an image with {{w|Compression artifact}}s. The artifacts shown here do not appear in the official version of this image, but all data sent from New Horizons is compressed and artifacts are common — the full resolution images will be submitted to Earth over the next 16 months. There have been tweets about people seeing plumes associated with active volcanoes and the like, which were explained as being artifacts.\n\n;Frontal bone\nInterpreting Pluto as a head, the {{w|frontal bone}} could be the light-colored region next to the darker top, just above the north pole facing to us.  \n\n;Grease stains\nThe area above Pluto's north pole is attributed to grease.\n\n;Bugs\nCould refer to possible extraterrestrial life on Pluto in the form of {{w|insects}}, or \"bugs\". In the animated TV series ''Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles'', an adaptation of Robert Heinlein's novel ''Starship Troopers'', the first battles with the alien \"Bugs\" took place on Pluto. Maybe it also refers to a software bug at the probe.\n\n;Bullet holes\nA string of small round features which Randall suggests was the result of Pluto getting shot repeatedly, probably by meteorites.\n\n;New Netherlands\nReference to the what if?, ''{{what if|54|Drain the Oceans: Part II}}'', about draining the Earth's oceans onto Mars. In the previous what if?, ''{{what if|53|Drain the Oceans}}'', the Netherlands took over the Earth once their problem with the risk of flooding disappeared. And then they continued to issue forth from the portal that drained the oceans on Earth pouring them onto Mars, to claim Mars as New Netherlands. Presumably, something similar happened on Pluto. This was already again references in both an entry in the table and in the title text of [[1555: Exoplanet Names 2]].\n\n;Disputed territory\nSince the base photograph is identified as \"today's ''New Horizons'' image,\" this indicates that a section of Pluto has immediately become the subject of some controversy, possibly a territorial claim or one of several references to the fact that Pluto was demoted from full planet status in 2006.\n\n;Snake pit\nA snake pit is, in a literal sense, a hole filled with snakes. In idiomatic speech, \"snake pits\" are places of horror, torture and death in European legends and fairy tales. It is also a generic map hazard.\n\n;Full text of {{w|Pareidolia|the Wikipedia article}} on pareidolia\nPareidolia is the human brain's tendency to see patterns where they don't exist. While probably a reference to Pluto's heart, the joke is also recursive: You'd be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article explaining to you that you couldn't actually be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article.\n\n;Tadpole\nA tadpole is the larval stage in the biological life cycle of an amphibian. Most tadpoles are fully aquatic, so they unfortunately do not live on Pluto.{{Citation needed}} It is one of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.\n\n;Kuiper Belt loops\nThe {{w|Kuiper belt}} is a region in our solar system that contains an unknown amount of icy bodies, one known is Pluto. Randall jokingly refers to Kuiper Belt as the same kind of belt that's used to fasten clothing and identifies features on Pluto's surface as loops for the belt.\n\n;Serenity\nAn outline of the ''Firefly''-class spaceship ''Serenity'', which was the titular vessel from the 2002 TV series ''{{w|Firefly (TV series)|Firefly}}''.\n\n;Dinosaur\nNobody can see a dinosaur unless Randall did this painting on Pluto's surface. And any complex comic that is at least acceptable needs at least one dinosaur.{{Citation needed}}\n\n;The good part\nA section of Pluto that is objectively better than the rest. (According to Randall). Whether or not this is really 'the good part' or '[[2984: Asteroid News|just a boring dot like all the others]]' is not known.{{Citation needed}}\n\n;Moon bud\nThis could be interpreted as a moon growing/emerging out of Pluto, as a bud is \"a compact knob-like growth\". A round growth is seen at the location marked, resembling a small, emerging moon.\n\n;Ghost\nA reference to the classic video game ''{{w|Pacman}}'', wherein the primary antagonists are one of four Ghosts. The Ghost on Pluto appears to have a mouth, however, unlike most depictions of the ''Pacman'' Ghosts. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.\n\n;Pluto dinosaur extinction crater\nSuggests Pluto had dinosaurs and lost them the same way Earth did.\n\n;{{w|The Heart (Pluto)|Heart}}\nThe Tombaugh Regio: the most prominent pareidolic feature Randall has outlined, and the only one (currently) also informally named as such by NASA.\n\n;Coronary artery disease\nAlso known as {{w|ischemic heart disease}}, which causes degradation of heart tissue.  The region identified in the comic looks less 'healthy' (is darker and more ragged) compared to the rest of the 'Heart', which Randall suggests is caused by the disease. Real-life coronary artery disease does cause raggedness and fading colour.\n\n;Mount Mons\nReferring to the general practice of naming extraterrestrial mountains {{w|Mons (planetary nomenclature)|\"X Mons\"}} (e.g. {{w|Olympus Mons}}, a mountain on Mars and the largest mountain in the Solar System), as well as naming terrestrial mountains \"Mount X\". Since \"mons\" is Latin for \"mountain\", the feature's suggested name translates as \"Mount Mountain\".\n\n;Charging socket\nA terrain feature suitable for connecting an outside source of electricity for the benefit of implied internal batteries. Compare \"dock connector,\" below.\n\n;Cracks (beginning to hatch)\nImplying that Pluto is some manner of a giant egg. Possibly a reference to the ''{{w|Doctor Who}}'' episode ''{{w|Kill the Moon}}'', in which the Moon is revealed to be an egg from which a monster is hatching. Doctor Who is [[:Category:Doctor Who|referenced by other comics]]. A 2014 article from ''The Onion'', [http://www.theonion.com/article/moon-finally-hatches-36414 \"Moon Finally Hatches,\"] makes the same joke. Also possibly a reference to ''The Light Fantastic'', a ''{{w|Discworld (world)|Discworld}}'' novel in which similar objects are revealed to be the eggs of the World Turtle. A similar idea appeared in Jack Williamson's 1934 short story \"Born of the Sun\".\n\n;Plug (inflating/deflating)\nInflatable balls often have a \"plug\" or opening to insert a needle to inflate or deflate them.\n\n;Scars from predator attacks\nSince it's all-caps, we can't tell if \"PREDATOR\" is a proper noun, but this is possibly a reference to the movie series ''{{w|Predator (franchise)|Predator}}'', about a race of aliens who hunt other beings for sport. Alternatively, a planetary predator (such as comic book villain {{w|Galactus}}) may have previously scarred Pluto.\n\n;Reset button\nThe structure indicated is a small black dot (at least at this distance this picture was taken). Reset buttons on home electronics are often small buttons or holes used to reset the software of the electronic device. How exactly Pluto could be reset is not known.\n\n;Megaman\nOne of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, this one in the shape of a popular {{w|Mega Man (character)|video game protagonist}}.\n\n;Debate Hole - Where we're putting all the people still arguing about Pluto's planet status\nPluto was reclassified as a {{w|dwarf planet}} rather than a {{w|planet}} following the latter term's controversial {{w|IAU definition of planet|redefinition in 2006}} by the International Astronomical Union.  Arguments about the classification continue to pop up. The same argument is referenced in the title text. The name implies a proposal to put all the people still arguing about it in this hole on Pluto. This proposal further implies that the continued debate is very annoying by 2015, except perhaps to the debaters themselves.\n\n;Area missed during ironing\nThe area indicated is near the {{w|Terminator (solar)|terminator}} and shows some intriguing topographic relief. This might be because areas of cloth that were missed during ironing have much more creases than other areas.\n\n;Probably Benign\nA {{w|neoplasm}} or tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue. Randall is suggesting that the abnormal region near the heart has been evaluated by a doctor and determined to be {{w|Benign tumor|benign}}.\n\n;Chocolate frosting\nSuggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where. This area is the \"dark spot\" at the head of the \"whale\" (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/14/science/space/pluto-flyby.html).  The so-called \"whale's tail\" (http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/find-heart-whale-new-horizons-picture-pluto-n388816), is on the other hemisphere and is not visible in this image, it lies east about 90 degrees from the chocolate frosting/dark spot here.\n\n;Vanilla frosting\nAs above, suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where.\n\n;Border of pride lands\nA reference to the Disney animated feature ''The Lion King.'' In the movie, the Pridelands is the bright and prosperous region ruled by the Lion King while a dark territory beyond its border is controlled by hyenas.\n\n;Hyena country\nA continuation of the ''Lion King'' reference above.\n\n;Dock connector\nFrom the point of view of the photograph, this feature of Pluto is at the planet's \"bottom,\" where iPod dock connectors are. Compare \"charging socket,\" above.\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''PLUTO'''\n:Some of the features already identified in today's ''New Horizons'' image\n\n:[Many marks on the image of Pluto follow:]\n\n:Candy shell\n:Frontal bone\n:Grease stains\n:Bugs\n:JPEG plumes\n:Full text of the wikipedia article on pareidolia\n:Bullet holes\n:New Netherlands\n:Disputed territory\n:Snake pit\n:Tadpole\n:Pluto dinosaur extinction crater\n:Kuiper beltloops\n:Serenity\n:Ghost\n:Dinosaur\n:The good part\n:Moon bud\n:Scars from predator attacks\n:Reset button\n:Megaman\n:Charging socket\n:Cracks (beginning to hatch)\n:Plug (inflating/deflating)\n:Heart\n::Mount Mons\n::Coronary artery disease\n:Debate hole\n::Where we're putting all the people still arguing about Pluto's planet status\n:Chocolate frosting\n:Probably benign\n:Vanilla frosting\n:Dock connector\n:Border of pride lands\n:Hyena country\n:Area missed during ironing\n\n:Image credit: NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI - click for original\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Space probes]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Firefly]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Disney]]\n[[Category:The Lion King]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]"
