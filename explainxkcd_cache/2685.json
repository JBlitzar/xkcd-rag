Partial solar eclipses are fairly frequent (2â€“5 per year), but total eclipses are less frequent (about every 18 months), and most of them will not be in convenient locations for a particular set of people. [[Cueball]] seems to be talking about total eclipses visible in much of North America: {{w|Solar eclipse of April 8, 2024|April 8, 2024}} and {{w|Solar eclipse of August 12, 2045|August 12, 2045}}. (There was also an {{w|annular eclipse}} on October 14, 2023.) Making plans for eclipses is awkward given the uncertainty present for anything else far in the future, such as whether the attendees will have children by then, and whether the technology they are using to keep track of their appointments (Google Calendar in this case) will even still exist over 22 years in the future.\n\n[[Black Hat]] claims he can't make it, as he vaguely and obscurely claims he already knows he has \"a thing\" on August 12, 2045. People do not usually have events scheduled for precise dates that far in the future in their personal calendars and, combined with the fact that Black Hat remembers this date without checking (but also without specifying what he'll be doing then), implies that this could be another of his grand and sinister plans... or he just doesn't want to go.  This might also be a reference to an [https://web.archive.org/web/20150524213007/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/21/us/washington-talk-reagan-and-the-russians-the-joke-s-on-them.html old Soviet joke].\n\nThe title text is someone asking to reschedule a medical appointment to see the eclipse. The eclipse is hard to move because that would require hastening or delaying it by moving the Earth, Moon or Sun, any of which would require vast amounts of energy.\n\nThis was published a year before the next such eclipse in America; so, if you're someone who plans things a year in advance, this serves as a reminder to put it on your calendar.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, a friend also drawn as Cueball, Danish, and Black Hat are standing together. Danish is looking at her phone.]\n:Cueball: ...And then after the one in 2024, there's another on August 12, 2045.\n:Friend: We're in! We can invite our kids, assuming we have any.\n:Danish: I'll create an event. Do you think we'll still be using Google Calendar in 2045?\n:Black Hat: Sorry, I'd love to make it, but I have a thing that day.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:It's weird making plans for eclipses.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Solar eclipses]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Danish]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
