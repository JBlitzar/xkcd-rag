Ha ha ha it's me! Oh, what fun we have.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis strip refers to ''{{w|Jurassic World}}'', the then new ''{{w|Jurassic Park}}'' movie, and the titular theme park. [[White Hat]] explains to [[Megan]] that, in their park, they have genetically engineered a better {{w|Tyrannosaurus}}. Megan doesn't feel that the historic Tyrannosaurus can be improved upon, but White Hat insists they've created an even more terrifying, smarter ''Tyrannosaurus'' for this new park.\n\nWhite Hat refers to ''Tyrannosaurus'' as \"two decades old\", referring to the T-Rex in the original Jurassic Park, and that they improved it by further genetic engineering. Megan comments that she is fairly certain it is older than two decades, suggesting that she is referring to the actual Tyrannosaurus that lived millions of years ago.\n\nIn the final panel, White Hat introduces the \"new\" ''Tyrannosaurus'', who is immediately recognizable as the green ''Tyrannosaurus'' from {{w|Ryan North|Ryan North's}} ''{{w|Dinosaur Comics|Dinosaur}} [http://www.qwantz.com/ Comics]''; specifically, from the last panel of said webcomic - which in turn is from [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/interview-with-ryan-north-creator-of-dinosaur-comics-15523444/ clip art]. Anyone who has read so much as a handful of ''Dinosaur Comics'' will know that its ''Tyrannosaurus'' character \"T-Rex\" is about as far from smart and scary as it is possible for a ''Tyrannosaurus'' to be (see [http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2739 this example] from the day this comic was released).\n\nThe title text is an example of what T-Rex (the character) would say to a couple of humans, and it's a poor joke which would only be funny when it's a talking T-Rex saying it. Despite his goofy mannerisms, he is still a carnivore who attacks (or at least accidentally steps on) humans, as can be seen in panel 3 and 4 of the webcomic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat holding one hand up in front om him and Megan are walking together.]\n:White Hat: In ''Jurassic World'', we've used genetic engineering to create a ''better'' dinosaur.\n:Megan: Tyrannosaurus is the most charismatic animal that ever lived, and you think you'll ''upstage'' it?\n\n:[White Hat now holds both his hands up in front of him as he and Megan walk on.]\n:White Hat: ''Tyrannosaurus'' was cool, but it's two decades old!\n:Megan: I think it's a ''little'' older than that.\n\n:[In this frame-less panel White Hat points up as they continue to walk.]\n:White Hat: We took ''Tyrannosaurus'' and we ''improved'' it. Made it scarier, deadlier, smarter.\n:White Hat: Lookâ€“there it is!\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are dwarfed in the bottom left corner as they stare up at a facsimile of the green T-Rex from ''Dinosaur Comics''. They only reach T-Rex to it's knees.]\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the last panel [[Randall]] forgot to draw White Hat's hat so he looks like [[Cueball]], but from the first panel where White Hat walks with Megan and points up at the Dinosaur, it is clear that it is those two characters that are standing beneath it in this last panel.\n**Note that in the two other comics with T-Rex, Randall put in a small Cueball under the foot of T-Rex in the fourth panel of [[145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics]], and in the T-Rex [http://xkcd.com/1350/#p:f2b12f1e-bbae-11e3-801c-002590d77bdd story line] from [[1350: Lorenz]], he also forgot to drawn [[Hairy|Hairy's]] hair, thus also there including Cueball though like here by mistake...\n** The mistake can be explained that [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFinNxS5KN4 the trailer] for the Jurassic World movie was released a day before this comic so Randall most likely created this comic on a very short notice.\n\n*The entire ''Dinosaur Comics'' was parodied in [[145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics]], where Randall copied the drawings himself, and T-Rex has appeared in one of the story lines in [[1350: Lorenz]] (see this [http://xkcd.com/1350/#p:f2b12f1e-bbae-11e3-801c-002590d77bdd example story line] and the Dinosaur section under [[1350:_Lorenz#Themes|Lorenz themes]]), where the actual images from the first three panels of Ryan's comic are used, just like here where it is the last panel which is used. Later, T-Rex appeared in [[3012: The Future of Orion]].\n\n*Unlike the surrounding comics, this comic does not have a 2x scale version. This is likely because T-Rex already appears at the highest resolution here, though [https://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=4005 a higher-resolution render may exist].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Jurassic Park]]"
