Megan is familiar with these sorts of antics and assumes Black Hat is indicating that the film is so old that the lifespan of emperor penguins is less than the time since the documentary was released. Frustrated, Megan simply acknowledges Black Hat's statement by agreeing that everyone is aging. Black Hat, however, reveals that he is not trying to make her feel old, because the penguins were all alive \"last night\" and all died in one instance since then and thus not from old age, possibly from something that Black Hat directly caused.\n\nHis announcement that he is \"trying to apologize\" creates the obvious inference that he caused the penguins to be killed (either intentionally or by mistake). This gives the situation a much darker tone; especially since Black Hat likely is not truly apologizing, as he is very unapologetic in his [[72: Classhole|\"classhole\"]] tendencies, and just wish to mess even further with Megan.\n\nEmperor penguins actually live about 20 years on average, so presumably, barring any intervention by Black Hat, most of the younger penguins and many of the older penguins in the movie were still alive at the time of release of this comic in 2014, nine years after the documentary was released.\n\nThe title text emphasizes that whatever the penguins' fate, we do get and are getting older.{{Citation needed}} This is presented as a last jab by Black Hat as he departs just to make Megan feel a bit worse. So in the end this comic did try to make the reader feel older.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat walks towards Megan who is sitting in an office chair at a desk working on her laptop.]\n:Black Hat: All the birds from ''March of the Penguins'' are now dead.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel only Megan is shown. She sits back from the laptop taking her hands down on her legs. Black Hat replies from off-panel.]\n:Megan: OK, I ''get'' it. We're all aging.\n:Black Hat (off-panel): What? No.\n\n:[Black Hat is in the frame again holding one hand slightly out towards Megan who has turned around in her office chair and is now facing Black Hat.]\n:Black Hat: I'm not trying to make you feel old. They were alive last night. \n:Black Hat:I'm trying to apologize.\n:Megan: Oh God\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics to make one feel old]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
