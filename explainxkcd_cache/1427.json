My name is Inigo Montoya. You [are the best. The best thing ever]', 'Revenge is a dish best served [by a group of people in my room]', and 'They may take our lives, but they'll never take our [money].'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIt looks like [[Randall]] has been playing with his Apple device after installing the recently released {{w|iOS 8}} update. The comic is referencing the autocomplete function on the iOS virtual keyboard. A comparable feature is also available on other operating systems, like Android. When the phrase, for example, \"Revenge is a dish best served\" is typed, the keyboard will suggest “by” followed by “a” then “group” and so on.\n\nThe top of the comic, where the keyboard is shown, is a reference to the character Sherlock Holmes, a detective who is often attributed the famous line \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" (despite having never said that in the canon). In Randall's typing history, the word \"dear\" is most often followed by \"lord\", \"friend\", or \"friends,\" and thus the phone suggests those words as a likely continuation of the line.\n\nThe title text continues, by showing more actual results from keyboard predictions from other movie quotes.\n\nThe following movies are referenced in the comic and title text:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Movie\n!Character & Situation\n!Full Quote\n!iOS Keyboard Version\n|-\n\n|[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/quotes Scarface (1983)]\n|Scarface is holding an M16, defending his house from Sosa's gunmen, shouting to attackers.\n|\"You wanna fuck with me?
