In it, there is a video tape that causes everyone who watches it to die after seven days. However, the viewer can prevent their death by making a copy of the tape and giving it to someone else.\n\nA young [[Cueball]] watches the tape and prevents his own death by \"copying\" the tape and uploading it to a video-sharing website, presumably {{w|YouTube}}. Cueball not only got one person to watch it, the requirement for escaping death, but 363,104 people, all of whom are most likely going to die in seven days. (For scale, the most-watched video at the time of the comic's publication had 78&nbsp;million views.)\n\n<span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ Rickrolling]</span> is an Internet meme where someone is lured into clicking on a video link of {{w|Rick Astley}} singing \"{{w|Never Gonna Give You Up}}.\" When someone is rickrolled, they usually get very upset. Cueball states in the comic that he uploaded the tape to get revenge on everyone who rickrolled him, though it was obvious that he would likely kill many more people than those who rickrolled him (or those who've rickrolled anyone else).\n\nThe title text refers to the file format used by the YouTube player. Historically, YouTube was famous for having extremely poor quality videos, because their Internet connections were slower and server storage space was expensive. So, all videos were {{w|transcode|transcoded}} into a very low quality {{w|FLV}} (flash video) format.\n\nThe girl shown in the video tape — a major part of The Ring series — is named Samara. Posting the tape on YouTube would result in heavily compressed videos in the FLV format. This, presumably, would reduce the quality of Samara's apparition. The title text also implies that nobody deserves that, although <span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://tinyurl.com/qxmreql rickrolling]</span> is (according to young Cueball) apparently punishable by death.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is speaking to young Cueball sitting in front of a TV with a black background and a white ring.]\n:Ponytail: You watched the tape!?\n:Cueball: Yeah, sorry.\n\n:Ponytail: Now you'll die in seven days!\n:Cueball: It's worse than that.\n\n:[TV is cut from the frame.]\n:Ponytail: ...You didn't.\n:Cueball: Yup.\n\n:[Both are now in front of a computer, Ponytail leaning in.]\n:Ponytail: Great, it's got 363,104 views ''already''.\n:Cueball: They kept Rickrolling me! \n:Cueball: It was only fair.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Rickrolling]]"
