This comic spoofs an \"identification guide\" of bird silhouettes, each with the {{w|fuselage}} of an aircraft and the wings of the flying animal from which the aircraft gets its name. All are birds with the exception of the {{w|hornet|hornet}} which is an insect, see the [[#Table|table]] below for individual explanations. This idea of having feathered wings on a plane is absurd, as bird wings (for birds that can fly) are made to support the lightweight structure of a bird. Supporting the metal parts of a plane along with its human pilot would be impossible.{{Citation needed}}\n\nGeneral military training often includes aircraft identification. {{w|Aircraft_recognition|Silhouette charts}} are given to ground observers for memorization and reference so that friend or foe can be determined in the field. Conversely, many bird watching books will carry pictures of avian silhouettes from below, as often key details like tail and wing shape are the easiest way to determine the species of a high soaring bird, especially birds of prey. (Two comics later [[Cueball]] is out birdwatching with his friend in [[1826: Birdwatching]] and could need such a chart, if he could spot any birds that is. A hawk, that is actually a drone, was spotted in [[1910: Sky Spotters]].). The pseudo-confusion between birds and planes here could be a reference to the \"It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman\" quote often used in, naturally, {{w|Superman}}-related entertainment. A similar joke was used in [[1792: Bird/Plane/Superman]]. The comic highlights not only the various designs of aircraft tails, but also bird wings. Some wings are highly adapted for soaring (eagle), speed (falcon), as well as rapid acceleration and short flights (blackbird).\n\nThe title text is juxtaposing military air bases with breeding nests of the animals, both of which might earn a hostile response to approach at the wrong time, but in wildly different measure. Encroaching on breeding territory of some of the birds being referenced may result in getting dived at or chased, so the comparison invites the reader to imagine what might happen if the analogous creatures in the comic were defending their nest with aircraft ordnance. And if the birds were armed, with the missiles normally found on a military aircraft then imagine what would happen... This is also the second comic to refer to the military in less than two months, the first being [[1803: Location Reviews]] reviewing a Nuclear Launch Facility.\n\nThe idea of a bird with plane engines was first used in [[1729: Migrating Geese]], which also shows birds in silhouette. The third last bird in the right arm of the V-formation has twin engines.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Animal\n! style=\"width: 8em\" | Plane\n!Description\n|-\n|{{w|Osprey|Osprey}}\n|{{w|Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey|V-22 Osprey}}\n|The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a raptor with distinctive white and brown coloring. It's also sometimes referred to as a sea hawk or fish eagle due to its virtually all fish diet.\nThe V-22 Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft that has been in development since the 1980s, and was introduced to the U.S. Armed Forces in 2007. It's a troop carrier aircraft that combines the vertical take-off ability of a helicopter with the high cruising speed of an airplane. (''{{w|Bell Helicopter}}'' and {{w|Boeing Rotorcraft Systems|''Boeing''}})<!--Is this a style violation to pipe Boeing Rotorcraft as plain \"Boeing\"?-->\n|-\n|{{w|Hornet|Hornet}}\n|{{w|McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet}}\n|Hornets are a type of wasp of the genera vespa or provespa. They're known to be highly territorial and aggressive.\nThe F-18 Hornet is a fighter developed for the Navy in the 1970s. It's been deployed by air forces around the world in both air-to-air and air-to-ground roles, and is flown by the US Navy demonstration team, the Blue Angels. The airplane is still being produced in an updated and larger version, the {{w|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet}}. (''{{w|McDonnell Douglas}}'')\n|-\n|{{w|Falcon|Falcon}}\n|{{w|General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon}}\n|A falcon is a bird of prey known for its tapered wings that allow for high speed flight and high maneuverability.\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon is a light single-engine fighter. It's flown by the USAF demonstration team, the Thunderbirds. (''{{w|General Dynamics}}'')\n|-\n|{{w|Harrier (bird)|Harrier}}\n|{{w|Harrier_Jump_Jet|AV-8B Harrier}}\n|A harrier is a hawk that hunts by flying low over open ground.\nThe first operational {{w|STOL}}/{{w|VTOL}} fighter. They are known for their use in the {{w|Falklands War}} (1982), where they operated from converted cargo ships as well as aircraft carriers. (''{{w|Hawker Siddeley}}'')\n|-\n|{{w|Eagle|Eagle}}\n|{{w|McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle|F-15 Eagle}}\n|Eagle is a common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae.\nIntroduced in 1976, other jets like the F-16 have filled its role. The U.S. Air National Guard is the largest operator as of now. (''{{w|McDonnell Douglas}}'')\n|-\n|{{w|Kestrel|Kestrel}}\n|{{w|Kestrel_K-350|Kestrel K-350}}\n|A bird of prey that can hover before swooping in on its prey.\nThe Kestrel is a single-engine, proof-of-concept aircraft, similar to the {{w|Pilatus PC-12}}. (''{{w|Kestrel Aircraft}}'')\n|-\n|{{w|Hawk|Hawk}}\n|{{w|BAE_Systems_Hawk|Hawk T1}}\n|A hawk is a large bird of prey with a heavy head and beak. They have very acute vision.\nA trainer aircraft. It is flown by the Royal Air Force display team, the ''{{w|Red Arrows}}''. {{w|T-45 Goshawk}} is the U.S. designation of a variant of this aircraft. The fuselage silhouette is of a BAE Hawk, although other aircraft have also had Hawk-related names, for example the Hawker [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Sea_Hawk Sea Hawk] and the Douglas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk A-4 Skyhawk]. (''{{w|BAE Systems}}'')\n|-\n|{{w|Common blackbird|Blackbird}}\n|{{w|Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird}}\n|There are many birds that go under the {{w|Blackbird#Birds|name blackbird}} but the common blackbird is a species of {{w|true thrush}}.\nA Mach 3+ spy aircraft, known for its speed and engine design (which allowed them to work both as turbines and ramjets). Imagine a bird flying at supersonic speeds, if anything, it would be disastrous at the least.{{Citation needed}} (''{{w|Lockheed Martin}}'')\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A silhouette identification guide chart shows eight silhouettes in two rows. The silhouettes are a combination of the fuselage of an aircraft and the wings of birds, or in the second case an insect.
