The most well-known decrees have led to definitions of ''{{W|Biblical canon|Biblical canon}}'', [Gk: ''κανον''] traditionally referring to the books of the Bible (Old Testament and New Testament) which are generally accepted as being doctrinally sound, worthy of inclusion by church bodies, and proclaimed liturgically. Non-canonical works are known as {{w|apocrypha}} or \"Deuterocanonical\" (works which, while perhaps edifying and ancient, are doctrinally rejected by some or all Christian authorities). The writers of the New Testament and other Church Fathers had adopted the Greek word for a type of straight reed, ''κανε'', because it was being cut and used in the Hellenistic world to apply standards of measurement.\n\nThe term \"canon\" was subsequently applied by analogy to the {{w|Sherlock Holmes}} stories which were written by {{w|Arthur Conan Doyle}}, as opposed to the adaptations into other formats (stage plays, films, etc.) and non-Doyle stories. An early example of this connection was in a 1910 satirical essay by the Catholic scholar Ronald A. Knox, ''Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes''.\n\nFrom there, it took on its modern, even broader meaning for fiction in general: the material widely accepted as created by the recognized author(s). For instance, ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' canon comprises the films and some TV shows made by {{w|Lucasfilm}} (and {{w|Disney}} after its buyout of Lucasfilm), but that canon is supplemented by a large amount of non-canonical {{w|Star Wars in other media|''Star Wars'' content in other media}} such as books, video games, comic books, fan fiction, etc. In addition, what is canon can be changed, as occurred when a large portion of formerly canon Star Wars content was [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends decanonised] in 2014 to make narrative space for the upcoming Star Wars trilogy sequel movies. Determining what is canon and what is not in a narrative framework has a tendency to excite huge passions amongst fans where they decide what is, and what is not, binding to the fandom, drawing comparison to the huge factionalism of religions.\n\nHere, Cueball is using the modern meaning to describe a theological dispute from the 18th century when scholars used ''canon'' in its secondary derived meaning referring to the canon of Scripture. There are many examples of fierce theological disputes that were recorded in pamphlets and books throughout the 16th to 19th century, for example just regarding the correct mode of baptism: {{w|File:The Summe of a conference at Terling in Essex, Januarie 11, 1643 - held between 3 ministers ... opponents pleading for infants baptisme, and 2 catabaptists ... respondents denying .. (IA summeofconferenc00stal).pdf|1644 (683 pages)}}, {{w|File:A defence of infant-baptism in answer to two treatises, and an Appendix to them concerning it, lately published by Mr. Jo. Tombes - wherein that controversie is fully discussed ... (IA defenceofinfantb00mars).pdf|1646 (342 pages)}}, {{w|File:A discourse proving the divine institution of water-baptism - wherein the Quaker-arguments against it are collected and confuted with as much as is needful concerning the Lord's supper (IA discourseproving00lesl).pdf|1697 (150 pages)}}, {{w|File:An essay on infant baptism (microform) - in which the right of infants to the sacrament of baptism, is proved from Scripture, vindicated from the usual objections (IA cihm 89861).pdf|1768 (219 pages)}},  {{w|File:Modern immersion not Scripture baptism (IA modernimmersionn00thorrich).pdf|1831 (400 pages)}}, {{w|File:The heavenly father's teaching (microform) - a pedo-Baptist's reply to immersionists shewing that Baptism is not immersion, and that immersion is not Baptism, for they are direct opposites (IA cihm 08315).pdf|1874 (107 pages)}} - examples selected from hundreds of similar books. Similarly, the word \"fandom\" comes from the word \"fan\", which is the shorter form of \"fanatic\", and '-dom', as in a class of people. Fanatic's etymology, in turn, points to the latin word \"fanaticus\" meaning 'of a temple, inspired by a god'. (The latin word \"fanum\" means 'temple'.)\n\nAn ''Achilles’ heel'' is the weak point of something or someone who is otherwise very strong. It derives from the legend of the great Greek warrior {{w|Achilles}}, who as a baby was dipped into the river {{w|Styx}} by {{w|Thetis|his mother}} to make him invulnerable everywhere on his body that the water touched. However, during the dipping, his mother held him by the heel, which was thus vulnerable because it didn't enter the river, and in fact Achilles later died after he was shot in that heel with an arrow. The joke again is the self-reference.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding a book up in front of him with both hands while talking to White Hat.]\n:Cueball: It's so weird reading these 18th century scholars argue about minor biblical details.\n:Cueball: It's like they're an online fandom or something - they've developed this whole elaborate canon.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:It's fun when a word's usage goes full circle and, by analogy, lands back on its original meaning.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Religion]]"
