Listeners would most likely mistake the sound effects for the real thing, which could cause havoc.\n\nFor comparison, \"{{w|Indiana Wants Me}}\", a 1970 hit single by {{w|R. Dean Taylor}}, had the sound of police sirens removed from later pressings because drivers were reportedly mistaking the sound effects for actual police cars and pulling over.\n\nThis can also be a reference to an unusual anti-piracy method, where P2P and Torrent networks are seeded with altered copies of songs that contain obnoxious sounds at random points.\n\nThe title text refers to the common sensation of having sounds from the real-world incorporated into a dream, especially as one is waking up. This gives a (false) sensation that is the reverse of the dream described in [[557: Students]]. It implies that the author has been dreaming his entire life since his junior year of high school, which is obviously not true.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:<big>How to become the most</big>\n:<big>hat<u>ed band in the wo</u>rld:</big>\n:Record an album that's nothing but brilliant, catchy instant classics guaranteed popularity and airtime,\n:[Cueball is at the steering wheel of a car.]\n:Music: So far from hooome but I can't stoâ€” ''HONK''\n:Cueball: AUGH!
