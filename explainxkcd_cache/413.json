With a diagonal size of 11 inches, it would take a big hamster ball to carry it like this.\n\n{{w|Omniwheel}}s are wheels with rollers mounted on the edge to allow the wheel to slide sideways. The wheels in the drawing look more like {{w|Mecanum wheel}}s, which have rollers mounted at an angle to the edge. Both omniwheels and Mecanum wheels are used in omni-directional drive systems, like you would use to drive a hamster ball from the inside. A {{w|webcam}} is connected magnetically to the top of the hamster ball, which connects to an rf link to transmit wirelessly to the computer.\n\nTCO is {{w|total cost of ownership}}, which is exactly what it sounds like: the purchase price of something, plus all costs of keeping, operating, and/or maintaining that something. It's used in accounting to determine something's true cost-to-value evaluation. In the case of a cat, TCO would primarily consist of food, litter, veterinary care, etc. Refer to [[#Trivia|trivia for more details]]. For the device in the comic, there would be a small ongoing cost (occasional recharges for the batteries) after the initial investment.\n\nA {{w|Roomba}} is a self-directed robotic vacuum cleaner made by iRobot, which has no feelings and cannot make friends.{{Citation needed}}\n\n{{w|Python (programming language)|Python}} is a programming language popular among geeks running Linux. Among other features, it has a large number of easily installed 3rd-party libraries that make it easy to add features (stored in ''modules'') to programs. In this case, [[Cueball]] is importing the (fictional){{Citation needed}} <code>soul</code> module to give the new pet a soul. This is a reference to [[353: Python]], in which Cueball is able to fly by importing the (''then'' fictional) <code>antigravity</code> module.\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|One Laptop per Child}} project spearheaded by Nicholas Negroponte around 2005, with the goal of building an inexpensive, durable sublaptop that could be distributed to children in developing countries to give them an educational edge.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is placing EEE PC inside hamster ball. Cueball scratches his head.]\n:Cueball: What are you doing?\n:Megan: Mounting your EEE PC in a hamster ball.\n\n:Megan: Well, the TCO of a cat is like $1,000/year, so we're saving money.\n\n:[Cueball is typing.]\n:Megan: Microcontrollers are all wired up! How's the brain coming?\n:Cueball: I've taught it obstacle avoidance and blogging.\n\n:Cueball: Aww, look, it's making friends with the Roomba.\n:EEE PC: ''RRRRR''\n:Roomba: ''Beep!''\n\n:[A blueprint in the background shows a webcam, RF links, bearings, omni wheels, magnets, EEE PC, omni wheels, and a battery all hooked up to Megan and Cueball's \"pet.\"]\n\n:[Hamster ball bounces down a flight of stairs.]\n:Hamster ball: ''Bonk bonk''\n:Off-panel: Man, I hope it's okay that we're laughing at this.\n\n:[Megan picks up a ball.]\n:Megan: I think my mothering instinct took a wrong turn somewhere.\n:Cueball: You mean an <u>awesome</u> turn.\n\n:[Cueball is typing.]\n:Megan: Too bad we can't give it a soul.\n:Cueball: Sure we can.\n:Cueball types: import soul\n:Megan: Oh, right. Python.\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to [http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2137&aid=1542 Pet Education's list], the TCO for a cat is between 310 and 1169 USD per year.\n*In January 2020, Samsung named the pet{{Citation needed}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7N5UDZX7TQ \"Ballie\"], while Python support has not been confirmed yet.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Hamster balls]]\n[[Category:Programming]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Roomba]]"
