The {{w|Spider-Man theme song}}, first used for the 1967 cartoon show, includes the words, \"Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can\". However, at other points, the theme song explains some things Spider-Man can do that a real spider obviously couldn't, such as crime-fighting.{{citation needed}} Randall is pointing out that while the abilities attributed to Spider-Man make a good superhero story, they are not real abilities of a spider.\n\nThis comic depicts [[Cueball]] as a far more realistic Spider-Man, behaving and thinking much more closely to a real spider than the Spider-Man from the comics. Cueball is shown {{w|Ballooning (spider)|ballooning}} ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai3gTAwssxQ example]), a trait used by spiders to move between locations, rather than swinging on web cords as in the comics and films. As he is floating, he sees a good spot to land, eat some bugs and make an egg sac. Again this contrasts the real life of a spider with Spider-Man, who would doubtless be rushing to fight crime or save a pretty girl.\n\nOnly female spiders create an egg sac. Male spiders spin a sperm web in order to transfer their sperm from their {{w|epigastric furrow}} into their {{w|pedipalp}}s (reproductive organ located on the front two appendages, in the position where a scorpion would have pincers), which will then be used to transfer the sperm into the female during copulation. Cueball/Spider-Man, being nominally male, should in fact be looking for a place to create a sperm web, not an egg sac. However, thanks to being featured in children's books, the actions of female spiders are much more widely known.\n\nThe title text refers to the mating ritual of some spiders, in which the male performs a dance to court the female. {{w|Mary Jane Watson}} is the third love interest and Peter's eventual wife in the Spider-Man stories, and so Cueball is planning to court her by dancing in front of her. In doing so he hopes that he is lucky, and she doesn't eat him before copulating with him, as {{w|sexual cannibalism}} is a trait associated with spiders.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is shown floating on the wind, attached to a large balloon. The balloon is made of spider silk.]\n:Cueball: Ooh, that looks like a good spot to land, eat some bugs, and make an egg sac!\n:Text under panel: ♫ ''Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can'' ♪\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]"
