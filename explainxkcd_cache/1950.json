The first panel sketches out the prevalence of {{w|Chickenpox|chicken pox}} by age in the {{w|United States}}. <br />\nAs the graph indicates, prior to the introduction of the {{w|Varicella vaccine|varicella vaccine}} in the United States, it was an exceptionally common childhood illness, with almost 100% of the population experiencing it at some point. The illness is highly memorable (since the symptoms last for days and are intensely uncomfortable) and noticeable (since the characteristic blisters are distinctive and difficult to hide), meaning that it was once a common experience that people expected to both experience and see in their peers. <br />\nAs the vaccine became widespread in the US, rates of varicella infection declined dramatically, and new infections are now relatively uncommon. The graph points out that this has led to a fundamental shift in experiences by age. For an American over the age of 30, nearly all your peers growing up would have had chicken pox. For an American under the age of 10, virtually none of them would have had it. This means that older people are likely to think of chicken pox as a normal part of life, while children are likely to have no experience with it, and may not even know what it is. \n\nThe second, seemingly unrelated graph, charts the popularity of certain names over time, in the US. It's normal and expected for certain names to rise and fall in popularity over time, which means that the number of people with those names ends up clustered by age. The names \"Sarah\" and \"Brian\" have gone from being highly popular to relatively uncommon for new babies, meaning that people with those names are much likelier to be older. Names like \"Logan\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Jaxon\" and \"Harper\" went from being virtually unused to having a spurt of popularity, meaning that (as of 2018) people with those names are much more likely to be under the age of 15 than over it.\n\nThe final panel points out that these trends, taken together, generate the interesting effect that you can, in some cases, estimate the odds of someone having had chicken pox, based solely on their first name. Having a name like \"Brian\" or \"Sarah\" raises the odds that you're over 30, which raises the odds that you had chicken pox. People named \"Harper\" or \"Jaxon\" are almost certainly young enough to have grown up with the vaccine in broad use.  These time-based trends predict both the odds of a person having had the illness personally, and the odds that they grew up in a time when infections were common and generally expected. \n\nThe cartoon demonstrates the correlative fallacy, i.e. what can go wrong if one attempts to draw conclusions based on a random comparison of two variables, as described by the famous saying: \"{{rw|Correlation_does_not_imply_causation|Correlation does not imply causation}}\". In this case, there's a real correlation between names and the incidence of a particular disease. A superficial reading could suggest that either certain names make people prone to the disease, or that the disease, in some way, impacts a person's name. The real cause of this correlation is simply that certain trends just happen to coincide, causing them to statistically correlate without either variable having a real causal affect on the other. \n\nThe citations are real articles. The first citation ''DOI:10.15585/mmwr.mm6534a4'' is on the {{w|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control}} (CDC) web site at [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6534a4.htm] and the second citation ''DOI:10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.05.050'' is an article in Vaccine at [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12007761?via%3Dihub]. Both articles describe the effects of the vaccine for varicella which is the virus that causes chicken pox and shingles (also known as herpes zoster).\n\nThe title text states that people with all six of the names in the last panel (and indeed, most people in general) tend to think that it's weird we have teeth after thinking about it for a while, but that people named Trevor don't in an unexplained statistical anomaly. {{w|Human tooth|Teeth}} are a normal and near-universal part of the human anatomy (and that of many other animals). Like many aspects of biology, they're generally taken for granted, but can seem \"weird\" if you think about them too much. Randall has often demonstrated a tendency to over-analyze typical aspects of life until they become troubling. Here, he jokes that people with one particular name don't experience this, for unexplained statistical reasons.  This is, of course, fictional. The joke comes from the fact that, were that claim true, it would be as random and as hard to believe as the real phenomenon that the comic addresses.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The first panel shows graph with only the x-axis labeled and with seven labeled ticks.
