It's a play on the phrase \"started drinking.\" This phrase usually refers to someone becoming an alcoholic (in this case, it would be because of the break-up), but in this case refers to the actual fact that Cueball had just started drinking (likely a glass of water) when Megan started talking to him.\n\nA similar (though less serious) play on the Bel-Air meme was later used in [[1059: Bel-Air]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan walks up to Cueball pouring himself a drink.]\n:Megan: Now, this is a story all about how\n\n:Megan: My life got flipped turned upside down\n\n:Megan: And I'd like to take a minute\n:Megan: Just sit right there\n\n:Megan: I'll tell you how I became uncertain about our relationship. I think you just like having a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who.\n:Megan: I think we should break up.\n\n:The reverse Bel-Air only works once, so make it something unforgettable.\n:[Cut to a dropped glass, the drink spilled on the ground.]\n:Cueball: ...wait, seriously?\n:Megan: Yeah.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]"
