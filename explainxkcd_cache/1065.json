It seems that he is being rewarded by a god, since his reward is inside a box that is floating in a beam of heavenly light. Inside the box is a pair of shoes with five toes - and with these magic shoes, he can outrun {{w|Death (personification)|Death}}.\n \nThis comic refers to a new type of {{w|Minimalist shoe|running shoes}} which have very little actual support with individual areas for each toe (they are supposed to make you feel like you are running barefoot). Specifically, the shoes Cueball takes out of the box look like {{w|Vibram FiveFingers}}. \n\nThe joke in the comic is that the shoes are so strange/creepy, that Cueball is not even sure he would want to live forever if he would have to wear these shoes at all times. {{W|Immortality}} is not worth it.\n\nThe title text is a play on the common phrase \"x is the best thing since sliced bread\". The way that [[Randall]] uses the phrase in the title text humorously implies that these shoes would be almost as good to wear on your feet as two slices of bread. Alternatively, that sliced bread had long maintained superiority in being comfortable footwear before only being surpassed by these new shoes of immortality. However, sliced bread is not very comfortable to wear on your feet.{{Citation needed}}\n\nEarlier in [[977: Map Projections]], it was stated that those who preferred the {{w|Dymaxion map|Dymaxion projection}} would wear shoes with toes. And later in [[1735: Fashion Police and Grammar Police]] it was a different type of shoes that were deemed non-fashionable with the {{w|Crocs}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, holding a sword, looks up to a disembodied voice coming from above, and a box hovers in the air before him.]\n:Voice: For saving my kingdom, I offer you a gift of great power.\n\n:[Cueball's sword is now propped up against the right edge of the panel. The box opens, a glow emanating from within.]\n:Voice: These magic shoes enable the wearer to outrun death itself.\n:Cueball: Thank you. I...\n\n:[A close-up on Cueball as he examines the shoes. They have five toes.]\n:Cueball: Whoa, wait. They have those creepy individual toes.\n\n:[Cueball puts the shoes back in the still-hovering box. The sword cannot be seen.]\n:Voice: But they make you immortal.\n:Cueball: ...I have to think about this.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
