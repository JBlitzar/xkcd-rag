Anyway, back to the sitcom one-liners and the constant flow of spam.\n}}\n==Explanation==\nThe comic takes aim at what is considered by some to be the apparent societal obsession with the {{w|human penis|male sexual organ}} (\"phallocentrism\"), especially in regard to size. In general, depictions of an erect penis (also called {{w|phallus}}) represent male potency.\n\nWhile present in every human civilization, the symbol of the penis is also prominently featured in modern mass media. Many films and television series make use of penis-related jokes. A very common trope is the male obsession with the idea that a larger penis is considered more desirable, and a smaller penis less manly or satisfying to women.\n\nMegan criticizes this obsession by pointing out that most penises are about the same size, and normal variations in size are not worth getting worked up about.\n\nThe title text refers to the excessive advertisement for {{w|Sildenafil|potency pills}} and {{w|penis enlargement}} in {{w|Email spam|spam emails}}. The symbol of the phallus can be regarded by some as omnipresent in modern Western society (but not necessarily in other cultures), with presumably every public toilet sporting at least one badly drawn depiction of a penis.\n\n==Transcript==\n:PENISES:\n:Megan: They are about this big.\n:[Holds her hands close together, about half a foot apart.]\n:Now can we P<u>LEAS</u>E, as a culture, move on?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan‏‎]]\n[[Category:Penis]]"
