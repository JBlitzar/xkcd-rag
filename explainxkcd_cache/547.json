One Cueball asks the others about the \"tertiary Free-electron laser ({{w|Free-electron_laser|F.E.L}}) guidance system\". As this is a fairly technical topic, we would expect a response filled with scientific jargon. The joke is that the other Cueball instead responds in a much simpler manner. He uses simple phrases such as \"smash the right tiny things together\" and \"that would be very bad\".\n\nAs the caption below the comic notes, Cueball (probably [[Randall]]) has spent the previous night reading the {{w|Simple English Wikipedia}}, a [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page simplified version] of {{w|Wikipedia}} intended to be easier to understand, and now he finds himself using similarly simple syntax. For example, the article for a [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator particle accelerator] describes it as \"a machine that makes really tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds.\" This is similar to the simple response given by the responding Cueball. In the actual comic, Cueball was able to effectively communicate the dangers of using a broken F.E.L. using simple syntax similar to the style of the Simple English Wikipedia.\n\nFrom the title text, Randall believes that if people teaching advanced mathematics followed this style, their subject would be more accessible. The implication is that more people would be drawn to studying mathematics and that (naturally) the world would be a better place because of this, ironically most likely true!\n\nThis concept was later revisited in [[722: Computer Problems]], [[1133: Up Goer Five]], [[Thing Explainer]] (probably most notably), [[1322: Winter]], [[1436: Orb Hammer]], [[2163: Chernobyl]], and [[2809: Moon]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three Cueball-like guys stand in front of a sketch. The middle Cueball is the protagonist of the comic and will be called Cueball.]\n:Left Cueball-like guy: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?\n:Cueball: We can't put the broken part in the machine. It wouldn't smash the right tiny things together. Then the machine might break.\n:Cueball: That would be very bad.\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:I spent all night reading simple.wikipedia.org, and now I can't stop talking like this.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Simplified language]]"
