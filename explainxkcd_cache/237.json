They're ''filthy.]]\n\nThis comic refers to the fact that many keyboards, especially desktop keyboards, gather large amounts of crumbs and are rarely cleaned. In the comic, a person (probably [[Black Hat]]) tricks an unsuspecting character into lifting his keyboard up so that all the crumbs fall down onto his face. By tricking the victim into de-focusing, the prankster ensures that the victim will not notice the crumbs coming out of the keyboard until it is too late, perfecting a quality online prank.\n\nThe title text references the toy {{w|Etch A Sketch}}, in which you would draw lines using two knobs and shake the Etch A Sketch upside down to clear the screen. If you shook a gross keyboard upside down over you, you would get filth on you as well.\n\nThe cleanliness (or lack thereof) of keyboards is mentioned in the title text of [[1395: Power Cord]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairy sits at his computer, chatting with another person.]\n:Chat: Wanna see an optical illusion?\n:Chat: Hold your keyboard up in front of you and look at the home row.\n\n:[Hairy holds the keyboard in front of him.]\n:Chat: Now cross your eyes a little so the 'g' and 'h' overlap.\n\n:Chat: Keeping focus, lift the keyboard over your head.\n:[Hairy lifts the keyboard over his head still looking at the keyboard.]\n\n:[Tiny bits of dust and skin particles fall out of the keyboard in Hairy's face.]\n:Hairy: Eww!\n:Chat: Ha ha\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Computers]]"
