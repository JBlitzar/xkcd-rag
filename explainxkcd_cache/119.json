The implication is that motor driven hedge trimmers produce a bad, loud sound; maybe the sound of the band is even worse. Additionally, each member of the band has a haircut that resembles a trimmed hedge.\n\nThe title text suggests that they (or at least the lead guitarist) previously did not know their band's name. As he bemoans his apparent inability to choose a good band name, he probably sees the name 'Hedgeclipper' as the reason why the band has no audience.\n\n==Transcript==\n:It's probably a good thing that I never get to pick band names.\n:[A stage with banner overhead reading: OPENING TONIGHT!
