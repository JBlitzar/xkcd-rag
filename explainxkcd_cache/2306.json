The appearance here of talking viruses was followed by a comic classifying whether viruses are [[Alive Or Not]], and this is at least the second comic featuring pathogens as characters; prior to this was [[2287: Pathogen Resistance]].\n\nMany of the measures humans had undertaken to fight SARS-CoV-2, such as careful hand-washing, sanitizing of frequently-touched surfaces and social distancing, were also effective barriers against the transmission of most pathogens. Hence, one of the ironic potential silver linings of the coronavirus pandemic was that the aggressive implementation of these measures would be simultaneously likely to slow the spread not only of SARS-CoV-2, but of many other common illnesses. If these measures had become long-term social expectations, they may have improved public health long after the current pandemic had passed.\n\nHand-washing with soap is a particularly effective way to disable coronaviruses and influenza viruses, which have a {{w|viral envelope}}.\nMost common colds are caused by a {{w|rhinovirus}}, a non-encapsulated virus that is not as sensitive to soap. Nonetheless, proper and frequent hand-washing appears to reduce the spread of most viruses, by removing biological residue which harbors the virus. Hence, more aggressive hygiene is likely to have at least some impact on most easily transmissible diseases. Handwashing was a major emphasis of anti-COVID measures in mid-2020 when this comic was written, though as more was learned about the disease (in particular its airborne transmission) the focus shifted more towards masking.\n\nIn this strip, [[Randall]] addresses the matter from the point of view of viruses. Specifically, those that cause the {{w|common cold}}, imagining them as sentient entities, with spreading infection as their conscious goal. Much like in their prior appearance, the humor comes from the perspective flip, where health measures intend to protect us are seen by the pathogens as terrifying attacks. In this strip, the cold viruses become aware that more aggressive hygiene measures are putting their own existance at risk, and hope to negotiate with humanity, on the grounds that, unlike SARS-CoV-2, they are rarely fatal. Their hope seems to be that, once the current pandemic is brought under control, humanity will abandon these measures, and allow them to freely spread, once again. \n\nCueball's adamant refusal likely reflects Randall's hope that this pandemic will result in lasting changes, slowing the spread of all diseases, including those which are merely very unpleasant, as opposed to actually fatal. By treating this as a conscious battle, people may be more inclined to be vigilant, and not allow the enemy any opportunity to recover. While colds are unlikely to kill otherwise healthy humans, they still cause symptoms that can be painful, even debilitating, in the short term. Previous strips made reference to the miserable nature of the disease.  In December 2015, Randall released both [[1612: Colds]] and [[1618: Cold Medicine]].\n\nThe ''[[What If? (book)|What If?]]'' book previously dealt with the plausibility of eliminating the common cold through aggressive physical distancing alone. The section in that book concluded that total elimination would be impractical. However, the current situation suggests that minimizing the spread of disease by careful hygiene measures is not unrealistic.\n\nIn the title text, Randall mentions a virus with the name {{w|Human metapneumovirus|metapneumovirus}}. He states that this is easily the common cold virus with the coolest name. But that does not mean it warrants our sympathy (as it is present in up to 40% of colds, and can be deadly in vulnerable populations). And he finishes by stating that \"Colds suck. No mercy.\" So Randall would not be sorry to see the common cold eliminated, or at least substantially contained, by our coronavirus precautions.\n\nIn reality, unfortunately, anti-COVID measures would indeed lapse within a short time, leading to a [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/27/23421344/covid-19-flu-rsv-symptoms-vaccines-2022 resurgence of several diseases], including the common cold, and [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10811157/ various] [https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj.q1348 studies] identified both subsequent increases in non-COVID infections and probable reasons for these rises. On the other hand, the influenza (a.k.a. 'flu') variant {{w|Influenza B virus|B/Yamagata}} has become extremely rare since COVID, possibly as a result of anti-COVID public health measures at the time, and scientists are [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24011320 debating whether it has been eradicated].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three large viruses hang in the air in front of Cueball. The one closest to Cueball looks a bit like the virus causing the corona pandemic, although it is made clear it is not this type of virus. The other two are put together in small circles. The one behind the corona-like virus has 7 small circles, four in a group, one above and two below. The other has three circles. They are not so closely knit together, and may instead represent three smaller viruses rather than one large. The corona type virus addresses Cueball with a starburst above it indicating it speaks the lines above.]\n:Corona-like virus: Hi there! We're the viruses that cause the common cold.\n:Corona-like virus: This handwashing...\n:Corona-like virus: It stops when this is all over, right?\n\n:[Same setting in a slimmer panel.]\n:Corona-like virus: It's just, it's making things really hard for us, too.\n:Corona-like virus: Maybe we could make a deal?\n\n:[Same setting in a frame-less panel. The large virus also speaks as indicated with a starburst above it.]\n:Large virus: We won't kill you!\n:Large virus: We just want to get back in your throat and make you feel gross now and then.\n:Corona-like virus: Show us some mercy?\n\n:[Zoom in on Cueball, beat panel.]\n\n:[In the close-up of Cueball, he lifts his hand up, which has been balled into a fist. He is emphatic in his reply.]\n:Cueball: <big>'''''No.'''''</big>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:COVID-19]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category: Biology]]"
