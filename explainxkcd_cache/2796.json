As this is a \"real estate analysis\", this comic mocks real life \"real estate analyses\" for people who are looking for a new home. Walkability measures the ease of walking as a form of transportation in an area (often related to how urban that area is), and is measured by metrics like the 100-point walk score, with higher numbers representing easier and safer walking. Proximity to commercial shops and eating establishments can likewise be a factor for potential residents looking for a convenient living environment. While no units are provided, proximity can be defined as a number that increases with decreasing distance.\n\nEarth is rated as highly walkable, probably because humans can walk on much of its surface without immediate & continuous existential need for environmental survival gear (so far), and due to the gravity on its surface. Earth also rates high on the \"proximity to shops and restaurants\" scale because its surface hosts all commercial establishments known to humans; most businesses are within a few building stories of the surface, though some \"shops\" on airplanes are up to several kilometers above it.\n\nAll other locations are rated as completely unwalkable, and remote from any shops or restaurants. The next closest body, the Moon, typically around 384,400 km away from Earth, is about five orders of magnitude further from shops and restaurants than anywhere on Earth. (A dozen people have actually walked ''on'' the Moon, [https://sei-engagement.pubpub.org/pub/nmjeoom7/release/8 more or less], but none have actually walked ''to'' the Moon, or to wherever else they may want to go from there.) Venus is 108 million km away while Uranus is 2.9 billion, so all these bodies' clustering near the origin on the proximity scale masks a large difference in accessibility. The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are assessed marginally higher walkability scores than the solid Mercury (where temperatures are extreme, but do briefly pass through the range survivable for humans as the planet rotates); maybe their less-hostile (and, in the case of Ganymede and Titan, physically larger) moons are taken into account here.\n\nBased on Earth's high score on both metrics, Randall makes the claim \"I get why this place is so popular\". Most humans would agree with Earth being preferable (no human is known to have permanently inhabited any celestial body besides Earth[https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot]), but would be more concerned with local differences in livability.\n\nAdditionally, the chart also displays the importance of choosing the right scales and data for data representation, because not only does the chart provide no information at all, as the vast surface of earth is marked at the same point; but it also does not provide sensical data, which can be seen by the chart seeming to show a slightly larger proximity to shops for Mercury and Venus than the Moon, which is just plain absurd.\n\nWalkability scores on websites such as https://www.walkscore.com consider proximity to restaurants, groceries, and shopping (among other factors, such as proximity to parks, schools, and culture and entertainment venues), so it would be fairly unusual for a location to score high on walkability but low on proximity to shops and restaurants, or vice versa. \n\nThe title text comments that Mars did score high on the 'noise levels' and 'scenic views' scores. Generally, lower noise levels help maintain a calm and relaxed lifestyle, and are therefore a desirable quality for real estate. Due to it having a thinner atmosphere and (almost) zero sources of manmade noise, Mars is incredibly quiet (though [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/the-fact-and-fiction-of-martian-dust-storms not entirely silent]). However, this extreme lack of noise may turn out to be detrimental to human wellbeing. Access to scenic areas is also generally seen as a positive when assessing property, and the large, barren scenery of Mars has been abundantly documented by the several rovers sent to its surface, resulting in widespread fascination with its serene landscapes (though the ever-present dust, and the need to deal with it, mars the serenity somewhat). Again, though, the sheer emptiness of the landscape might turn out to be a negative rather than a positive.\n\nIt then states the 'school district' ranking (proximity to a good schooling system, which is also desirable, especially to families) is rather poor on account of there being only one available teacher, which turns out to be the {{w|Perseverance (rover)|Perseverance rover}}. ''Perseverance'' is (at the time of this comic's publication) a still-active Mars rover whose main purpose is to examine minerals from Mars' surface and scan them for signs compatible with ancient life: while it could hypothetically serve as a teacher (using its memory banks as teaching material, for instance), doing so would greatly interfere with its main mission if done regularly. This problem is recognised, in that it is ''mostly''  being too busy with its rock samples, yet it ''can'' apparently spare the occasional weekend tuition slot.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph is shown.
