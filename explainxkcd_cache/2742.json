This time, every major island that is not considered a continent in its own right is relocated into similarly-sized swathes of sea partly enclosed by the outlines of adjacent continents. The caption implies it's Earth's intended \"storage mode\", where everything 'loose' is neatly packed away. A similar comic is found at [[1784: Bad Map Projection: Liquid Resize]].\n\nThe comic thus equates the world to a playroom in which the islands are the equivalent of scattered toys left out after playtime, or an office space where 'polite notices' ask users to replace materials, equipment, etc. in its intended storage, to leave it presentable for the next users. It indicates that the loose islands can be properly stored away in the nooks and crannies of the larger landmasses, possibly so they can be easily located when the next person comes along to play with or use them.\n\nThough much of the apparent strange distortions of relocated islands are probably due to the relative changes in length/area/angle across differing parts of the planar-stretched map of the globe (depending upon the {{w|map projection}} being used<!-- I really want to tie that down specifically, when I have time! -->), Randall is clearly also not averse to distorting the landmasses slightly to fit even the 'immobile' continental masses. He mentions in the title text that he likes to make use of the jutting outcrop of {{w|Scandinavia}} (though misspelled as it was in [[850: World According to Americans]]) by flexing it somewhat like one might do with a spring-clip, thus gripping tightly whatever islands he forces within the gap (in this instance, the British Isles and Svalbard). No-one knows what happened to the Baltic islands of Ã–land and Gotland though. Maybe the Irish ate them?\n\nOn 4 March 2023 the last few words of the title text were changed from ''the British Isles'' to ''Britain and Ireland'' (this [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/British_Isles_Euler_Diagram_12.png may or may not] have been strictly necessary).\n\n===Table of islands===\nNew locations of selected islands that are visible on the map:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!
