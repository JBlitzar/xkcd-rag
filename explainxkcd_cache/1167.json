An {{w|Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit war}} is a dispute about a specific edit to an article, manifesting as a series of edits alternating between making and reverting the change, and usually accompanied by a more-or-less heated debate on the talk page.\n\nHere, [[Randall]] is referring to a dispute on the Wikipedia article about ''{{w|Star Trek Into Darkness|Star Trek I(i)nto Darkness}}'' (an upcoming {{w|Star Trek}} film at the time of the comic's posting). On the day before the comic was published, the article name had a lowercase \"into\", and the talk page looked [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Star_Trek_Into_Darkness&oldid=535542349 like this] (rounded off in a friendly way, with the posting of {{w|User:Frungi/Star Trek Into Darkness capitalization|a summary of the arguments}}, and an exchange of virtual hugs). In summary, the debate centers around whether \"I(i)nto Darkness\" should be treated as a prepositional phrase (as in \"Star Trek[king] I(i)nto Darkness\") or an unpunctuated subtitle (as in \"Star Trek[:] Into Darkness\"), whether compound prepositions like \"into\" should be capitalized in titles, and whether the capitalization of the title in the movie's official promotional material is relevant. The intensity and multiple facets of a debate over one tiny letter is apparently entertaining to Randall.\n\n[[Cueball]] changes the title to \"~*~ StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNeSs ~*~\" so that every other letter is capitalized, and the title as a whole is framed by tildes and asterisks (a common, but childish and ugly{{citation needed}} way of emphasizing titles online). This is a particularly silly compromise wherein the title is so obviously wrong, both sides will actually agree on something (that being how bad the compromise title is).\n\nThe title text indicates Randall's belief that such arguments are perpetual and will always arise. He suggests that the edit to the Wikipedia page will result in a dispute over variants of Cueballs [[:Category:Compromise|\"compromise\"]].  One new alternative has the letter cases switched (or shifted, depending on your perspective), one uses a different set of \"bracketing\" characters (xX_[...]_Xx instead of ~*~[...]~*~), and one uses the original title, but with a lowercase \"L\" instead of a capital \"I\" (which appear similar in many fonts).\n\nAlternating-case text later caught on as [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob an internet meme] in 2017 (four years after this comic strip was published) for representing a mocking tone.\n\n[[Megan|Megan's]] line of \"They should have sent a poet.\" is a quote from the film ''{{w|Contact (1997 American film)|Contact}}''. The quote is also referenced in [[482: Height]].  In the movie, the line was meant to convey that only a poet could adequately capture the beauty seen; here, it indicates that prose is insufficient to capture the ironic beauty of the edit war.\n\nThe old \"favorite edit war\" might be the one referenced in the title text of [[878: Model Rail]] or the one resulting from the addition of the [[739: Malamanteau]] article to Wikipedia\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball staring at computer screen.]\n:Cueball: Oh, ''wow.'' Look at Wikipedia's Talk page for '''''Star Trek Into Darkness.''''' I have a new favorite edit war.\n:Megan (off-panel): Oh?\n\n:Cueball: Forty ''thousand'' words of debate over whether to capitalize \"into\" in the movie's title. Still no consensus.\n:Megan: That's ''magnificent''.\n:Cueball: It's breathtaking.\n:Megan: They should have sent a poet.\n\n:Cueball: Well, I'm making an executive decision. I hope both sides accept this as a fair compromise.\n\n:[A Wikipedia page titled \"''~*~ StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNeSs ~*~''\"]\n\n==Trivia==\nAfter the publication of the comic, the debate continued with full force, complete with {{w|Talk:Star Trek Into Darkness/Archive 5#xkcd Mention|a section of xkcd-inspired suggestions}}. The article itself was soon protected, so that only administrators could edit it. A day later, the title was changed to one including a capital \"Into\" by the administrator {{w|User:Mackensen|Mackensen}}.
