It's also possible that he means that it's so hard to forget them that forgetting anything else is simple in comparison to it.\n\nThere is a similar twist in comics [[71: In the Trees]] and [[1042: Never]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is walking through a wasteland talking to himself.]\n:Cueball: I am alone in this wasteland, a thousand miles from you.\n:Cueball: But I haven't forgotten the feel of your skin, your mischievous smile.\n:Cueball: You'd think a thousand miles would be enough.\n:Cueball: I guess I'll keep walking.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
