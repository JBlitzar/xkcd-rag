Supposedly more {{w|ergonomic}} and comfortable than sitting all day, they can be combined with treadmills or stationary bicycles to enable exercise to be taken while working. [[Cueball]] tells [[Megan]] that standing desks are inferior to his solution, strapping his laptop to a deer. The deer constantly runs away from [[Cueball]], forcing him to chase and get exercise (and probably get kicked if he catches up). Additionally, by mentioning the common line of \"humans weren't meant to sit all day\", he is saying that his deer-based solution is much more similar to the task that humans evolved to do, namely {{w|Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering}}. Humans are in fact one of the few species built for {{w|persistence hunting}}, and are able to chase prey for more than four hours in ideal conditions. This is also why one's legs feel sore when standing for extended periods but not while moving.\n\nThe title text takes this a step further, saying that the deer was surprisingly ergonomic, apart from the kicks â€” which would, presumably, be quite debilitating. The ergonomics could be due to the soft, warm nature of the flesh compared to typical cold, hard tables.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is running after a deer with a laptop strapped to its back, while Megan looks on.]\n:Cueball: Humans aren't built to sit all day. This is much healthier.\n\n:[Caption below the panel]\n:My Hobby: One-upping the standing desk people\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
