I've heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I'd bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] and [[White Hat]] are discussing the positive and negative effects of young people writing on mobile phones in the vernacular of the day, {{w|Short Message Service}} (SMS). SMS messages are one of the primary means of text communication on mobile devices and are typically limited to 160 characters. Due to the limited space available on this and other messaging platforms, and also to decrease the time taken to write a message, {{w|SMS language}} (aka textese) developed as a form of short-hand writing. This involves the abbreviation and deliberate misspelling of words, and the use of acronyms.\n\nNaturally, the use of this style of language has expanded into other areas, including those where brevity is not an issue, and this expansion and evolution of language is a subject of intense debate. The main viewpoints on the subject are:\n*Language is being negatively degraded by the use of text speak\n*The use of text speak is a natural evolution of language\n\nCueball's point is that \"practice makes perfect\". The ability to form good grammar comes from practice through a lot of writing, even when that writing is informal; hence, the SMS generation gets a lot of practice compared to previous generations, who communicated mostly with speech, over the phone, and in person, and may have written only a few letters a year.  To foster talent for a major literary work, we should encourage practice, even when that practice is through informal writing such as SMS.\n\nThis idea has some real scientific background, such as the 2009 investigation [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/026151008X320507/abstract Exploring the relationship between children's knowledge of text message abbreviations and school literacy outcomes]. In this study children 10-12 were asked to compose text messages. The number of textisms was recorded, and a positive correlation was found between use of SMS abbreviations and success at literacy tests. This is then related to David Crystal's concept of \"ludic\" language: the playful use of language as a contribution to language development. That notion is developed here: By playing with textual language, one develops writing skills, just as by playing with balls one can develop sports skills. David Crystal [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HyNVuCxTtW0C&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=plester+wood+puja&source=bl&ots=x1kjFfoNAW&sig=moBSR9GJaQJlVBr_P9nqDJwvoxU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rVwDVK3VBqe60QXM5YHABw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=plester%20wood%20puja&f=false explains]: \"Children could not be good at texting if they had not already developed great literary awareness [...] If you are aware that your texting behavior is different, you must have intuited that there is a standard.\"\n\n{{w|James Joyce}} was a celebrated Irish novelist and poet, and his novel {{w|Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses}} is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature. It was criticized in some quarters for the frequent lack of punctuation and ungrammatical {{w|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness}} narrative mode. In addition to his better-known works, he wrote a number of love letters with extremely explicit content.\n\nIn the title text, Randall wishes to prove Cueball's point by analyzing and comparing bulk volumes of texts (= a {{w|Text corpus|corpus}}) written by children today and 20 years ago. Randall favors the literary ability of today's children for their everyday use of written word over the situation of the past, when children wrote only if forced to do so. The title text's second sentence is particularly long and complex (compared to almost any other title text), which will generally score much higher \"on various objective measures of writing quality\". Randall may be hinting that writing a lot of short title texts, like writing a lot of SMSs, improves your general writing quality - further strengthening Cueball's point. The title text is also 99 words long, probably referencing a 100 word limit.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat and Cueball are walking together, White Hat is holding a newspaper or report.]\n:White Hat: Weird- Another study found that kids who use SMS abbreviations actually score ''higher'' on grammar and spelling tests.\n:Cueball: Why on ''earth'' is that a surprise?\n\n:[Cueball turns to White hat (who is now out side the frame. Inserted in the frame is a panel showing several kids throwing balls.]\n:Cueball: Imagine kids suddenly start playing catch literally ''all the time''. Everywhere they go, they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, and hurl them at trees and signs- Nearly every waking hour of their lives.\n\n:[Cueball talks on while White Hat begins to walk.]\n:Cueball: Do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learned sloppy skills?\n:White Hat: ...So you think someone will become a great writer while ''sexting?''\n\n:[They walk together.]\n:Cueball: Have you ''read'' James Joyce's love letters? The phrases \"My little fuckbird\" and \"Arse full of farts\" appear. If we want to write ''Ulysses'', our generation may not be sexting ''enough''.\n:White Hat: Eww.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/0/01/20140830172245%21writing_skills.png original version of the comic], [[Randall]] misspelled \"su'''r'''prise\" as \"suprise\" in the first panel and also accidentally wrote \"writing\" twice in the title text (\"I'd like to find a corpus of writing '''writing''' from children [...]\"). It was initially conjectured here that the errors may have been deliberately introduced as they are relevant to the subject. However, both of these errors were corrected on the same day the comic was released and are currently not present.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Baseball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Phones]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
