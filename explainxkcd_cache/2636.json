It uses absurd and obscure ways to measure the amount of time until [[Randall]]'s new book [https://xkcd.com/whatif2 ''What if? 2''] is released, with esoteric units and esoteric numbers. See explanation of each day in the [[#Table of the calendar countdown|table below]]. Some concepts that appear multiple times throughout the calendar are:\n\n* '''{{w|SI prefixes}}''', which can be applied to the beginning of a unit's name to multiply or divide the unit by powers of 10 or 1,000. This is standard for units like meters and grams, but is rarely applied to measurements of time other than when a unit of less than one second is needed, most commonly in various fields of science and engineering such as physics and electronics.\n* The '''{{w|Gettysburg Address}}''', a famous speech delivered by U.S. president Abraham Lincoln in 1863, where he began by referring to the signing of the Declaration of Independence taking place \"four score and seven years ago\". A score is a dated term for the number 20, so \"four score and seven\" is equivalent to 87.\n* A '''dog year''' is traditionally considered to be one-seventh the length of a normal human year, since a dog's overall lifespan is roughly one-seventh of a typical human's. The comic applies this to other units of time, such as minutes and months, each of which is also one-seventh the length of the standard unit. The number seven (traditionally a \"lucky number\") is also used in many of the numbers quoted in the calendar.\n* Other comparative durations of time that are not normally or usefully applied to day-length multiples. At the top end, there is the age of the universe, at the other there is {{w|Planck units#Planck time|Planck-time}} – with entire durations of periods of human history and the time needed to watch popular TV/film franchises in-between – most of which require a non-trivial multiplier or divisor to bring them to the necessary scale required. \n* A '''{{w|baker's dozen}}''' is 13, or one more than a normal dozen. Here, the \"baker's\" prefix can be applied to any unit by adding an extra one of its constituent parts, like an extra hour added to a day.\n* '''{{w|Irrational numbers}}''' like {{w|pi}} (3.14159...), {{w|Euler's number}} or ''e'' (2.71828...), the {{w|golden ratio}} (1.61803...), and the {{w|square root of 2}} (1.41421...). These are all interesting numbers because of their mathematical properties, but very impractical to use as arbitrary measurements of time because they have an endless series of non-repeating decimal digits.\n* The teenage dating game '''{{w|Seven minutes in heaven}}'''. \n* Rotational and orbital periods of various bodies in the Solar System.\n* The song {{w|99 Bottles of Beer}} is also used twice in the calendar, as the one after a full week and then for the final day before release.\n\nThe title text refers to the recursive time period on the final day before release, September 12, where the 99 Bottles of Beer song is sung 99 times, but with one less verse every time (so 99 verses the first time, 98 verses the second, 97, 96 ... 2 and 1 the last). If you don't stop when you reach N=0 bottles, the repetition never ends, so that time interval becomes infinite. He then calls it \"The Other Song That Never Ends\", comparing it to ''{{w|The Song That Never Ends}}''. That song is a repetitive children's song, which is specifically intended to go on forever. The difference is that the Beer song has a natural stopping point at 0, while ''The Song That Never Ends'' is [https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiEz97RkZT5AhXpk4sKHRs8C2wQyCl6BAgLEAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dxz6OGVCdov8&usg=AOvVaw2dI8Q_thXRfS6MUtq1NerU completely repetitive].\n\n===Table of the calendar countdown===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Days left !! Date !! Duration specified !! Duration in days !! Explanation\n|-\n| 83 || Jun 22 || π<sup>e</sup> millidecades || 82.03&nbsp;days || π ≈ 3.14159, ''e'' ≈ 2.718, so π<sup>e</sup> is about 22.459. A millidecade is 1/1,000 decade, or 1/100 year, or 3.652425 days. Multiplying these results is 82.03 days.\n|-\n| 82 || Jun 23 || 7 megaseconds || 81.02 days || 7,000,000 seconds. 60*60*24 = 86,400 seconds in a day, so 7,000,000/86,400 ≈ 81.02 days\n|-\n| 81 || Jun 24 || ''e'' lunar months || 80.27 days || A lunar month ≈ 29.53059 days, ''e'' ≈ 2.718, so 29.53059*2.718 ≈ 80.26 days.\n|-\n| 80 || Jun 25 || 60 rotations of Foucault's pendulum in Paris || 79.5 days || {{w|Foucault's pendulum}} demonstrates Earth's revolution, with the one at the latitude of Paris completing a full rotation every 31.8 hours.<!-- no need to give the whole history and operation of Foucault's pendulum here; that's what the Wikipedia link is for --><!-- (60 x 31.8) / 24 hours in a day = 79.5 days, not the 79.67 I found here. Even using the 31.78 value I found is still 79.45 -->\n|-\n| 79 || Jun 26 || 8 milligenerations || 78.89 days || A generation is in general 22-33 years, with a reasonable mid-point of 27; and 8 x 0.001 (milli) x 365.2425 (accounting for leap years) x 27 ≈ 78.89 days\n|-\n| 78 || Jun 27 || 777,777 dog minutes || 77.16 days || A popular myth is that dogs age seven times faster than humans, so one dog minute equals 1/7 human minutes. \n|-\n| 77 || Jun 28 || 7! episodes of ''Jeopardy!'' (skipping ads) || 77+ days || 7! = 7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = 5040. The standard episode of ''Jeopardy!'' is 22-26 minutes, skipping ads. At 22 minutes each the total is 110,880 minutes, or exactly 77 days. The title of ''Jeopardy!'' has an exclamation mark at the end, similar to the factorial notation used. \n|-\n| 76 || Jun 29 || 5,000 repeats of ''99 Bottles of Beer'' || 76.39 days || Each verse of {{w|99 Bottles of Beer}} is \"''N'' bottles of beer on the wall, ''N'' bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, ''N-1'' bottles of beer on the wall.\" The entire song contains 99 verses. Randall apparently sings this rather slowly at around 72 bpm, taking about 13 seconds per verse. It can be done somewhat faster as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FITjBet3dio shown here], where the 99 verses take less than 17.5 minutes for 10.6 second per verse. Then it would only take two months, or 61 days – 15 days too few.\n|-\n| 75 || Jun 30 || 5 baker's fortnights || 75 days || A {{w|baker's dozen}} is a dozen (12) plus one extra item. Randall has generalized this to adding one to any unit. A fortnight is 14 days (or more properly \"{{w|Fortnight|fourteen ''nights''}}\", by its original use), so a baker's fortnight is 15 days. 5x15 is 75 days.\n|-\n| 74 || Jul 1 || √2 dog years || 73.79 days || See day 78 (Jun 27). 1.4142 &times; (365 / 7)\n|-\n| 73 || Jul 2 || π millivics (1/1000th of Queen Victoria's reign) || 72.97 days || {{w|Queen Victoria}} ruled between 20 June 1837 and 22 January 1901 (23,226 days). 3.14159 &times; 23.226\n|-\n| 72 || Jul 3 || 42 drives from NYC to LA (Google Maps estimate) || 71.75 days || According to Google Maps, the drive from New York City to Los Angeles via I-80 W (2789 miles or 4489 km) takes 41 hours.\n|-\n| 71 || Jul 4 || 1,000 viewings of ''Groundhog Day''|| 70.14 days || Using {{w|Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day's}} 101-minute run time. \n|-\n| 70 || Jul 5 || 100,000 minutes || 69.44 days || 1,440 minutes per day\n|-\n| 69 || Jul 6 || 1/10th of Martian year || 68.70 Earth days || Martian sidereal and tropical years both round to 687.0 Earth days\n|-\n| 68 || Jul 7 || 1,234,567 sound-miles || 67.63 days || The speed of sound in air depends on the temperature. 15°C or 59°F gives the value 340 m/s and the travel time of 67.6349058 days.\n|-\n| 67 || Jul 8 || 2<sup>π<sup>e</sup></sup> seconds || 66.74 days || 2^(π^e) = 5,766,073 seconds.

Here a value of 93 minutes is used.\n|-\n| 64 || Jul 11 || 🎵🎶🎵 Five hundred twenty five thousand (base seven) minutes|| 62.88 days || This refers to {{w|radix}}-7 arithmetic: 525,000<sub>7</sub> minutes = 90,552<sub>10</sub> minutes (5 &times; 7^5 + 2 &times; 7^4 + 5 &times; 7^3). Also references the opening and recurring line \"Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes\" from {{w|Seasons of Love}}, a song from the musical {{w|Rent (musical)|''Rent''}}, which is also referenced in [[1047: Approximations]]. \"Base seven\" has the same rhythm as \"six hundred\".\n|-\n| 63 || Jul 12 || 10<sup>50</sup> Planck times || 62.38 days || 10^50 x 5.39 x 10^-44 seconds.

This US \"half-hour\" comedy format contains 22 minutes of content (including the title sequence) and eight minutes of ads. There are only 201 distinct episodes of the US version, so watching 4,000 episodes would require a lot of re-watching. <!-- When you get here, note that the original The Office was on the BBC in the UK and had no ads and thus filled its allocated broadcasting slot, give or take intro/follow-on announcements... Only the US adaptation/remake has ads to be skipped. So, link the 'correct' one (from Randall's POV, at least).

Each day is represented with a large square and there are 12 weeks for a total of 84 days.  The days belonging to a particular month are surrounded by a thicker frame than between days from the same month. The first day of each month plus the very first day has the date given with three letters representing the month and the day number. This is written at the top right corner in a frame. All other days either only have the number for the day in the frame in the corner, or, if there are too much text on the day, no number is written. A single day has the number without the frame around it. The very last day notes what the countdown is for and there are three large stars places around the text, as well as smaller and larger dots, likely representing more stars in the entire field. All other days have text on all white background. The text represents a time that fits the time span from that day until the final day. The calendar begins on a Wednesday, and since the calendar week begins on a Sunday, there are three days missing to the left in the top row, and similarly four days are missing to the right in the bottom row as the last day is a Tuesday. Above the calendar is a large heading with a subheading below:]\n:<big>Countdown to ''What if? 2''</big>\n:(Preorder at xkcd.com/whatif2 to get it at the end of the countdown)\n\n:[The date given, either as written or else mentioned if not written in comic, and then follows the text on that day:]\n:Jun 22\n::π<sup>e</sup> millidecades \n:23\n::7 megaseconds \n:24\n::e lunar months \n:25\n::60 rotations of Foucault's pendulum in Paris \n:26\n::8 milligenerations \n:27\n::777,777 dog minutes \n:28\n::7! episodes of ''Jeopardy!''
