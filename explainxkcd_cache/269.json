With TCMP you can bring back any information you want.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\n[[Cueball]] trained himself to type while asleep, so he could communicate from inside his dreams. He calls this ''Trans-Consciousness Messaging Protocol'', or '''TCMP'''. He succeeds in using this system to send a message from inside his dream, but his friends, [[Megan]] and another Cueball, are disappointed when that first message is a {{w|troll (Internet)|trollish}} \"F1rst p0st!!\", in this case, \"trans-reality trolling\", instead of something constructive.\n\nFirstposting, or [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=thread%20sniping thread sniping], is the practice of posting short messages to brag to others that you found and saw this content first. This practice was far more common at the time this comic was written, when high-traffic and poorly-moderated social media sites tended to display comments in increasing chronological order by default; as such, the oldest comments would be most prominently displayed at the top, while the newest comments would be buried at the bottom. These days, while low-traffic and closely-monitored forums still use this approach, social media sites instead tend to sort comments by rating, so that the most appreciated comments are given the most prominence and trollish comments like the cliche \"F1rst p0st!!\" are buried. See also [[1019: First Post]] and [[1258: First]] and regarding trolling [[493: Actuarial]].\n\n\"Bell & Watson\" refers to {{w|Alexander Graham Bell}} and his assistant {{w|Thomas A. Watson}}. Bell is traditionally credited with inventing the {{w|telephone}}, because he was awarded the patent for it, although {{w|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy|that is still controversial}}. His first phone call was to Watson in another part of their lab.\n\nThe forest Cueball is in may be a reference to the {{w|Narnia (world)|Wood Between the Worlds}} in ''{{w|The Magician's Nephew}}'', the penultimate installment (though chronologically the first) of ''{{w|The Chronicles of Narnia}}'' by {{w|C.S. Lewis}}.\n\nThe name \"TCMP\" is likely to be a portmanteau of TCP ({{w|Transmission Control Protocol}}) and ICMP ({{w|Internet Control Message Protocol}}), which are actual protocols used in computer networking.\n\nThe title text explains how this protocol, if real, would be of great value in dream research, since you then would not have to worry about forgetting the dreams after waking up like as in [[430: Every Damn Morning]]. You can relay the dreams as you experience them.\n\nA possible downside is that in order for this to work, the dream has to be {{w|Lucid dream|lucid}}, where the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming. This type of dream is very fascinating to [[Randall]], as mentioned in the title text of [[203: Hallucinations]]. Because this method could not be used to study regular dreams, some possibilities for studying dreams would be limited.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands with a keyboard next to a bed. The keyboard is connected with a wire to a computer on a desk to the right. He talks to Megan and a Cueball-like friend.]\n:Cueball: Hey, help me test the Trans-Consciousness Messaging Protocol.\n:Friend: What's that?\n:Cueball: I've been training myself to keep my fingers moving slightly as I fall asleep. So I can type from inside dreams.\n\n:[In a frameless panel, Cueball sits with the keyboard on the bed.]\n:Cueball: I'm going to sleep now. My computer will relay my messages to you as I explore the dream world.\n\n:[Cueball stands with the keyboard in a forest with tall trees. The leaves are not visible; they are above the top of the drawing. At the top, there is a frame with text:]\n:In the dream:\n:Cueball (thinking): So strange to think none of this is real. \n:Cueball (thinking): And yet I have this lifeline to the internet back home.\n\n:[Cueball places the keyboard on a stone, bends down, and types.]\n:Cueball (thinking): A chance to speak from one reality to another. \n:Cueball (thinking): I feel like Bell & Watson. I get to write the inaugural TCMP message. \n:Cueball (thinking): Let's see...\n:Keyboard: *Type type type*\n\n:[Megan is at the computer, and the Cueball-like friend behind her looks at his message from the dream. At the top, there is a frame with text:]\n:Outside:\n:Megan: \"F1RST P0ST!!\"?\n:Friend: Great. He's jumped straight to trans-reality trolling.\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Dreams]]"
