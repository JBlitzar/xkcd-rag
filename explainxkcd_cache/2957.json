If you keep reading, you won't get the chance of discovering the joke yourself!}}\nThis crossword may seem extremely difficult, with questions covering a wide variety of trivia, linguistics, mathematics in various forms, alongside wordplay typical of crossword puzzles. But the joke is that every single letter of every single answer is \"A\". The name of this comic, \"A Crossword Puzzle\", is a {{w|double entendre}} which could, in itself, be considered a cryptic clue; the \"A\" can be interpreted both as the indefinite article \"a\" and as an identifier saying that this crossword puzzle is specifically an \"A\" puzzle, due to the answer being all \"A\"s.\n\nThe title text is a play on a \"type A\" personality. The term for someone with a competitive and high-achieving personality is \"Type A\". In the context of the title text, this answer is a hint that the entire puzzle can be completed in a crossword-solving app by typing the letter A repeatedly.\n\n===Across===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: auto\"\n! # !!

For instance, if the plaintext is \"XK\" and the key is \"CD\", the C shifts X 2 forward to become Z, and the D shifts K 3 forward to become N, yielding a ciphertext of \"ZN\". Since the ciphertext and the key are the same in this case, decryption just shifts all the letters back to A, akin to subtracting a number from itself and getting 0. || 10\n|-\n| 16 || 8mm diameter battery || An {{w|AAAA battery}} is a 1.5 V battery that measures 8.3 mm in diameter, 2.2 mm smaller than the more common AAA battery. || 4\n|-\n| 17 || \"Warthog\" attack aircraft || The {{w|A-10 Warthog}} is an attack aircraft.

Following the example of the pattern in the clue, taking the first letter and every third one after (rather than just every third letter) we determine that '''A'''ph'''a'''nt'''a'''si'''a''' gives us the word \"aaaa\". This clue is particularly mean because of how it instructs you to visualize the letters highlighted within the word in order to get the answer. || 4\n|-\n| 19 || An {{w|acrostic}} hidden on the first page of the dictionary || The first page of the dictionary (if you ignore the copyright page and the index) is the list of words starting with A. An acrostic of this page, taking the first letter of each line and arranging them in order, would just be a sequence of As. || 15\n|-\n| 21 || Default paper size in Europe || {{w|A4 paper}} (here written as AAAA) is the default size in Europe. At 210×297 mm, it is approximately 0.24″ narrower and 0.71″ longer than the 8.5″×11″ paper used in the United States, and due to having an aspect ratio of 1:sqrt(2), can be cut or folded in half to create two half-sized sheets (A5) with exactly the same aspect ratio. A4 is, itself, also a halving of A3 and of identical ratio, as is the case with all A-sizes higher and lower in the sequence up to A0, which has an area of exactly 1 square meter.|| 4\n|-\n| 22 || First four unary strings || A unary number system represents numbers using just one symbol. For example, 7 in unary would be 1111111. The first four strings in unary, if you used A as the first (and only) symbol, would be A, AA, AAA, AAAA. || 10\n|-\n| 23 || Lysine codon || {{w|Lysine}} is an amino acid, with codons AAA and AAG. || 3\n|-\n| 24 || 40 CFR Part 63 subpart concerning asphalt pollution || [https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-63/subpart-AAAAAAA?toc=1 \"40 CFR Part 63\"] refers to federal air pollutant regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations.

These have been combined to give AAAAAA — Usually, when you have to insert more than one AAA battery into a device's battery compartment, the batteries are put directly next to each other. That is shown here by putting two instances of AAA next to each other, thus \"AAAAAA.\" || 6\n|-\n| 29 || Unofficial Howard Dean slogan || A reference to Howard Dean, an American Democrat who ran for the party's nomination in 2004. He famously [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0 yelled at a rally] in a way that was thought to be bizarre and which, it is thought, doomed his campaign. || 7\n|-\n| 32 || A 4.0 report card || A 4.0 GPA, at least {{w|Academic_grading_in_the_United_States|in the USA}}, is all As.

AAA is the {{w|IATA}} code for its airport. || 3\n|-\n| 41 || Macaulay Culkin’s review of aftershave || In the movie ''{{w|Home Alone}}'', Kevin (played by {{w|Macaulay Culkin}}) puts on his father's aftershave lotion. The eight-year-old boy is not used to the lotion's antiseptic and screams as the stinging sensation kicks in. || 10\n|-\n| 43 || Marketing agency trade grp. || The {{w|American Association of Advertising Agencies}}, also called the 4As (here AAAA). An abbreviated word in a clue, here \"grp.\", is a common way to signal that the answer also should also be written as its abbreviation. || 4\n|-\n| 44 || Soaring climax of Linda Eder’s ''Man of La Mancha'' || Refers to [https://youtu.be/BWP7l0OTXJI?t=130 the 18-second-long wordless passage in Eder's opus], or possibly the final high note in the song \"The Impossible Dream\". || 15\n|-\n| 46 || Military flight community org. || The {{w|Army Aviation Association of America}}, or AAAA. || 4\n|-\n| 47 || Iconic line from ''Tarzan'' || Tarzan has a famous {{w|Tarzan yell|war cry}} he shouts, usually when swinging from a vine. || 10\n|-\n| 48 || '''E'''v'''e'''r'''y''' o'''t'''h'''e'''r letter of Jimmy Wales’s birth state || The birth state of {{w|Jimmy Wales}}, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is Alabama.

As mentioned previously, the A8 referenced here is their full-size luxury sedan. || 8\n|-\n| 8 || Fast path through a multiple choice marketing survey || The \"fast path\" is just to select the first option over and over again. Usually the options are labeled A, B, C, and D (or more) - choosing the first option for every question would be answering entirely with As. || 7\n|-\n| 9 || 12356631 in base 26 || Randall is expressing base 26 using the letters of the alphabet with 1=A, in which case 12356631<sub>10</sub> = AAAAAA<sub>26</sub>. (It's unclear how one would express the digit 0<sub>26</sub> this way.) || 6\n|-\n| 10 || Viral Jimmy Barnes chorus || A reference to the music video for Kirin J Callinan's song \"{{w|Big Enough}}\", which features rocker {{w|Jimmy Barnes}} in a cowboy hat screaming \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\" while in the sky over mountain scenes. || 15\n|-\n| 11 || Ruby Rhod catchphrase || Ruby Rhod is a radio host in the film ''{{w|The Fifth Element}}''; he has a scene with a memorable scream. || 5\n|-\n| 12 || badbeef + 9efcebbb || In hexadecimal, badbeef and 9efcebbb add together to equal AAAAAAAA (195,935,983, 2,667,375,547, and 2,863,311,530 in decimal respectively). || 8\n|-\n| 13 || In Wet Leg’s ''Ur Mum'', what the singer has been practicing || In the song \"{{w|Ur Mum}}\" by {{w|Wet Leg}}, the bridge starts with \"Okay, I've been practicing my longest and loudest scream\", which is apparently eight As long. || 8\n|-\n| 14 || Refrain from Nora Reed bot || The \"Endless Scream\" bot on social media, made by Nora Reed, posts \"AAAAAAAAAAA\" (with or without an h) at varying lengths. || 8\n|-\n| 20 || Mario button presses to ascend Minas Tirith’s walls || In ''Mario'' games you typically use the A button to jump. In games where you don't press a button to move (e.g., games with a joystick), then the button presses required to ascend a vertical structure would probably all be A. This clue might have been inspired by the {{w|Pannenkoek2012#A-button challenge|A-Button Challenge}} / [https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/A_Button_Challenge A Button Challenge], which tallies the number of A presses needed to beat ''Super Mario 64''. Additionally, {{w|Minas Tirith}} is a fictional city in ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings}}'' with seven concentric rings, each with a wall around it and higher than the last ring. Presumably, it takes seven jumps to get to the highest area of the city, so the answer is \"AAAAAAA\". || 7\n|-\n| 24 || Vermont historic route north from Bennington || {{w|Vermont Route 7A}}, or AAAAAAA. || 7 \n|-\n| 26 || High-budget video game || A high-budget video game is usually referred to as a Triple-A game, or AAA. || 3\n|-\n| 28 || Unorthodox Tic-tac-toe win || {{w|Tic-tac-toe}} is usually won by getting either three Xs or three Os in a row, making XXX and OOO normal Tic-tac-toe wins. One could achieve a win of AAA by making the unorthodox choice of playing with the letter A instead of X or O. Alternatively, Randall is envisaging the grid as defined by rows 1, 2, 3, and columns A, B, C, so an AAA win would be simply playing in the first column each time - a strategy which should be obvious and easy to stop, even for young children who have not yet worked out that ''any'' route to winning can be blocked. || 3\n|-\n| 29 || String whose SHA-256 hash ends \"…689510285e212385\" || <code>printf AAAAAAAA <nowiki>|</nowiki> sha256sum</code> outputs <code>c34ab6abb7b2bb595bc25c3b388c872fd1d575819a8f55cc689510285e212385</code>.\nNote that this 'clue' would be normally be ''particularly'' difficult, in isolation, as the nature of a {{w|hash function}} means that it is possible for multiple inputs to produce a given output, and that finding any of these (and definitely identifying ''all'' of them, to ensure you have the correct original) would require a {{w|brute-force attack}}; i.e. a test of all possible initial states to discover which of them might be viable candidates. Even more problematic is that we are only given a partial hash string, meaning we are possibly talking of a multiple of full hashes, each of them with a possible multiplicity of original plaintexts behind them. However, given the context of this puzzle, it's reasonable to guess that a sequence of 8 As might be the answer, and indeed its hash does match the clue given.\n<br/>The number of possible hashes in the clue is 16<sup>64</sup>/16<sup>16</sup>, i.e. 16<sup>48</sup>, or approximately 6x10<sup>54</sup>, although there really is no reason (aside from the fundamental impracticality) to try to solve this problem from each and every 'hash end'. Instead you would 'only' check every combination of 8 letters (presuming no digits, punctuation or whitespace would be inserted, that no \"foreign\"/accented characters are present and that uppercase is universally presumed, is 26<sup>8</sup>; i.e. ~208 {{w|billion|short-scale billion}} possibilities) and discover which (one?) of these sufficiently matches the hash fragment given. Testing a hundred of these every second, it would take a little over 66 ''years'' to complete the task of checking every single possibility (rather than stopping at the first confirmed answer, which might well be the initial one in this particular case).\n<br/>In the context of a crossword such as this, however, you can significantly reduce this search by having established (or at least sufficiently narrowed down) the answers to the various across-clues which intersect with ever character of it (this form of crossword grid being of the {{w|Crossword#American-style crosswords|dense type}}, with no singly-clued spaces as with the more open lattice-types), reducing the necessary checks drastically. This could mean, having solved at least some of the perpendicular answers, that you have enough information to 'guess' at some likely answer, and then merely need to ''confirm'' that whatever guess(es) you make will resolve themselves into the clue-answer provided. (Much as you might with a more normally difficult clue, where you merely have to satisfy yourself that the surprise answer is at least justified as resulting from the original hint.)\n| 8\n|-\n| 30 || Arnold’s remark to the Predator || A reference to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsFYPVxHKdc this scene] from ''{{w|Predator (film)|Predator}}'', starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. || 8\n|-\n| 31 || The vowels in the fire salamander’s binomial name || The vowels in {{w|Salamandra salamandra}} are aaaaaaaa. || 8\n|-\n| 32 || Janet Leigh ''Psycho'' line || The iconic scene in ''{{w|Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho}}'' is the shower scene, in which {{w|Janet Leigh}} gives a long piercing scream as she is murdered. This can be written as 8 As if one wishes. || 8\n|-\n| 34 || Seven 440Hz pulses || A sound with a frequency of 440 Hz is a middle \"A\" note. Seven such pulses would be AAAAAAA. || 7\n|-\n| 37 || Audi luxury sports sedan || Third of three Audi references. The A6, the one referenced here, is their executive car. Actually, the A7, their executive liftback sedan, would fit the prompt of \"luxury sports sedan\" better, but 37 only has room for six As. || 6\n|-\n| 38 || A half-dozen eggs with reasonably firm yolks || Eggs can be [https://www.saudereggs.com/blog/egg-grading-system/ \"graded on a variety of aspects\"], with grades B, A, or AA. Eggs with a reasonably firm yolk are graded A, so having half a dozen of them gives you AAAAAA eggs. || 6\n|-\n| 39 || 2-2-2-2-2-2 on a multitap phone keypad || A \"{{w|multi-tap|multitap keyboard}}\" is a text entry system for mobile phones. Most numbers are associated with three letters, and tapping the same number multiple times in rapid succession selects the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd letter. 2 is \"A\", 22 is \"B\", 222 is \"C\", 3 is \"D\", etc. 2-2-2-2-2-2 translates to \"AAAAAA\".
