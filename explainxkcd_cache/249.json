Such rides are popular at amusement parks, where people have to wait in long lines to get on a ride that can last less than two minutes.\n\nMany amusement parks have a spot where they take souvenir pictures as you are experiencing the ride. After you get off the ride, you can buy one picture or a set of pictures to commemorate riding the roller coaster. These pictures usually have people with their hands up, yelling and screaming. Wind may be going through their hair as they pass through the air at high speeds. \n\n[[Cueball]] is subverting the usual 'souvenir picture pose' by gluing chess pieces to a board and then staring at the board when the picture is taken. He {{tvtropes|DissonantSerenity|stands out in the picture as a calm person}} studiously studying a chess problem while everyone else yelps and whoops with excitement.\n\nThe title text refers to blindfold chess, which doesn't require any actual blindfold, it's just called that because the two players don't need a board and just communicate their moves. This would of course be impossible to photograph. This might also be a pun on actually not being able to see while playing chess, as the Aerosmith ride (officially the {{w|Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith}}) is indoors and not lit up, making it extremely hard to see anything while on the ride.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a desk with glue, chess pieces, and a chessboard, while his Cueball-like friend looks over his shoulder.]\n:Friend: What are you doing?\n:Cueball: Gluing down chess pieces.\n:Friend: Why?\n:Cueball: Because there's a picture I've always wanted... I'll need your coat to sneak this onto the ride.\n:[A photograph of a roller coaster ride with Cueball sitting in the first car, chin in hand, thinking over the chessboard and the rest of the people screaming with their hands up. The photograph has \"Mega Coaster 3000 souvenir photo\" written on the bottom margin.]\n\n==Trivia==\n*This comic [http://xkcd.com/chesscoaster/ inspired people to try this in real life], to awesome effect.\n*This comic is referenced in the bonus panel for [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303075020/https://mrlovenstein.com/comic/113#comic this comic] (hover the cursor over the empty whitespace underneath the comic).\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Chess]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Photography]]\n[[Category:Disney]]"
