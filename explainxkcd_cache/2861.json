The most familiar algebraic variable is ''x'' (the unknown input), with ''y'' often being the yet-to-be-determined output (its value being dependent on ''x''). According to the comic, the value of ''x'' has finally been found, being 4.1083.  The joke is that a general-purpose variable, which may take different values in different scenarios, turns out to have a specific value, as though it were a constant. Constants in mathematics and other scientific fields are also often represented by a single symbol - some of the most well-known are {{w|Pi|''Ï€''}} (3.14159...), ''e'' ({{w|E (mathematical constant)|Euler's number}}, 2.71828...), ''i'' (an {{w|Imaginary unit}}, where i<sup>2</sup> = -1), and ''c'' (the {{w|speed of light}} in a vacuum, 299,792,458 m/s (670,616,629 mph, 1,079,252,848.8 km/h, 1.8026x10<sup>12</sup> {{w|FFF system|fur/ftn}})).\n\nThe specific number 4.1083 does not have any notable significance or special role in the contexts of physics, chemistry, finance, astronomy or cryptography. This number to 3 decimal places, 4.108, was referenced previously in comic [[899: Number Line]]. \n\nThe '''title text''' declares the value of ''n'' is unknown. ''n'' is often used as an unknown/undetermined ''integer'' value. In {{w|Sampling (statistics)|statistics}}, it might be used to specify the size of a sample. For example, a list where ''n = 50'' would mean the list contains 50 data points, for which that number of iterations or a larger number of cross-comparisons might be expected.\n\nAccording to the title text, however, the value of ''n'' ''has'' been narrowed down to somewhere between 8 and 10<sup>500</sup>, or one hundred quinsexagintacentillion. This narrowing-down isn't particularly narrow, although it is perhaps quite specific compared to the 'pre-narrowing' possibilities of being absolutely any finite value at all.\n\nThe title text also says that this narrowing has ruled out the (usually) simplest values of 1 or 2. In mathematical problems involving iterating over multiple inputs of a function, or functions where the input is a list of variable size, the variable n is used to represent either the current iteration's input or the length of the input list. In both cases the inputs \"n=1\" and \"n=2\" are used as examples to demonstrate the function, to let the reader wrap their head around the basics of the function. The title text is spoofing the usage of \"n=1\" and \"n=2\" as if they were the leading theories for the constant value of n, and that these theories have been debunked by supposedly proving that n's minimum value is 8.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A math formula is circled.]\n:<big><big>x = 4.1083</big></big>\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n: Big math news: They finally figured out the value of x.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Math]]"
