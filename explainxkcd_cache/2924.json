The first three are actual physics models, while the last one is made up for absurdity. This is a recurring format of xkcd comics, as shown in [[2289: Scenario 4]].\n \n[[File:Oscillating pendulum.gif|200px|right|thumb|The motion and dynamics of simple pendulum]] The simple pendulum consists of a joint, rod, and weight, and when released (inside a gravity field or other accelerating force), it swings in a regular fashion. The \"period\" of a pendulum is the amount of time it takes to complete one cycle, swinging back and forth. In a simple pendulum, the period is consistent, predictable, and depends primarily on the length of the pendulum and the acceleration (being largely independent of both mass and length of arc). This predictability makes pendulums useful in applications such as timekeeping, where the earliest accurate clocks (such as a {{w|grandfather clock}}) made use of pendulums as regulators.\n<br style=\"clear:both\" />\n[[File:Double-compound-pendulum.gif|200px|left|thumb|The typical motion of a double compound pendulum]] The {{w|double pendulum}} consists of 2 joints, 2 rods, and a weight, and when released, it swings in a {{w|chaos theory|chaotic fashion}}. Interestingly, this follows by the mathematical definition of chaotic, being that small changes in initial conditions result in vast differences in end results. This pendulum is thus nearly unpredictable, and due to this chaotic nature, real life applications are very limited.\n<br style=\"clear:both\" />\n<!-- I'm still looking for a good (dynamic?) image for this spot, but this is obviously where it'd go... [[File:???.gif|200px|right|thumb|Kapitza's pendulum]] -->The {{w|inverted pendulum}} consists of a simple pendulum that is placed upside down, with some powered apparatus underneath vibrating it vertically to keep it upwards. If left unpowered it will fall, hence the \"unstable\" part. The comic appears to depict {{w|Kapitza's pendulum}}. See a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oGYCxkgnHQ video demonstration by Harvard Natural Sciences] or an interactive simulation [https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/inverted-pendulum-en.html from myphysicslab] or [http://mathigon.org/course/chaos/introduction mathigon].\n\nThe nightmare pendulum appears to be an inverted double pendulum on a vibrating base, with an additional uninverted pendulum swinging within its much more substantial weight (which is also adorned with {{w|grawlix}}es). The comic claims that this pendulum summons {{w|Maxwell's demon}}, jokingly implying that Maxwell’s demon is an actual demonic entity. This is not the case (though it would later be personified as one in [[3006: Demons]]): Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment in which a being - the demon -­­­­­ is posted at a tiny door between two gas vessels. It lets only slow-moving (cold) gas molecules move through the door in one direction, and only fast-moving (hot) ones in the other direction. One vessel gradually becomes hot and the other cold, violating the {{w|second law of thermodynamics}}. An actual machine doing that would require at least enough energy - in the form of information - so that no violation took place, but the thought experiment has stimulated much discussion since it was first proposed by {{w|James Clerk Maxwell}} in 1867.\n\nThe title text continues this joke explicitly, by referencing a real paper titled [https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/sm/c4sm00265b Vibro-levitation and inverted pendulum: parametric resonance in vibrating droplets and soft materials] and implying that the paper ties the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zoTKXXNQIU \"creepy fingers\"] produced in this way to Maxwell's demon.  The paper only actually suggests that the phenomenon is related to inverted pendulum dynamics. This gives a humorous example for the abuse of citations. Technically, the cited reference only supports the claim immediately before it, that the behavior of a cornstarch-water mix (also known as {{w|Non-Newtonian fluid#Oobleck|oobleck}}) can be modeled as inverted pendulums. But by proximity the reference also seems to support the part about Maxwell's demon. The illusion is helped by the description of the cornstarch as creepy, which is added in the beginning without any visible separation from the actual content of the citation.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four types of pendulums are shown in a single panel.
