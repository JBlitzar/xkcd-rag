Marketers have found that names with these infrequently-appearing letters sell more products.\n\n;Scores\n\nThere are two explanations for scores. Both of them share the fact that [[Randall]] must have used a car-name database to calculate letter frequency in car models.\n\nThere are 19 positive scores and 17 negative scores, which is interpreted differently in each explanation.\n\n;Score(x) = Frequency_in_cars(x) - Frequency_in_English(x)\nThis formula generates a positive number if a letter is more common in car models than in typical English (as X) which Randall then calls carlike. The formula generates a negative number if a letter's relative frequency in car models is lower than in typical English (as O) and Randall calls it English-like (more suitable for readable text). The letters F and B, with scores of 5 and -5, respectively, are about as common in English as in car models. With this nomenclature, the most English-like letter is Y because, while not the most common English letter, it is apparently extremely rare in car models. The most common letter in ordinary English is E, which is (presumably) fairly common in car models.\n\n;Score(x) = Frequency_in_cars(x)\nIt seems that Randall arbitrarily used positive and negative numbers: if a letter is very common in car models (as X) he calls it carlike. If a letter is very uncommon in car models (as O) he calls it English-like. With this nomenclature the most English-like letter is Y, but actually Y is the least carlike letter. The most common letter in ordinary English is E. Y on the other hand is just in the middle (place 13), which can't be called English-like.\n\n;Algorithm for the index\nRandall devised an index for car models which is the score average divided by 10.\n\n;Example\nWe take 2Chainz and add the scores of its different numbers and letters: 6 +27 -44 -14 -21 -46 +83 = -9\n\nThe average is -9/7 ≈ -1.29. Then we divide that by 10 and we get -0.129 or -0.13.\n\n;Names to avoid\n*Honda '''2Chainz''' - {{w|2 Chainz}} is an American rapper\n*Mitsubishi '''Fhqwhgads''' - A reference to a running joke on {{w|Homestar Runner}}.\n*Kia '''49andGothy''' - Gothy or gothic is a member of the {{w|goth subculture}}; most of its members are much younger than 49\n*Chevrolet '''Niceguy''' - A reference to the idiom \"nice guys finish last\".\n*Oldsmobile '''Goodwood''' - May be a reference to the {{w|Goodwood Festival of Speed}}\n*Infiniti '''Toothy69''' - \"69\" is slang for a sex position where two participants pleasure each other orally; for obvious reasons, many would not want teeth involved.\n*BMW '''Outhouse''' - Loose standing toilet, or {{w|Outhouse}}.\n*Volkswagen '''Woodpony 7oh7''' - Wood ponies are wooden constructions to give kids (and sometimes adults) the feeling of riding a horse, but don't actually move. 7oh7 is a way to pronounce 707, which could be a reference to the Boeing 707 passenger jet series.\n*Chrysler '''Uh Iono''' - When pronounced, sounds roughly like someone slurring [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iono \"Uh, I don't know\"]\n*Nissan '''Doody''' - An incredibly juvenile term meaning feces. May reference the unfortunately named {{w|Nissan Moco}}, which is Spanish for snot\n\n;Potential Hits\n*Honda '''3Chainz''' - A play on 2Chainz in the previous section; according to the table the number 2 has a score of 6 and the number 3 has a higher score of 55; the index will go up by (55-6)/7/10=0.7.\n*Subaru '''Andre3000''' - {{w|André 3000}} is an American rapper\n*Suzuki '''Sexism''' - Akihiro Suzuki is a Tokyo city assemblyman who made sexist remarks in June 2014.\n*Lincoln '''Marxism''' - {{w|Marxism}} is a political method of societal analysis which has been used to critique {{w|Capitalism}}. There are various essays noting {{w|Karl Marx|its founder}} and {{w|Abraham Lincoln}} exchanged letters during the American civil war. Lincoln is also the marque for the {{w|Ford Motor Company}}'s luxury vehicles, capitalist status symbols throughout the late 20th century. Its juxtaposition with Marxism is thus particularly ironic.\n*Hyundai '''Climax''' - In this context, an {{w|orgasm}}. The title text finds an excuse to add another \"x\" with the model '''SexClimax'''.\n*Porsche '''Zizek9000''' - A portmanteau referencing academic {{w|Slavoj Žižek}} and the {{w|Saab 9000}}\n*Lexus '''3&times;3Cutrix''' - 3&times;3 is a play on 4&times;4; this car presumably has 3 wheels. \"Executrix\" (in {{w|leet}} \"3&times;3Cutrix\") is the female counterpart of \"executor\", one who administers a will.\n*Acura '''PizzaJazz''' - The letter Z has a very high score, so using 4 of them in a fairly short name makes this a potential hit.\n*Ford '''SixAxle 4&times;4''' - A contradictory name, as the 4&times;4 refers to a vehicle that has all four wheels connected to the drivetrain, which would only use two axles. May also be a reference to the Sony PlayStation's {{w|Sixaxis controller}}.\n*Toyota '''Cervixxx''' - A portmanteau of {{w|cervix}} and XXX rating used by pornographic industry to make titles seem more extreme (see {{w|X rating}}). It being the highest scoring item on the list may be an attempt to show that {{w|sex sells}}.\n\nNote that Randall gives the symbol &times; the value of 126, which means he equates it with the letter x.\n:index(3&times;3Cutrix) = (+55 + score(&times;) +55 +27 -68 -18 +8 -21 +126)/9/10 = 3.22. This means that the score of the symbol &times; is 90&times;3.22 - 164 = 125.8\n\n;Title text\nAs mentioned in the comic, the index for the word \"climax\" is 2.48. However, applying the index to the phrase \"sexclimax\" yields a value of 2.72, higher than that for \"climax\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:{| style=\"text-align:center; border:0px; width:63%;\"\n| '''Certain letters and numbers are used<br/> disproportionately often in car models<br/> compared to regular text.'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:#808080\">(see:\"Rev-4 cr-x x3 G6 Maxx\")</span>\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"text-align:center; border:1pt black solid;\"\n| colspan=\"37\" | '''Letter and number scores based on relative frequency in car model names'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Carlike\n|| 60\n||\n|| 6\n|| 55\n|| 35\n|| 74\n|| 6\n||\n||\n||\n||\n||\n|| 27\n||\n||\n|| 5\n|| 27\n||\n||\n|| 64\n|| 32\n|| 12\n|| 19\n||\n||\n||\n|| 40\n|| 8\n|| 15\n||\n||\n|| 41\n||\n|| 126\n||\n|| 83\n|-\n||\n|| '''0'''\n|| '''1'''\n|| '''2'''\n|| '''3'''\n|| '''4'''\n|| '''5'''\n|| '''6'''\n|| '''7'''\n|| '''8'''\n|| '''9'''\n|| '''A'''\n|| '''B'''\n|| '''C'''\n|| '''D'''\n|| '''E'''\n|| '''F'''\n|| '''G'''\n|| '''H'''\n|| '''I'''\n|| '''J'''\n|| '''K'''\n|| '''L'''\n|| '''M'''\n|| '''N'''\n|| '''O'''\n|| '''P'''\n|| '''Q'''\n|| '''R'''\n|| '''S'''\n|| '''T'''\n|| '''U'''\n|| '''V'''\n|| '''W'''\n|| '''X'''\n|| '''Y'''\n|| '''Z'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | English-like\n||\n|| -74\n||\n||\n||\n||\n||\n|| -58\n|| -67\n|| -37\n|| -14\n|| -5 \n||\n|| -21\n|| -45\n||\n||\n|| -44\n|| -21\n||\n||\n||\n||\n|| -46\n|| -80\n|| -27\n||\n||\n||\n|| -18\n|| -68\n||\n|| -20\n||\n|| -90\n||\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"text-align:center; border:0px; width:63%;\"\n| '''Based on these scores, here are a<br/> few suggestions for car companies:'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:#808080;\">(with average letter scores)</span>\n|}\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1pt black solid; width:63%;\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Names to avoid'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Potential hits'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; color:#808080;\" | Honda\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''2Chainz''' (-0.13)\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; color:#808080;\" | Honda\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''3Chainz''' (0.57)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Mitsubishi\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Fhqwhgads''' (-0.62)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Subaru\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Andre3000''' (1.30)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Kia\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''49AndGothy''' (-2.96)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Suzuki\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Sexism''' (1.82)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Chevrolet\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Niceguy''' (-3.09)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Lincoln\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Marxism''' (2.17)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Oldsmobile\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''GoodWood''' (-4.44)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Hyundai\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Climax''' (2.48)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Infinity\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Toothy69''' (-4.51)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Porsche\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Zizek9000''' (3.06)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | BMW\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Outhouse''' (-4.85)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Lexus\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''3x3Cutrix''' (3.22)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Volkswagen\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Woodpony 7OH7''' (-5.70)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Acura\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''PizzaJazz''' (3.56)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Chrysler\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Uh Iono''' (-5.65)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Ford\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''SixAxle 4x4''' (3.95)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Nissan\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Doody''' (-5.84)\n| style=\"text-align:right; color:#808080;\" | Toyota\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''Cervixxx''' (4.85)\n|}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Later after the initial release of this comic Randall added a link to this page.
