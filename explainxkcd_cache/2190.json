But, she added, \"Drones don't bother me.\"\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nAnother comic which is a promotion of [[Randall|Randall's]] upcoming book ''[[How To]]'', to be released less than 3 weeks after this comic's release, on September 3, 2019. And this time permanent - as opposed to [[Disappearing Sunday Update]] from about two weeks before. It stars {{w|Serena Williams}}, an American professional tennis player and former world No. 1.\n\nMost book advertisements feature laudatory quotes from famous people or reviewers, but here, Serena Williams is quoted as saying \"It's a pretty bad idea\" about Randall's idea of her attacking drones as given by the title of the comic. That idea is one of the chapters in the book and Serena Williams actually agreed to go and shoot tennis balls after an old drone with a broken camera. This can be read in the [[Blag]] post that is linked at the bottom of the comic: [https://blog.xkcd.com/2019/08/16/serena-versus-the-drones/ Serena Versus the Drones].  Unlike other books, \"It's a pretty bad idea\" is a pretty good quote for his \"How To\" book given that many of Randall's humorous explorations of scientific methods of doing usual and unusual things are pretty bad ideas.\n\nAs usual with Randall there is no need to click on the link, as the entire image is a link to the blog post. This was mentioned in [[1572: xkcd Survey]], and even earlier in the banner for his [[Header text#2014-07-23_-_what_if.3F_book_tour|book tour]] for the ''[[What If? (book)|What If?]]'' book.\n\nThe title text says that Serena Williams said that if she wanted to defend herself against drones and if she had to use sports equipment, she would use a tennis racket and ball. Notably, according to the Blag post, this would be ineffective compared to throwing.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The first panel contains a quote, with a picture of Randall's new book ''how to'' to the right of it. The book is black with large blue text and smaller white text. On the book cover, in white drawings, can be seen Megan with a ladder and either Black or White Hat. Both are looking up on Cueball, who is floating in the air with a quadcopter drone beneath either leg and trying to plug an electric light bulb into a wire hanging down to his right. It seems he has already removed the broken light bulb, as he has a bulb in each hand. The quote to the book's left reads:]\n:\"It's a pretty bad idea.\"\n::—Serena Williams\n::::on my idea\n:Book: How To\n:Book: Randall Munroe\n:[Caption below this panel and above another set of panels:]\n:Which types of sports equipment would be most effective at bringing down a rogue photography drone? My new book features a real-world test by Serena Williams.\n\n:[A large panel shows Serena Williams, with curly hair and a ponytail, swinging her tennis racket to successfully smash a tennis ball into a quadcopter drone flying towards her. The ball has bounced off the drone, which has stopped mid-air engulfed with a small explosion. Two drones above the exploding drone fly towards her, as well as one other below. There is a broken drone on the ground in front of her, and three tennis balls lie behind her.]\n\n:[Three smaller panels are beneath the large panel. The first panel is smaller than the other two and a bit higher up than they are, overlaying the second panel. It shows Serena jumping with the racket held high. No drones are shown, but her shadow can be seen beneath her.]\n\n:[In the next panel, the left side of which is partially covered by the panel before it, Serena is hanging mid-air as she smashes her racket into a drone and breaks a rotor off it. Her shadow lies beneath her, and another drone is flying above her.]\n\n:[In the final panel, Serena is now standing again and faces to the left. She's taking another swing at two drones, but the drones evade her. The ground is covered in smashed-drone debris.]\n:[Caption beneath all the panels, with the word \"here\" in blue despite the entire comic being a link:]\n:To read an excerpt about Serena's drone battle, click <span style=\"color:blue\">here</span> or go to blog.xkcd.com\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Sport]]\n[[Category:Drones]]\n[[Category:Book promotion]]\n[[Category:How To]]"
