This identity states that ''e<sup>iπ</sup>'' + 1 = 0. Therefore, ''e<sup>iπ</sup>'' = &minus;1.\nThe humor from this comic is because of the seemingly arbitrary relationship between ''e'', ''π'', and ''i'' (the square root of &minus;1). ''e'' is the mathematical identity of which the derivative of ''e<sup>x</sup>'' with respect to ''x'' is still ''e<sup>x</sup>'', while ''π'' is the relationship between the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. Taking these two values and applying them to the value of ''i'' in such a manner makes it seem counter-intuitive that it would yield &minus;1 from basic analysis. The above linked Wikipedia page goes into good detail of how to derive this identity, as does [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dhHrg-KbJ0 this YouTube video]. If you know some basic calculus, then [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0YEaeIClKY this video] gives a geometric intuition.\n\nThe title text refers to how Euler's identity is called upon in complex form (separating real and imaginary numbers): ''e<sup>ix</sup>'' = cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'').\n\nFrom ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'':\n{{quote|I initially got the sign wrong here, and got 40 emails in 3 hours.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cueballs are standing at a board with writing on. One Cueball is pointing at the board.]\n:Cueball: Numbers of the form n√-1 are \"imaginary,\" but can still be used in equations.\n:Friend: Okay.\n:Cueball: And e^(π√-1)=-1.\n:Friend: Now you're just fucking with me.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
