An observation is required in order to \"collapse\" the system into a particular state; the {{w|thought experiment}} of {{w|Schr√∂dinger's cat}} is a popular way of explaining this concept. The title text proposes that, if a universe needed to be observed to exist, as with a quantum state, it would be a pretty sorry universe indeed, as who would exist to observe it if it needed to be observed in the first place?\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are inside each others' thought bubbles.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
