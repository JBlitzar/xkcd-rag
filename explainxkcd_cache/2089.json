Thus December 24 is Christmas Eve. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVpgHBSn6P4 Some people] extend this and call December 23 \"Christmas Eve Eve,\" as Christmas Eve is itself a noted holiday. The day before ''that'' would be \"Christmas Eve Eve Eve,\" adding one \"Eve\" for each night before Christmas morning, although the increasing extension leads to each additional \"Eve\" being continuously less common.\n\n[[Cueball]] notes the general idea, and [[Megan]] acknowledges it. Cueball follows by naming December 24 as Christmas Eve, December 25 as Christmas, and then mentions that the following day is his favorite. Megan's \"Oh no\" implies that she knows what Cueball will say next.\n\nSince December 26 is the 364th day before Christmas (when the following year is not a leap year, which was correct in 2018 when the comic was released), it follows that it is \"Christmas\" followed by \"Eve\" 364 times.\n\nMegan finds listening to Cueball recite this unacceptable. As such, she announces that she will not give him gifts, taking the extra step of returning the gifts she'd already bought. As Christmas presents in America are first handed out on Christmas Day's morning (unless the giver and recipient are aware in advance they will be unable to meet in person on that day; Megan's presence on Christmas Eve indicates this is not a threat), she has not given it to him yet.\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Boxing Day}} holiday celebrated the day after Christmas in the UK and many parts of the former British Empire. Although the exact origin of the name is unknown, it is believed to be in [https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/holidays-christmas/10-christmas-myths8.htm reference to the Alms Box] placed in areas of worship to collect donations to the poor, which was then opened right after Christmas. Most Americans don't know this and make jokes about how it refers to {{w|Boxing|the sport of boxing}}. In this title text we can presume Cueball was punched (or ''boxed'') after his litany of 364 ''Eve''s, to which he replies, \"Oh, so ''that's'' why they call it Boxing Day.\" As this is a pun of groan-inducing triviality, {{tvtropes|LamePunReaction|he receives another punch}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball with his arms out is talking with White Hat and Megan.
