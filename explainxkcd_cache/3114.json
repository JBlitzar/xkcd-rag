The cabin's sprinkler system often makes it really hard to keep anything lit.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Megan]] is demonstrating to [[Cueball]] how to build a campfire. She says she's going to use the {{w|Campfire#Construction_styles|\"log cabin\" method}}, which is a common [https://www.cabinlife.com/articles/the-5-best-campfire-lays-and-how-to-build-them/ method of laying out fuel for a small fire]. The concept is that sticks of wood are placed in layers, with each layer consisting of two sticks placed parallel to one another, with a gap between them. Each subsequent layer is placed perpendicular to the first, so that the sticks bridge the gap in the layer below. This creates an open space in the center in which the tinder, and usually some kindling, is placed and ignited. This method is so named because it vaguely resembles the walls of {{w|log cabins}}, which are also built by placing wooden logs in perpendicular layers to enclose a central space, though on a much larger scale.\n\nAt first, Megan's build appears similar to a typical 'log cabin' fire lay. It becomes unusually and unnecessarily detailed when she adds interior walls and miniature furniture in the tiny dwelling, suggesting that she's not just laying out fuel for a fire, but actually going to the trouble of building a miniature log cabin, with all the details and components of a real living space. Things truly take a twist toward the bizarre, however, when she adds plumbing and electrical components to the house. This is not only a complex model, but a structure that apparently includes all the functionality one would expect in a modern dwelling. A fault in the installed wiring then initiates a fire, leading to the promised campfire. Stripped of the complexity, Megan effectively built a campfire which was ignited by electrical heating. Igniting a fire with electricity (either using {{w|electric spark}}s or {{w|Joule_heating|resistive heating}}) is a real method, but not particularly common for campfires. Simulating a common cause of accidental {{w|structure_fire|house fires}}, which are both dangerous and traumatic (tens of thousands of people are killed in house fires every year), is somewhat morbid, which may be the reason Cueball seems so horrified.\n\nThe title text continues the joke, in that she usually finds that it needs more time for the fire to ignite, due to also installing a {{w|fire sprinkler system}}. Automatic sprinkler systems in buildings are typically to be triggered by fire and spray the area with water, wetting any potential fuel and dousing the fire before it spreads. The level of detail in Megan's cabin is not only wildly unnecessary, it's actively counterproductive to her supposed purpose of starting a fire. This campfire was only started rapidly because the sprinkler system didn't work properly.\n\nMegan says that she is going to build a square cabin, and this may be a reference to [[2891: Log Cabin]], as the log cabin contained a logarithmic spiral, and this square cabin is just a normal cabin.\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A tent in a field stands in the background to the left of Cueball, who stands behind Megan, who is kneeling and arranging sticks into the first few layers of a small log cabin.]\n:Cueball: Can you show me how to build a campfire?\n:Megan: Sure! We'll use the log cabin method.\n:Megan: First we build a square cabin out of sticks.\n\n:[Cueball now stands to the right of frame, opposite Megan with the cabin between them. The cabin has gotten taller and is becoming better defined. Megan holds a tiny table in one hand and tiny chair in the other.]\n:Megan: Next, we'll add interior walls, doors, and some cabin furniture made from twigs.\n:Cueball: This is very elaborate.\n\n:[The cabin now has a gable roof and an electrical wire leads from the base of the cabin to a coil of wire in Megan's hand and then off panel to the left. Lightning symbols above the wire indicate the wire is energized and perhaps shorting out.]\n:Megan: Now we'll add some rudimentary plumbing and electrical wiring. 50 amps, nothing fancy.\n:Cueball: It kind of seems like you're just building a cabin.\n:Megan: I just - \n:Megan: ...oops.\n\n:[The tiny log cabin is engulfed in flames. Cueball is leaning away from the cabin and holding his hand to shield his face from the heat.]\n:Megan: I think my wiring wasn't up to code.\n:Cueball: AAAAA!!\n:Megan: ... and that's how you build a fire!\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
