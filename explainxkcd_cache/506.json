Henry}}'s short story \"{{w|The Gift of the Magi}}.\" In O. Henry's story, a couple with very little money goes to great lengths to purchase gifts for one another. The wife sells her prized possession, her hair, to purchase a fancy chain for her husband's prize possession, a watch; the husband sells his watch to purchase some fancy hair accessories (clips/combs) for his wife. The story is about selflessness, as each party sold their prize possession to purchase something to enhance the other's prize possession.\n\nIn this comic, however, the opposite occurs: [[Black Hat]] stole [[Danish]]'s {{w|Roomba}} (an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner) and sold it to buy {{w|Left 4 Dead|a new game}} for his {{w|Xbox}}, while Danish stole Black Hat's Xbox and sold it to buy a \"dueling harness\" for her Roomba, highlighting their mutually destructive selfishness. Although these actions reflect their sociopathic personalities and are at each other's detriment, both are apparently touched by the symmetry of their actions and consequences, and both find their mutual selfishness to be appealing. This is a reversal of the typical reaction to the O. Henry story: although neither of the characters in that story can actually use their gift, the gifts are touching nevertheless because they represent the self-sacrificing love the characters have for each other.\n\nAn alternative interpretation is that the word \"AWW.\", rather than an expression of being touched, is an expression of disappointment.  Thus they are each disappointed by the turn of events.\n\nThe \"dueling harness,\" also mentioned in the title text, is an invention by [[Randall]], which presumably would allow Roombas to wield weapons and battle each other like the robots in ''{{w|Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars}}''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is holding up a copy of ''Left 4 Dead''. Danish is holding up a small harness.]\n:Black Hat: Hey. I sold your Roomba on Craigslist so I could buy myself ''Left 4 Dead''.\n:Danish: But I eBayed your XBox so I could get this dueling harness for my Roomba!\n:Black hat and Danish at the same time: Aww.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Danish]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Roomba]]"
