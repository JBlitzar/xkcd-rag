These songs usually either praise the United States for its perceived virtues or mock it for its perceived flaws. Regardless of the content of the song, one could likely sing such songs replacing each usage of the word \"America\" or \"American\" with another four-syllable word or phrase with emphasis on the second syllable, without disrupting the {{w|cadence}} or meter of the song. Words and phrases like this are said to \"{{w|Scansion|scan}}\" with the word \"America,\" which means to conform to that metrical pattern.\n\nThe comic provides a list of such names, most of which are locations. While some share virtues or flaws with the United States, most would fit into songs about the United States poorly, and only some are prominent enough to justify a song praising or mocking them. So the substitution is humorous for most of the examples. Other examples include Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Liberia, Nigeria, Bolivia, Siberia, Somalia, Albania, Bulgaria, Colombia, Cambodia, Armenia, Australia, Estonia, Mongolia, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, South Africa, El Salvador, the Alamo, the Netherlands, and the Philippines.\n\nNote that inhabitants of some real-world locations mentioned in this comic do not pronounce their names in a way that scans with \"America\". Also note that the adjective form of many of the places listed either does not exist or does not fit the same rhythmic structure as \"American\". (For instance, while \"Antarctican Idiot\" scans with \"American Idiot\", \"St. Petersburgian Idiot\" does not; meanwhile, \"Canada\" does not scan with \"America\", but \"Canadian\" does scan with \"American\" and was in fact used as such in Weird Al's parody, \"{{w|Canadian Idiot}}\".) In these cases, it would be necessary to use the noun form of the name to preserve the song's meter.\n\nThe title text provides an example: substituting \"{{w|Jurassic Park}}\" for \"America\" in the song \"{{w|America the Beautiful}}\".\n\nA similar comparison in \"scanning\" was made in [[1412: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].\n\n===Table of names matching the rythmic meter of America===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
