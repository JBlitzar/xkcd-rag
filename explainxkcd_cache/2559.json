It has suffered many, many delays over its development period (as previously referenced in [[2014: JWST Delays]]), but it finally launched on Christmas day, December 25, 2021.\n\nIn this comic, the James Webb Space Telescope is finally ready to take off. However, an unfortunate circumstance occurs: {{w|Santa Claus}} himself, presumably on his way to or from delivering presents to children, crosses into the path of the launch rocket. The joke is the implication that, right on the brink of success, this extraordinarily unlucky incident will either destroy the telescope, harm Santa, or cause yet another delay, much to [[Cueball]]'s horror.\n\nReal launch aborts have {{w|STS-68|occurred}} with fewer than 2 seconds left in the countdown, causing delays of over a month. \n\nAccording to the title text, the {{w|range safety officer}} has made the decision to shoot down Santa Claus's sleigh, in order to clear the sky above, protecting the launch window. This seems to demonstrate that they are determined not to let anything delay the launch any further (or that given a choice between destroying the telescope or destroying Santa, the range safety officer chooses the latter). \"Range Safety Officer\" is the job title of a person in charge of the safety of a launch. Range safety officer and other similar range officers are the subject of [[2876: Range Safety]]. That was the first comic after New Years day in 2024, so seems like Randall contemplated rocket launches around the Holidays... Also earlier in the Christmas comic of 2023 he also killed Santa using [[Hydrothermal Vents]]. Before this he has only killed Santa back in 2008 in the [[2008 Christmas Special]].\n\nAirspace is normally [https://simpleflying.com/rocket-launches-airline-traffic/ closed to air traffic] to avoid collisions between aircraft and rocket launches.  While Santa might not know about such restrictions, he already knows about this particular launch because thousands of astronomy geeks have asked for a new space telescope as a Christmas present in their letters to Santa, and the easiest way for Santa to deliver such a present is just keeping a safe distance from the launch pad. Moreover {{w|NORAD}} [https://www.noradsanta.org/en/ tracks Santa]'s flying around the world and would be able to give sufficient warning to both Santa and Ground Control to prevent such a close encounter of a festive kind; as well as to prevent accidental global thermonuclear war by {{w|1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident|confusing a small herd of flying reindeer}} with a first-strike attack by a foreign power. Finally, Santa Claus performs deliveries overnight, while the launch is scheduled for [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/science/webb-telescope-launch-date-livestream.html morning local time], so the timing of such a collision would not occur.\n\nThe JWST has been referenced previously in [[1730: Starshade]], [[2014: JWST Delays]], [[2447: Hammer Incident]] and [[2550: Webb]], is on the list of payloads in [[1461: Payloads]] and its planned use was indirectly referenced in [[975: Occulting Telescope]].  Santa is known to [[838|maintain a list of humans]] responsible for technological incidents and to have suitable punishment for offenders. 12 days after launch it was referenced again in [[2564: Sunshield]].\n\n===Trivia about posting time===\nThe release day of this comic was Christmas Eve the 24th of December. As can be seen from when [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=2559:_December_25th_Launch&oldid=223041 this page] was created 05:02:00, 25 December 2021 (UTC), the comic came out at least 7 hours before {{w|Ariane flight VA256|launch}} which was 12:20:00, 25 December 2021 (UTC). Since Boston ([[Randall|Randall's]] home town) is 5 hours after UTC then the comic must have released close to midnight on the 24th for Randall, and clearly before midnight for the rest of the time zones in the US. \n\nWeb comics are usually drawn some time in advance. When this comic was drawn and scheduled for publication, it is possible NASA had not yet [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-update announced] that the launch of JWST was slipping from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day.\n\nThe launch was probably three days after [[Randall]] opened the last number in his [[2550: Webb|Webb]] advent calendar. (Thus this is the second [[:Category:Christmas|Christmas comic]] this year referring to the telescope).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Close-up of the top of the James Webb Space Telescope launch rocket.
