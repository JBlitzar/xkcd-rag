Could that be the right approach? We contacted several researchers who are experts in emotional spirals to ask them, but none of them were in a state to speak with us.\"\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is about the difficulty of dealing psychologically with 50/50 odds and is likely inspired by the {{w|2024 United States presidential election}}. This comic was released the day before Election Day, and the media had been reporting (based off of voter polls) that the two presidential candidates, [[Kamala Harris]] and [[Donald Trump]], were closely contesting for the White House. The odds of the election were close to 50/50, including sources such as [https://www.270towin.com/2024-presidential-election-polls/ 270 to Win], [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html/ the New York Times], and [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/ FiveThirtyEight]. It seems more people suffer from [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/election-anxiety.html/ pre-election] [https://fortune.com/well/article/election-anxiety/ anxiety], and the uncertainty of the results doesn't help.\n\nFurthermore, with regards to N/A - the odds of \"precisely\" 50/50 are probabilistically zero, unless the event under consideration is something relatively trivial such as a coinflip or die roll (and even with those it is extremely unlikely the coins or dice are perfectly \"fair\").  Any scenario that involves social sciences, such as an election (or even a single relationship) will never be precisely 50/50 (or, indeed, *any* discrete value).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Odds\n!How to think about it in an emotionally healthy way\n!Explanation\n|-\n| Good outcome more likely || Recognize that the bad outcome is possible, but be reassured that the odds are in your favor || An optimistic attitude with a dose of realism.\n|-\n| Bad outcome more likely || Prepare for the bad outcome while remembering that the future isn't certain and hope is justified || A realistic attitude with a dose of optimism.\n|-\n| Precisely 50/50 || ????? N/A ???? || {{w|N/A}} stands for \"not available\", \"no answer\", \"not applicable\" or \"not assessed\". The actual worst case scenario, with no single obvious stance to take. (Thus also leaving ambiguous which fall-back position one should prepare to hold in reserve.)\n|}\n\nThe title text is a joke making use of ambiguous wording: \"researchers who are experts in emotional spirals\" could either refer to researchers who study emotional spirals, or researchers who are undergoing emotional spirals themselves. Evidently, all the researchers \"we\" contacted were the latter, and thus unable to advise the comic.\n\nRandall had previously dealt with the possibility of a tied electoral count 12 years prior, in the ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article ''{{what if|19|Tie Vote}}\n\n==Transcript==\n[A table titled \"Coping With Probabilistic Uncertainty\", with two columns labeled \"Scenario\" and \"How to think about it in an emotionally healthy way\". The boxes in the Scenario column contains text followed by a rectangle split into two parts; the left part is a smiley face, the right part is a frowny face with slanted, angry eyes.]\n\n:[Row 1, column 1:] \"Good outcome more likely\". The smiley face portion of the rectangle is about 75% and is bigger than the frowny face.\n:[Row 1, column 2:] \"Recognize that the bad outcome is possible, but be reassured that the odds are in your favor\".\n\n\n:[Row 2, column 1:] \"Bad outcome more likely\". The smiley face portion of the rectangle is about 25% and is smaller than the frowny face.\n:[Row 2, column 2:] \"Prepare for the bad outcome while remembering that the future isn't certain and hope is justified\".\n\n\n:[Row 3, column 1:] \"Precisely 50/50\". The rectangle is split in half and both faces are equal sizes.\n:[Row 3, column 2:] \"????? N/A ????\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Psychology]] [[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]"
