The punchline is that space {{w|rocket}}s travel so dangerously fast, and crashes are so utterly catastrophic, that it pushes literally every other kind of crash to the \"slow and safe\" corner by comparison. (A similar punchline was used in the title text of [[388: Fuck Grapefruit]].)\n\nWith the plot Randall makes the observation that the danger of a crash is greatly influenced by its speed and highlights the concept of relativity between what we perceive as \"fast,\" normal sports and two different types of racing cars, vs. a much faster vehicle, a rocket during launch. A rocket may appear to ascend slowly (and of course it begins its ascent slowly), but on the way to orbit it ends up moving very fast. But before it reaches the more extreme speed regime it will be far away from the ground (and the casual observer), where there is nothing to compare this speed to as opposed to a race car speeding by a spectator during a race.\n\nApart from the high speed, there is also the altitude to take into account for a rocket launch, and the vast amount of fuel needed to get into orbit, and any sort of catastrophic failure is almost certainly fatal ({{w|Apollo 13}} notwithstanding).\n\nRacing cars are often involved in crashes, but at that speed it is possible to construct them so even serious crashes may not be fatal. Although rockets are also made as safe as possible, it is a completely different regime of ''speed and danger'', and the risk of something going wrong during a take off is much higher,{{Actual citation needed}} and it is impossible to prevent a lethal disaster if the launch fails during the ascent. This results in a much higher mortality rate for each crashed rocket (probably 100%) vs. crashed sports/race cars.\n\nRocket launches are compared to \"normal {{w|sports}}\" (presumably meaning people running approximately 25 km/h, and possibly also {{w|polo}} {{w|horse}}s galloping approximately 40 km/h), {{w|NASCAR}} (which reaches speed of 320 km/h), and {{w|Formula One}} (F1), where the fastest race cars go 380 km/h. Although peak speed for an F1 car is higher than NASCAR, the average lap speed is much lower as F1 tracks have slow corners while NASCAR ovals can be negotiated with much less speed variation. It is also arguable whether F1 is more dangerous than NASCAR - there have been fewer fatalities in F1 this millennium, though fewer cars compete and races are of shorter duration. The 2016 Formula one season had 21 races, with each race lasting 1.5~3 hours. The NASCAR season had 36 races, with each race lasting 3~5 hours.\n\nA rocket launched to reach the {{w|International Space Station|ISS}} needs to match the speed of the space station which moves at 27,600 km/h. A rocket that needs to {{w|Escape velocity|escape}} from Earth needs to reach 40,270 km/h, but so far no humans have escaped. However, the astronauts going to the Moon came close, with {{w|Apollo 10}} setting the {{w|List_of_spaceflight_records#Fastest|speed record}} for manned flights with 39,896 km/h. (It was only about [https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Apollo-10-the-fastest-of-all-the-Apollo-missions 0.4% faster] than the next 7 missions that, in contrast to Apollo 10, were supposed to land on the Moon). The lowest of the rocket speeds mentioned above  is still more than 70 times as fast as the highest speed for race cars.\n\nThe title text serves to emphasize the point further, as an astronaut (used to the several G's of acceleration during takeoff and overall much higher speeds) would likely find a NASCAR car moving at ~300 km/h paltry compared to what they're acclimated to and has supposedly aggravated NASCAR drivers by making a point of saying so. And thus this is used to explain why there are no passenger seats in NASCAR cars, to prevent astronauts from joining the drivers for a nice, slow ride.\n\nOf the many [[:Category:Charts|charts in xkcd]] this one is notable for containing the fewest sample points of any [[:Category:Scatter plots|scatter plots]] in xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A two-axis diagram with two double headed arrows centered in the middle of the panel.
