Traditionally the name \"{{w|surfing}}\" refers to riding a {{w|surfboard}} that is itself floating on the {{w|Wind wave|ocean waves}} as they crash into shore, but in colloquial English it is possible to \"surf\" other things such as a {{w|Crowd surfing|crowd of people}}, the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN9I2kwQLbw floor of a moving bus], a [https://new.mta.info/press-release/icymi-governor-hochul-mta-and-mayor-adams-unveil-comprehensive-campaign-combat-subway subway car], or the {{w|Internet}}.\n\nIn this comic, [[Beret Guy]] is surfing the Earth's tectonic plates. Tectonic plates move very slowly compared to a normal surfing experience — so slowly, ordinary people perceive them to be stationary ground. But Beret Guy, in typical Beret Guy fashion, sees the broader picture in the most whimsical way possible and is now surfing the plates across the Earth's mantle below. He seems to be moving horizontally at about 4-5 cm/year (~1 m/20 yrs) which would put him on one of the [https://www.pnsn.org/outreach/about-earthquakes/plate-tectonics moderately fast] [https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tectonics.html plates], at least relative to the more stable North American plate. For comparison, the fastest-moving plate, the Pacific Plate, would move about two meters in 20 years relative to the African Plate (which is used as the standard which all other plate motions are measured against).\n\nWhile doing this he says [https://www.wavetribe.com/blogs/surfboards-waves/glossary-of-surfing-terms-and-surf-slang#R \"Radical\"], [https://www.starsurfcamps.com/news/know-your-surfing-lingo-surf-jargon/ \"Gnarly\"], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_sign \"Hang loose\"] which are exclamations commonly used among surfers. After 20 years, he is still standing there, having moved about one meter with the continental plate. This is thus another of the [[:Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy|strange powers of Beret Guy]] — being able to stay in place for 20 years. This was also seen in [[1088: Five Years]], where he waited five years to find out where he would be after that time.\n\nThe title text refers to riding the barrel, in which one surfs inside the hollow part of a breaking wave, while a wipe out means you get swept off your surf board. If you wipe out in a barrel, you most likely submerge under water. If this were possible in tectonic surfing, you would be stuck under a tectonic plate and you would have to wait until the material you're trapped in erodes. In reality, there's no such thing as breaking waves in plate tectonics, but there are {{w|Fold (geology)|geological folds}} that can be seen as similar to the way that turbulent water mixes. Things do get trapped when two tectonic plates collide in a process called {{w|subduction}}, in which one plate disappears below another.\n\nOf note, Beret Guy is mentioned to have a \"subduction license\", as seen in [[1388: Subduction License]], so he may have some recourse in such a situation. Due to said license, he would survive and reemerge from the continental plate barrel in a million years time.\n\nA previous comic about tectonics being slow is [[2061: Tectonics Game]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball walks up to Beret Guy who is standing with one leg in front of another and his arms spread wide.]\n:Cueball: What are you doing?\n:Beret Guy: Tectonic surfing!\n\n:[Cueball is standing behind Beret Guy, who is in the same pose.]\n:Beret Guy: Radical!\n:Beret Guy: Gnarly!\n:Beret Guy: Hang loose!\n\n:[Beret Guy is alone, still in the same position in the center of the panel.]\n\n:[Beret Guy is in the same position, but at the right edge of the panel with his head partly outside the right edge.
