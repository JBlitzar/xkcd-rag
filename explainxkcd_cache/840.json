The comic implies that instead of silly describing the movement of the putty; it describes the emotion of the putty.\n\nSerious Putty on the other hand, would not even like to be touched, because it would prevent it from doing whatever important task it needed to do.\nAs it says in the title text {{w|PuTTY}} is a Windows Terminal client. {{w|Impact (typeface)|Impact}} is a font that is distributed with Windows that is used in the vast majority of \"{{w|internet meme|meme}}\" image macros, such as {{w|lolcat}} pictures.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing next to a table. There is a can on the table.]\n\n:[The label on the can reads, \"Serious Putty\".]\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the table again.]\n\n:[He reaches out to touch the can. The can speaks.]\n:Can: Don't touch me.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
