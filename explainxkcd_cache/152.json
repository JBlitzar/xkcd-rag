Now to find that place.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic would later be updated in [[2331: Hamster Ball 2]]. The comic starts with a {{w|genie}}, who, having been freed from a magical lamp, grants the owner three wishes; this isn't unusual, since the {{w|Genie in popular culture|idea of a genie}} who does this is a very {{tvtropes|GenieInABottle|common trope}} in the fantasy genre. [[Cueball]] asks for a human-sized {{w|hamster ball}}, and when he gets it, he starts to roll around in it, obviously entertained. The genie then asks what he would like for his {{tvtropes|ThreeWishes|other two wishes}}, to which, having already being granted his heart's desire, he states that he wouldn't need the other wishes for anything.\n\nThe title text refers to the activity of {{w|Zorbing}}. Later, [[Randall]] found out where to get one and went on a [[211: Hamster Ball Heist|hamster ball heist]], and hamster balls have been a [[Category:Hamster balls|recurring theme]] on xkcd since this comic, and 14 years later it received a direct sequel [[2331: Hamster Ball 2]]. This comic is referenced in [[1975: Right Click]], where one of the things the ADVENT.EXE wishing well allows you to wish for is a human-sized hamster ball. Doing so redirects you to this page.\n\nGenies (or magic lamps) are mentioned in at least five other comics: [[532: Piano]], [[879: Lamp]], [[1391: Darkness]], [[2193: Well-Ordering Principle]], and [[2741: Wish Interpretation]]. In the first two, Randall manages to use the concept to make penis-related jokes. In the fourth, the issue of number of wishes is discussed, from the perspective of wanting more than three wishes. The issue of wishing for more wishes is also the subject of [[1086: Eyelash Wish Log]], so it is not always enough with one or even three wishes!\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands by a genie, whose lower body becomes smoke and trails down to an old-fashioned lamp.]\n:Genie: You have awakened me from the lamp. You may have three wishes. What does your heart desire?\n:Cueball: I'd like a human-sized hamster ball.\n\n:[A hamster ball appears; Cueball is inside it, arms outstretched.]\n:Cueball: Sweet!\n\n:[Cueball steps to left; the ball rolls that way.]\n\n:[He does the same thing to his right.]\n\n:[Cueball comes to rest in the center of the panel.]\n\n:Genie: And your other wishes?\n:Cueball: Why would I need other wishes?\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was [[:Category:Sunday comics|released on a Sunday]]. The Monday release was then skipped, and the next comic came out Wednesday. So, this was likely supposed to be a Monday release.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Hamster Ball]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Hamster Ball]]\n[[Category:Genie]]\n[[Category:Hamster balls]]"
