If it helps, it can also double as a mnemonic for remembering your young relatives' birthdays, if they happened to have been born on February 5th, 2018.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nCueball and Megan are on vacation or otherwise traveling, and receive a code for their hotel room. Megan gives a seemingly nonsensical and unhelpful {{w|mnemonic}} by which Cueball can remember it... which, inexplicably, actually ''helps'' Cueball to remember the code. Cueball becomes VERY angry on realizing this.\n\nThe first three {{w|prime numbers}} are actually 2, 3, and 5. So this technique easily identifies the first two digits \"02\". \"05\" is slightly wrong because it's not the second prime number; it's the third. And \"18\" is even more wrong because it's not actually a prime number; it's 2 Ã— 3<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSo the mnemonic itself doesn't really provide the method for remembering the code. Instead, figuring out how to apply the bogus mnemonic will reinforce your memory of the code. Unless you actually happen to be really bad at prime numbers and panicked while remembering them, in which case the bad mnemonic actually... helps?! Why ''is'' your memory like this?!\n\nThe title text points out that the code is also similar to a date in the ([[ISO 8601|potentially ambiguous]]) MMDDYY format - not an unexpected choice, seeing as Randall lives in the United States - so if you happen to have a relative who was born on February 5th 2018, the memorized code will help you remember this date if using said date format.  It is also a valid date in the DDMMYY format but in that case it would be the 2nd of May 2018, or in YYMMDD format, in which case it refers to 18th of May 2002.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is standing next to Cueball, who is holding a phone or a note in his hand. Each one has a suitcase on the out-facing side of them.]\n:Cueball: Okay, I need to remember that the room code is 020518.\n\n:[Closeup on Megan who has her palm raised.] \n:Megan: Easy -- just memorize it as \"the first three prime numbers, if you realized you couldn't remember what came after 2 and started to panic and get them increasingly wrong.\"\n\n:[Beat panel of Megan and Cueball standing with no border.]\n\n:[Megan and Cueball still standing.]\n:Megan: ...Are you mad because that actually works?\n:Cueball: '''''Why is memory like this?'''''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Math]]"
