As living things typically don't survive being fossilized in volcano debris,{{Citation needed}} the answer to the question would obviously be \"no\", but Cueball replies that he is unsure. Even if the dinosaur somehow survived the initial burial, it would be very difficult for it to survive being buried for 125 million years. 2020 probably wouldn't be the best year to dig it up and potentially let it free.\n\nIt is not an uncommon shortcut to refer to finds of relatively intact fossilized pieces of an animal using wording that sounds like they found an entire animal intact, as in the headline \"New dinosaur discovered\" rather than a wordier but more accurate \"the fossil of a new dinosaur\" or \"the fossilized bones of a new dinosaur\".  Most parts of an animal dead for millions of years don't survive that length of time, and those that do are usually transformed into something else, such as bones becoming fossilized into rock and minerals.\n\nMegan's response is natural and expected in many situations when hearing of a person or creature experiencing misfortune. The humor here comes from the inaptness of asking the question millions of years after the event. Rather than responding to the ridiculousness of Megan's question, Cueball takes it seriously, and deadpans that he can't tell.\n\nThe title text suggests contacting its \"{{w|next of kin}}\", which usually means a nearest living relative, e.g. a brother or a sister, and if not, the parents. The process of identifying and contacting next of kin is a standard step performed by authorities in the event of a death being discovered. The reason for this step is to allow the next of kin to exercise their rights to the property of the deceased under inheritance law. In this case, non-avian dinosaurs are extinct,{{Citation needed}} so it is the job of {{w|Phylogenetics|phylogeneticist}}s (those who study evolutionary relationships) to determine which living animal (presumably a bird of some kind) is the \"nearest relative\" to the deceased dinosaurs. However, even if the correct species could be identified, the specific animal would be all but impossible to find.  Statistically speaking, that dinosaur is almost certainly either {{w|Identical ancestors point|a direct ancestor of all living birds}}, [[1545|or else an ancestor of no living birds]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is standing facing right, talking to Cueball who is sitting at a computer desk and also facing right, looking at a computer screen.]\n:Cueball: Oh cool, they just found a dinosaur that was buried by a volcanic eruption 125 million years ago.\n:Megan: Wow.\n\n:[Pause. Megan is still facing right. Panel closes in on Megan and Cueball is not shown. This panel has no dialogue.]\n\n:[Megan has stepped closer to Cueball, who leans in and is still looking at the screen.]\n:Megan: Was it okay?\n:Cueball: Hmm, it doesn't say.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Biology]]"
