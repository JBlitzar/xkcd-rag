The previous one was [[49: Want]], and the next one was [[54: Science]]. It was among the [[:Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com|last eleven comics]] posted both on LiveJournal and on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] after the new site was launched. This comic was published on the same day across both sites, but not all of them shared the same posting day.\n\n==Explanation==\n[https://www.penny-arcade.com Penny Arcade] is a popular web comic that focuses on video game culture. The character in the comic is Tycho Brahe, one of the two main characters of the webcomic (the other being Jonathan \"Gabe\" Gabriel). Penny Arcade has a reputation for making obscure references to video games without explaining, expecting the reader to be as well-versed in gaming culture as they are, represented by the attitude shown in this comic. 'Seiken Densetsu', as mentioned in the strip, probably refers to ''Seiken Densetsu 3'', an {{w|Action role-playing game}} (Action-RPG) released for the {{w|Super Nintendo Entertainment System}} (SNES) in Japan in 1995, later to be known by the English title of ''{{w|Trials of Mana}}''. The game was neither released in the North American region nor officially translated to English until the release of ''{{w|Collection of Mana}}'' on June 11, 2019, more than thirteen years after this strip. However, many North American game players might also have recognized ''Seiken Densetsu 2'', the predecessor in the series, by its North American name of ''{{w|Secret of Mana}}''.\n\nThe title text acknowledges they know they behave like this, but they are indifferent to it and even joke about it into their own comics.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A color drawing of Tycho, a man with wild brown hair in blue and cyan colored shirt. He has a big open mouth and holds one arm up while the other may be in his (unseen) pocket. He has two speech bubbles,]\n:Tycho: You know what? If you've never played the 1995 SNES RPG \"''Seiken Densetsu''\", don't even <u>bother</u> reading today's strip. \n:Tycho: We don't <u>need</u> your kind here.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was [[:Category:Tuesday comics|released on a Tuesday]]. It was released only an hour and 53 minutes after midnight at 1:53 AM.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 47]]\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
