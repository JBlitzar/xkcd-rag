These vegetables look quite different from each other, though all share the same basic appearance; compare, for example, {{w|cabbage}}, {{w|broccoli}}, {{w|kale}} and {{w|brussels sprouts}}.\n\nIn the comic, Cueball, who is serving as a natural-history tour guide or park ranger, or maybe is just leading a group of friends, declares that the \"mighty redwood\" (presumably the coast redwood,  ''{{w|Sequoia sempervirens}}'') also belongs to this species. Since the coast redwood is a {{w|conifer}}, while ''B. oleracea'' is a {{w|flowering plant}}, the two species are about as different as two land plants can be, both in classification and appearance.\n\nHowever, when viewed from high above, the canopy of forests can bear a striking resemblance to the top of a head of many of these cultivars. In this case, the pointier tops of conifers would more likely resemble a {{w|Romanesco_broccoli|romanesco}}, while broad-leaved forests would be closer to the more commonly encountered calabrese. Such far-fetched resemblances could be used by a botanist as a joke to see if anyone is paying enough attention to call them out, which according to the caption, seems like something botanists do every year or two.\n\nThe title text refers to Sequoia Brussels sprouts. The reference is probably to the Giant Sequoia (''{{w|Sequoiadendron giganteum}}''), a close relative of the coast redwood. \"Resinous\" is probably a more apt adjective than \"delicious\", and they're probably woody. Additionally, as stated, they would indeed be quite hard to finish - Sequoia trees can range from {{w|Sequoiadendron giganteum|50-85 meters}} in height, and so consuming them will take weeks or maybe months, a monotonous task despite their \"deliciousness\". It is probably no more advisable{{citation needed}} to stand under a sequoia bearing sprouts than it is to stand under a [https://www.kuriositas.com/2010/10/dont-stand-under-cannonball-tree.html cannonball tree].\n\n==Transcript==\n:: [Cueball, Megan and another Cueball are standing in front of a large tree.
