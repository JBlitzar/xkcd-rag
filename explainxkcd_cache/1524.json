The spatial dimensions don't necessarily have to be the familiar Cartesian system (Forward/backward, Right/Left, Up/Down), but can be described in many ways (like the spherical or cylindrical system). In spite of the fact that we are being pushed around the universe by being on Earth, we can exercise some control over these spatial dimensions by moving, and therefore our trajectory through these dimensions is not inexorable (impossible to stop). As we only can go one direction in time and have no way of changing the speed or direction, we also are figuratively being pushed through time, and this movement is inexorable.\n\n[[Cueball]] sits under a tree un-moving with [[Megan]] simply enjoying the passage of time and says, \"Of the four dimensions I could have spent my life being pushed inexorably forward through, I guess 'time' isn't the worst.\" All of this amounts to an unusually erudite way for Cueball to say he feels content with how his life has turned out, despite the natural doubts one has as they get older.\n\nRather less romantically, it is possible that Cueball has merely been contemplating the fact that, if he were being inexorably pushed through one of the other spatial dimensions instead of time, he'd spend his entire life flying through space uncontrollably, maybe even out into outer space and to his death. Indeed, the unstoppable passage of time seems rather pleasant by comparison.\n\nIn the title text, Cueball then continues to muse about his favorite dimensions and places time in his top three dimensions. This means that one of the three spatial dimensions must be his least favorite. Though it is impossible to determine how he defines his favorite dimensions, as dimensions can be defined somewhat arbitrarily, they likely are length, height, and time as comics only use these three (time being represented by panels). Since {{what if|64|rising steadily}} and {{what if|135|digging downward}} are both pretty lethal, one could assume that Randall's least favorite dimension is up/down. (See also the ''one of my favorite halves'' comment in [[1556: The Sky]]) This could also be a reference to [[1190: Time]]. \n\nPreviously Randall has made a comic about a man who was pushed sideways â€” so he was pushed both through time and fell sideways: [[417: The Man Who Fell Sideways]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting up against a tree, Megan lies with her hands behind her neck in front him under the foliage of the tree.]\n:Cueball: Of the four dimensions I could have spent my life being pushed inexorably forward through, I guess \"time\" isn't the worst.\n\n==Trivia==\nInterestingly, [[Randall]] has already, back in the December 2014 issue of Wired magazine, published the [http://www.wired.com/2014/11/xkcd-guide-to-dimensions/ xkcd guide to dimensions] where the main part of this comic was already used in panel 9 out of 20. This issue of Wired magazine was about multiple dimensions, and Randall's section is about imagining higher dimension. The article is a mix of xkcd-style comics and captions explaining them.  The panel in question show Cueball saying, \"Of '''all the''' dimensions I could have spent my life being pushed inexorably through, I guess \"time\" isn't the worst.\" (the only difference being that \"all the\" has been changed to \"the four\" in this comic). In panel 15 of the Wired comic series, Randall considers how dimensions can be represented in a two-dimensional comic strip: a character moving within a panel represents movement in space but movement from panel to panel represents movement in time.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Time]]"
