Move them from the table into the trivia section and provide the original comic picture (with errors).}}\nThe comic consists of a flowchart depicting various ways to tell what era a map is from based on present country borders and land forms. (Except in the Not a Political Map Branch (from \"Can you see the familiar continents?\" downwards), the comic applies to a political map.) While many of the options are very serious, a few bizarre options reference fictional maps (Pratchett's {{w|Discworld}}, Lewis's {{w|Narnia}} and Tolkien's {{w|Middle-earth}}), or consider that cats, seagulls, staplers, tubas or breadboxes could be mistaken for a map. Randall also mentions US President {{w|Jimmy Carter}} being [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter_rabbit_incident attacked by a giant swimming rabbit], an event previously referenced as one we must never forget in [[204: America]].\n\nThe flowchart, although probably effective in eventually identifying the production year of certain maps, is designed in a rather inefficient way, as some early distinctions are already on a very detailed level before some really important distinctions (fictional or non-political map) are made. This, of course, adds to the humorous tone of the comic. It is also hampered by several smaller or larger errors (see [[#Trivia|trivia]]), the biggest being a whole section on I-25 that gives years in the range 1948–1952, before I-25 was built, and coming from a question that fixed the year range to 1960–1961.\n\nAdditionally, (possible) future maps including a \"Radioactive Exclusion Zone\" in the place of Colorado are mentioned. It predicts that some kind of nuclear incident will occur in Colorado (possibly at Rulison or Rio Blanco nuclear testing sites) in 2022. It also predicts that the area will be infested by radioactive spiders one year later. As it is now several years beyond that date, we see that both claims have been proven incorrect.\n\nThe title text continues the path where the user has confused a seagull for a map by inquiring if the (presumed) seagull might be a banshee based on the effect of its screams.\n\n===Table===\nGoing through the flowchart, taking the leftmost path first, recursively.

Other names have also been used at various points. {{w|Istanbul}} has been the official name in Western languages since the 1920s (although it's been the native name since 1453), although Western maps often referred to it as Constantinople as late as the 1960s; on the flowchart, the choice of name appears to go with the 1920s date.

Colorado houses several important USA defense installations which, in popular culture, become targets for nuclear strikes in the event of an all out war between the USA and Russia (for example over the {{w|political status of Crimea}}). Installations include {{w|Peterson Air Force Base}} and the heavily fortified {{w|Cheyenne Mountain Complex}} housing {{w|NORAD}} command functions. Colorado also has a previous history of radioactive contamination–it was home to uranium mines, nuclear tests (including {{w|Project Rulison}}, an attempt to use nuclear bombs to drill for natural gas that ended up making the gas radioactive) and the controversial {{w|Rocky Flats Plant}}, a nuclear weapons manufacturing facility that suffered {{w|Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|several fires and leaks}} and was ultimately raided and shut down by the FBI.   None of these has yet caused spiders to mutate.{{Citation needed}}\n|2014+\n|\n* Colorado: 2014–2021\n* Danger: 2022+\n|\n* Colorado: 2014–2021 ('''Stop''')\n* Danger: 2022+ (Go to 75)\n|-\n! 75\n| '''Does the warning mention the spiders?'''\n| Presumably some time in 2023, the radioactive exclusion zone also becomes infested with mutant spiders.\n|2022+\n|\n* No: 2022\n* Yes: 2023 or later\n|\n* No: 2022 ('''Stop''')\n* Yes: 2023 or later ('''Stop''')\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A very complicated flow chart, which can only be read in detail using the larger image now shown at the top of this page. This transcript uses the large version, which is more legible.]\n\n:[At the top of the chart there is a large caption, with a smaller caption below:]\n:<big>Guide to figuring out the age of an undated world map</big>\n:<small>(Assuming it's complete, labeled in English, and detailed enough)</small>\n\n:[Below the starting bracket in the small caption is a start box. It has rounded corners and it is gray with white text. From this box there is a gray line to a box consisting of a black frame with rounded corners. In these kind of boxes there are questions regarding the map in black text. Below this box there are three gray boxes like the start box, superimposed over the bottom frame. In these boxes are the possible answers to the question in the frame above. From each of these options there is a gray line going to similar black framed boxes with other questions either below, or to either side. There can either be two, three or four gray boxes, two the most common. Only at the very bottom of the central branch where it turns out it was a home made map, are there two frames with only one gray question box each. This trend continues over this entire large image. When reaching the end of a branch in the flow chart, there is no line away from one, more or all of the gray boxes for a black frame. When this happens a year range or a guess at what the map shows, or what it is (if it turns out to not be a map) is written below the gray box in gray text. Of the text in the gray boxes are Yes/No, but not always. There are 74 boxes with black frames with 158 gray boxes and 78 endpoints with text below the gray box and one end point without text below (the one with the home made map).]\n\n:Start\n::Istanbul or
