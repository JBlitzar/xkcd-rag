You took my hat!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThis comic is a direct sequel to [[374: Journal]], where [[Black Hat]] discusses his plan exactly as [[Danish]] describes it here, that is, he intends to display signs of interest in order to flatter a stranger only to hurt her by rejecting her when she responds.  In this case, the plan ricochets when Danish recognizes his plan before he has a chance to implement it.\n\nBlack Hat's tendency to act in enigmatic, and at times sociopathic, ways serves to give him a sense of superiority while at the same time keeping others distant enough that they can't hurt him. Danish not only recognizes that, she also calls him out on it. She recognizes his secret longing for connection to another, a connection that she could give should she choose to do so. Instead, she uses a more disingenuous version of his own ploy by laying bare his intentions and his desires before stripping him of his hat and confidence and herself from his life.\n\nDanish proves she is equal to — or possibly even better than — Black Hat. His hat is an adumbration of his sociopathy and possibly a realisation that, in the completely hypothetical situation that Black Hat is just a character in a webcomic, no one would recognize him without his black hat.\n\nThe jarred Black Hat can bring his vast intellectual powers to say nothing more to an already-decamped Danish than “That’s my hat! You took my hat!”, making Danish far better at hurting others' feelings.\n\nThe whole \"[[:Category:Journal|Journal]]\" story is:\n*[[374: Journal]]\n*[[377: Journal 2]]\n*[[405: Journal 3]]\n*[[432: Journal 4]]\n*[[433: Journal 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Danish are sitting in a train across from each other.
