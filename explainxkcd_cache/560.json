In the last few years, this has become a problem.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall]] muses that his life would have been better if he aged in reverse; this idea is based on a timeline of the usage of {{w|Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries}}. The reasoning is that each of these uses would come to realization when he most needed it; cheap {{w|RC planes}} as a child, a cellphone when he is a teenager and also later for when he is a successful businessman and finally a pacemaker when he is old. \n\nThe time-reversed aging is probably a direct reference to \"{{w|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button}}\", by {{w|F. Scott Fitzgerald}}, a film of which was released in December 2008, a few months before this comic appeared.  Randall has used this theme before in [[270: Merlin]], referencing another backward-time-traveling character (in that case, from \"{{w|The Once and Future King}}\" by {{w|T. H. White}}).\n\nLithium-ion batteries have the highest energy density of any widely available battery, and for this reason are commonly used in portable electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones, and also the newest airliners such as the {{w|Boeing 787 Dreamliner}}.\n\nIn the title text, Randall states that he is a big fan of cheap {{w|radio-controlled aircraft}} (now powered by cheap lithium-ion batteries), which he most likely wishes would have been available when he was a child. That these have now become so cheap has undoubtedly been the inspiration for this comic. \n\nAs such, he has an uncontrollable, instinctive urge to make up for his childhood lack of RC aircraft by buying every one he sees compulsively, if they cost less than $30, in spite of him normally being a frugal person. ({{w|Frugality}} has been defined as the tendency to acquire goods and services in a restrained manner). This tendency has now become a financial problem since cheap RC aircraft have become more and more plentiful, whereas if Randall aged backwards, this wouldn't be an issue - as children rarely make purchases, and adult Randall would live in a world where RCs were still expensive. The one in the comic is priced at only $10.\n\nThe concept of experiencing events in reverse is also explored in [[1869: Positive and Negative Reviews]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the timeline:]\n:Timeline of commercial uses of lithium batteries:\n\n:[The panel has a timeline that goes from past to present.
