'Because I'm coming TOWARD you!'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn {{w|structural geology}}, {{w|subduction}} is the mechanism by which one {{w|tectonic plate}} disappears under another over tens to hundreds of millions of years. This process usually creates a {{w|mountain range}} on the second tectonic plate as it starts to ride over the first and the surface geology is rucked and folded upwards. Also, water entrained in the subducting plate may rise into the second plate and provoke {{w|volcanism}}, often resulting in a {{w|volcanic arc}}.\n\nIn this comic, [[Beret Guy]] is very happy because he has just received his ''subduction license'', which may be a play on the business term ''{{w|licensed production|production license}}''. His roommate [[Cueball]] very reasonably asks him: ''Your what?'' But instead of answering him, Beret Guy begins to move towards him in their small room. It turns out that the license has literally enabled him to initiate subduction, seemingly at any point of his choosing and at anomalously high speed, or else allowed him to perform an existing ability he had not previously felt he could legally use. As he slides slightly towards Cueball, he slowly sinks under the floorboards of the room, and in the process creates a small mountain range on the floor. In the end, much to Cueball's consternation, these mountains turn his desk and chair over. Cueball physically falls out of the frame in the final panel, while Beret Guy is already halfway down beneath the floor. This would not be possible in real life.{{cn}}\n\nThe title text plays on the double meaning of the word \"normal\", which Cueball means in the sense of \"like most people, not strange,\" but which Beret Guy interprets in the geological sense. While subduction occurs when two plates crash into each other, a {{w|normal fault}} occurs when a surface block moves downward relative to an adjacent underlying block. Such faults were called \"normal\" because in English coal mining, they were the most common.\n\nA similarly atypical license was mentioned previously in [[410: Math Paper]]. Puns on geological terms (including types of faults) were previously made in [[1082: Geology]].\n\nThis comic was featured in a page of [[Thing Explainer]] as part of the explanation of the ''Big flat rocks we live on''. Only the last three panels were used, probably because the words in the first panel were way too uncommon for the book - see more details [[Thing_Explainer#References_to_comics|here]].\n\nWhereas the humor in this comic stems from Beret Guy's absurd ability to <em>initiate</em> subduction, that of [[3078: Anchor Bolts]] arises from an absurd proposal to ''suppress'' it. Subduction has also been mentioned in [[1829: Geochronology]] and in the title text of [[3021: Seismologists]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy is looking at some mail he has received while Cueball is at his computer desk at the other side of the room.]\n:Beret Guy: Sweet! I finally got my subduction license!\n:Cueball: Your what?\n\n:[Beret Guy starts sinking into the ground, causing it to ripple.]\n:Cueball: ...What are you doing?\n\n:[Beret Guy sinks further, forming a miniature mountain range in front of him. Cueball is frantically trying to keep his computer steady as his desk tilts.]\n:Cueball: ''Stop it! Stop it!''\n\n:[Beret Guy is waist-deep, and snow caps have formed on the mountains. Cueball is falling backwards from his desk and out of his chair, and the monitor unplugs itself from his computer.]\n:Cueball: ''Augh!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Subduction]]"
