It points out that many such products will go out of their way to market themselves as legitimate and cutting-edge by using impressive-sounding scientific terms, yet fail to perform even the most basic part of actual science: running a randomized controlled trial to determine results. When [[Cueball]] points this out, [[White Hat]] reacts as though this process is unreasonably complicated, which clearly demonstrates that his product is either nonsensical or an active scam (or both).\n\n{{w|Enzymes}} are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. For example, certain proteins aid digestion by breaking down large molecules. Nanoenzymes are synthetic materials that perform similar functions to ordinary enzymes. While enzymes are, indeed, necessary to healthy functioning of the body, adding more enzymes is typically not helpful for a healthy person. In cases where someone has a deficiency in specific enzymes, diagnosing such a system and designing a treatment would be a complex medical process, not something that could likely be delivered through a commercial drink. {{w|Amino acids}} are the chemicals that make up proteins, and therefore all natural enzymes are made from amino acids. Using such redundant but technical-sounding terms is a common practice in pseudoscience, as they hope to impress and bewilder laypeople by presenting themselves as scientifically skilled. \n\t\nCueball responds to this by asking if White Hat had given the drink to people to see if they got sick less often. While this is clearly very simplified, it is a good basic description of the scientific method. If the product is claimed to \"fight infections\", then one would need to compare groups of people who do and do not use the product, and determine whether there's a significant difference in how well they resist or recover from infections. A scientifically rigorous process would involve creating a set of criteria, recruiting subjects, randomly assigning them to control groups versus test groups, administering the product (preferably using placebos for control and a double-blind procedure), and tracking the health of each group. And, of course, keeping good records and analyzing the data properly would be critical to forming any conclusions. \n\nWhite Hat's response to this suggestion implies that he's completely unfamiliar with even the concept of such a study, commenting only that it \"sounds way too complicated.\" The title text shows him speculating as to how one would keep track of such data, and he suggests using \"like, Excel or something.\" {{w|Microsoft Excel}} is a popular spreadsheet application which is commonly used to store data, but is not designed as a database, and wouldn't be appropriate for a rigorous study. Since Excel is commonly used by the general public, claim that such rudimentary data storage is \"far too fancy\" for him reinforces his total lack of technical knowledge. He then calls himself a \"simple, country nanoenzyme developer\", which highlights the conflict between presenting himself as highly versed in cutting-edge science and not understanding the basics of how science works. All of which implies that his technical descriptions are actually nonsense, designed to fool the credulous. \n\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat holding a bottle and standing next to Cueball]\n:White Hat: My new health drink is packed with amino acid nanoenzymes that I designed to train your immune system to fight infections!\n:Cueball: Can you give it to some people and see if they get sick less often?\n:White Hat: Whoa, that sounds '''''way''''' too complicated.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]"
