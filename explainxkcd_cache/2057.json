I wonder if today's the day we find out about it.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThis comic explores some seemingly strange perspectives that academics or professionals might have due to their deeper knowledge and understanding of the fields that they study.\n\nMany seemingly mundane phenomena can actually be quite weird or counterintuitive if you understand how they really work. The five people featured in this comic, all from different disciplines, are all aware of certain facts about reality that seem so strange even they have trouble believing they are true; yet, undeniably, they are.\n\n* [[Megan]], a {{w|botanist}}, is struck by the fact that trees are made in large part from air, as in the carbon dioxide they consume.\n* [[Cueball]], a {{w|physicist}}, finds it weird that he can feel the gravity between an object in his hand (his phone) and the Earth. This is [[725: Literally|literally]] just the weight of the phone.\n* [[Blondie]], a computer security researcher, knows of the inherent insecurity of computer systems and wonders if today is the day everyone will get hacked, collapsing our society.\n* [[Hairy]], a {{w|graphic designer}}, wonders what sequence of events drove a store's decision to use a particular recognizable font for their signage.\n* [[Ponytail]], studying medicine, wonders how humans manage to seem so normal on the outside, given that most of their bodies are made up of things usually unmentionable.\n\nFour of the five people are pondering things that they happen to find very interesting but that aren't too concerning to an everyday person, whereas what Blondie is pondering could have widespread or even global effects on our way of life. In the title text, Blondie amends her thought, since she actually knows an even more concerning truth: we've ''already'' all been hacked, and we just don't know it yet.\n\nBelow, the people's thoughts are explained in detail.\n\n;Botany\nAlmost the entire mass of a tree is made of atoms which are extracted from the air. Trees (like all photosynthetic plants) grow by extracting carbon dioxide from the air and water and nutrients from the soil and chemically recombining the atoms to form large, organic molecules (such as {{w|cellulose}}) which is then used to build the their structure. In this sense, trees can be said to be \"made of\" air and water. And since the water generally comes from rain which condensed from water vapor in the air, that means that air contains nearly everything that's used to form a tree's structure. \n\nThis is counterintuitive, since trees are generally heavy, dense and solid objects, which seem fundamentally different from the air around us, which we often don't even notice. But such conversion between different types of matter is common in chemistry. \n\n;Physics\n{{w|Gravity}} is the weakest of the four {{w|Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces}} in physics but also to humans the most preeminent one. In everyday experience, most people tend to think of gravity merely as a pervasive downward force, but as a physicist, Cueball is more aware that in fact, all gravitational forces are mutual; any pair of objects will exert a gravitational force on each other, regardless of how big they are. Therefore, when he feels the weight of the phone in his hand, he understands that what he's actually feeling is the net attractive force between the phone and the planet, both of them pulling towards the other with enough force that a human can easily detect it. \n\n;Computer Security\nAnyone well versed in computer security understands just how insecure the systems that we depend on actually are.\n\nIn the title text it is noted that possibly all our systems are already hacked, and we just haven't found out yet. Since malicious hackers do their work covertly, a successful hack often isn't discovered until days, weeks, or even years later if at all.  By that time they may have successfully hacked many other systems using the same techniques and/or exploiting the same widely unknown or un-patched security flaws.  Some high profile hacks recently discovered at the time of this posting include a [https://securitytoday.com/articles/2018/10/02/facebook-hacked-50-million-users-data-exposed.aspx 50-million user hack of Facebook] and Google+ announcing they are [https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/ shutting down the consumer side of Google+], in part due to a security flaw that was discovered and patched months ago.\n\n;Graphic Design\n{{w|Graphic designer}}s recognize fonts and design elements, and see how they come together. In this comic, the graphic designer wonders how the ''{{w|Law & Order}}'' font was chosen for a particular storefront's sign. ''Law & Order'' is a police procedural TV series created by Dick Wolf in 1990, which has had various spinoffs. The font used for the title sequence of ''Law & Order'' is called {{w|Friz Quadrata}}, and is also the font used for the signage of the New York Police Department headquarters.\n\n;Medicine\nDoctors are well versed in {{w|human anatomy}}, and are likely to think about what is inside of people more than the average person would. The things that are inside our bodies tend to cause a visceral reaction when we're exposed to them. As a result, most people tend not to think about them most of the time, and think of people in the terms that we're used to: seeing and experiencing only the exterior. Most people are aware, in theory, that blood, bones, feces, and other things that we find disgusting, are inside us (and the people around us), but very rarely connect that reality with our everyday reactions to them. \n\nDoctors are not only particularly familiar with what goes on inside people, but likely have to deal with it on a regular basis, and may have to frequently see what's going on inside people. In consequence, it may be harder for them to ignore the biological reality of the people around them, as they're intimately familiar of what's going on inside everyone at any given time. \n\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Beneath a two line caption are five characters shown, with their thoughts inside thought bubbles.
