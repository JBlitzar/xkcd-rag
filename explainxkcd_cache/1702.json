They're found across the American south and great plains, so the best home remedy is to move to Iceland.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Bug bites}}, such as mosquito bites, are itchy. Home remedies are often ineffective, and in some cases very complicated - think of the number of suggestions on how to cure hiccups. In this case [[Cueball]]'s suggestion starts out plausible but rapidly gets increasingly and insanely complicated, involving finding rare French orchids. [[Megan]] is not actually interested in trying out a complex home remedy, she really just wants sympathy.\n\nThe suggested remedy is a mix of many popular home remedies such as:\n*Taking a hot shower: supposed to stimulate nerve endings, it can also destroy some toxins.\n*Applying {{w|vinegar}}: supposedly effective on mosquito bites.\n*Applying ice: numbs the pain, more commonly used on bruises.\n*Using {{w|aspirin}}: as an anti-inflammatory drug aspirin may have an effect on itches, although it may cause more itches than provide relief.\n*Tea and a \"rare French orchid\": {{w|orchids}}, like many other plants, are commonly used in traditional medicine to cure various ailments, and tea is a common route of administration.\n\nMegan's answer is a {{w|sarcastic}} comment stating that her own family home remedy is to keep scratching until the skin falls off -- which is a natural tendency, although not until the skin literally falls off; hence it is not really a home remedy, just a natural reaction.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|chigger|chiggers}} or {{w|Trombicula alfreddugesi}} as the worst source for itches; in fact only in the larval stages are these mites parasitic. ''Chigger'' can also refer to the chigoe flea or \"jigger\", {{w|Tunga penetrans}}, a parasitic flea which also causes bad itching, but [[Randall]] explicitly mentions the mite ''Trombicula alfreddugesi''. A move to a more northerly region of the world like Iceland might seem to be a perfect cure, because those parasites are only found in warmer southern regions (similarly, since mosquitoes lay their eggs in water, moving to a dry place with no water usable by mosquitoes would be a \"cure\" for mosquito bites). Unusually, [http://icelandreview.com/news/2013/06/27/no-mosquitoes-iceland-puzzles-scientists Iceland does not support native mosquitoes, despite similarities to other northern regions which do.] One might fallaciously assume it does not support parasites in general &mdash; but it [https://books.google.com/books?id=I4pD5t_y05YC ''does''] support parasitic insects in other genera, and it has other species of mites.  Thus, \"move to Iceland\" is a weird home remedy that will work if the person wants to prevent chiggers, however it won't work if the person wants to stay away from all parasites.\n\nThis comic could be seen as a continuation of the title text from [[1693: Oxidation]], where that is interpreted as Ponytail ineffectively reassuring Megan that her bug bites should not be a concern.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball stand together while Megan loudly scratches her itches and Cueball holds a hand up.]\n:Megan: Argh, bug bites are the ''worst''. I shouldn't scratch, but... so itchy.\n:Cueball: Oh, you know what's great for that?\n:''Scratch scratch''\n\n:[Zoom-in to Megan's head.]\n:Megan: No, don't tell me. Everyone always has weird home remedies that never work. I just want sympathy.\n:Cueball (off-panel): No, this one isn't weird, I promise. It really helps!\n\n:[A frame less panel with a zoom-out back to Megan and Cueball. Megan is still scratching loudly and Cueball still holds his hand up.]\n:Cueball: First, take a hot shower. Then dip some ice cubes in vinegar and use them to crush one baby aspirin. Then make some tea, and...\n:''Scratch scratch''\n\n:[Megan walks past Cueball and away from him while Cueball turns and looks after her.]\n:Cueball: ...then, you need a rare French orchid-\n:Megan: I'm going to try a different home remedy where I complain a lot and scratch until my skin comes off.\n:Cueball: Sounds effective.\n:Megan: It's an old family trick.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
