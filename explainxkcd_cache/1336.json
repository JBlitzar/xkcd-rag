Transformers typically are able to transform instantaneously, often mid-stride, by manipulating and rearranging their mechanical parts. In this comic, however, [[Randall]] has the Transformers \"transform\" in the same manner that {{w|Caterpillar|caterpillars}} \"transform\" via {{w|metamorphosis}} into butterflies or moths.\n\nThe first two panels show action scenes that would be appropriate for a Transformers comic. However, the third panel shows the Transformers climbing a tree, and in the final scene they wrap silk around themselves, apparently forming a cocoon or chrysalis.\n\nThe title text furthers this parallel, describing a newly transformed helicopter — presumably the post-metamorphosis state of one of the Transformers in the panels — in a manner that would be more appropriate for a freshly-emerged butterfly or moth.\n\nThis [[xkcd]] comic is one of the few ones not showing just simple [[stick figure]]s.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two \"Transformer\"-esque robots are visible.]\n:First Robot: '''''Transform!'''''\n:[Both robots run to the right.]\n:[Each robot reaches a tree and begins to climb it.]\n:[The camera focuses on the nearer of the two robots, which is placing itself into a chrysalis hanging from the tree branch.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Robots]]"
