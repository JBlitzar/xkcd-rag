This is not the case in the comic: [[Cueball]] is in fact simply showing random slides that have no connection to each other. By using the phrase liberally and never actually explaining the links, it is suggested that a presenter can simply continue to show random slides for an extended period before anyone actually realizes what is going on.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|SIGGRAPH}}, an annual computer graphics conference held since 1974. In [[541: TED Talk]], it is said that [[Randall]] has been banned from SIGGRAPH, and we can infer from this comic that he was physically thrown out of it. Another (very implausible) possibility is that Randall is making the joke that people who attend computer graphics conferences are stereotypically not very athletic, and therefore unlikely to be able to physically throw someone.\n\nIn addition, the fact that Cueball was attending SIGGRAPH is another joke: Cueball seems to have misinterpreted the conference name and shown a random assortment of graphs. In reality, SIGGRAPH focuses on computer graphics, not graphs. Neither the {{w|Quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall effect}}, a concept in quantum mechanics, nor rainfall in the Amazon forest, are on-topic for it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing on a stage, pointing at a line graph using a pointer.]\n:Cueball: That chart explained the quantum Hall effect. Now, if you'll bear with me a moment, this next graph shows rainfall over the amazon basin...\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:If you keep saying \"bear with me for a moment\" people will take a while to figure out that you're just showing them random slides.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Banned from conferences]]"
