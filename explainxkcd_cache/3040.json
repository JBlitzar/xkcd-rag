Cueball mispronounces {{w|carboxylic acid}}s by reading their chemical formulas as phonetic words rather than giving any of their more proper chemical names. In the structural diagrams, also shown, there is an incorrect fifth bond between carbon and the OH-group just in the first of the molecules. Whether done by [[Randall]] intentionally, or otherwise, this would add to chemists' annoyance.\n\nThe first molecule, \"HCOOH\" is pronounced as \"hakoo\"; it is commonly known as {{w|formic acid}} (named after the {{w|Formicinae#Identification|ants}} which are known to produce it), but with the more systematic name of methanoic acid (due to being the carboxylic acid structured upon a single-carbon {{w|methane}} 'backbone'). The second, \"CH<sub>3</sub>COOH\" becomes \"chuckoo\", rather than either its systematic name of ethanoic acid (this time having a two-carbon {{w|ethane}} backbone, with the acid structure at one end) or the more common name of {{w|acetic acid}} (derived from the greek for vinegar, as this is the core constituent of traditional vinegar and its {{w|non-brewed condiment}} equivalent). This deliberate mispronunciation follows a similar pattern to [[2492: Commonly Mispronounced Equations]].\n\nThe title text extends the joke with \"Can you pass the nackle,\" where \"nackle\" is a phonetic pronunciation of \"NaCl\" ({{w|sodium chloride}}), the primary component of {{w|table salt}} and {{w|rock salt}}. Unlike other chemical formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O (\"{{wiktionary|hoe}}\") or CO<sub>2</sub> (\"{{wiktionary|co-}}\"), \"nackle\" is distinctive enough to be recognizable and is [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nackle actually used jokingly].\n\nThe request for \"nackle\" could be interpreted either as a genuine request for the {{w|condiment}} or as a [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pass%20the%20salt sarcastic response] to someone's reaction to the initial joke - something to take with {{w|a grain of salt}}, er, nackle. The ambiguity is heightened by not knowing who makes the title text comment. Also, [[2752: Salt Dome|passing the salt has been mentioned in xkcd before]].\n\nIncidentally, three Pokémon in ''Scarlet and Violet'' contain \"nacl\" in their names: [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nacli_(Pokémon) Nacli], [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Naclstack_(Pokémon) Naclstack], and [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Garganacl_(Pokémon) Garganacl], all being rock salt-based creatures. This naming scheme shows how the pronunciation of chemical formulas as words has entered popular culture beyond just chemistry jokes.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball is holding a pointer and gesturing towards a whiteboard that shows the chemical formulas HCOOH and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH. Below these, respectively, are classic diagramatic representations of formic/methanoic acid (with an apparently accidental doubled bond between the carbon and the hydroxy group) and acetic/ethanoic acid; being, in turn, a single- and double-carbon chain molecule with a double-bonded oxygen (carbonyl group) plus an oxygen-hydrogen (hydroxy) upon one carbon of each, to form the full carboxyl grouping, and hydrogens completing all other expected bonds. An emphatic off-panel voice comes from the right where Cueball is facing.]\n:Cueball: The two simplest carboxylic acids are hakoo and chuckoo.\n:Off-panel voice: '''''No!!'''''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:How to annoy chemists\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:How to annoy]]"
