More specifically, ''4'33\"'' consists entirely of faint ambient sounds coming from the environment, while all the players silently hold their instruments. The noise of the audience is considered part of the composition. It is Cage's most famous work, and the subject of many music jokes. Note that John Cage wrote plenty of other non-silent things.\n\n[[Megan]] is using an app on her smartphone that analyzes music that is playing and uses an online database to figure out what it is; popular real-world examples include {{w|Shazam (service)|Shazam}} and {{w|SoundHound}}. She does this in an empty room, correctly matching ''4'33\"''. [[Cueball]] attempted to use the same app in [[1192: Humming]], but Megan hacked it there.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that since ''4'33\"'' is composed of the ambient sounds in an environment, if that environment is a recording studio, live music venue etc. the ambient sound is a band playing another song.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is walking with a phone in her hand.]\n\n:[Megan stops.]\n\n:[Megan raises her phone.]\n:Phone: Identify song recorded\n:Phone: > LIVE [Beta]\n\n:[Megan is in an empty room.]\n:Phone: Listening...\n\n:[The phone screen.]\n:Positive match:\n:'''4'33\"'''\n:'''John Cage'''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
