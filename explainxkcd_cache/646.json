So when dysentery was more prevalent, people spent more time on the toilet and presumably would have to talk to other people while sitting there. Dysentery has largely subsided in the developed world, which is why the graph of dysentery cases falls to near zero over time.\n\nLaptops could cause toilet conversations because {{w|wireless internet}} allows people to carry their laptop anywhere around the house, even to the bathroom. They can still communicate with friends by text, voice, or even video chat, which means people can multitask by holding an online conversation while sitting on the toilet. If the chatting is just in text, then the other person won't have to know that their friend is on the toilet - Hopefully voice and video chat are less common while sitting on the toilet.\n\nThere are always ''some'' conversations on the toilet, because the social conventions against it are sometimes ignored or overridden by urgent situations. This explains why the conversations graph does not reach zero in the middle.\n\nThe joke in the title text is a direct reference to a previous [[623|comic]] regarding {{w|The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game)|The Oregon Trail}} and dysentery.\n\nThe title text refers to the popular educational computer game around the 1980s titled the Oregon Trail. The game purports to educate students about 19th-century {{w|pioneer}} life on the {{w|Oregon Trail}} in the western {{w|United States}}. Among the features in the game is the common occurrence for a party member to die of a disease such as {{w|cholera}}, {{w|typhoid}}, or {{w|dysentery}}. The title text humorously suggests that the data for the graph comes from occurrences of dysentery in the game.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph plots time vs. 3 lines.]\n:[Dysentery cases starts high, drops to near zero with time.]\n:[Laptop sales starts at zero, then raises.]\n:[Frequency of conversations in which one participant is on the toilet - falls as dysentery cases falls, then rises again with laptop sales.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Line graphs]]"
