I can tell by the pixels that we're wrong for each other.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is another comic in the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby series]]. This whole comic, including the title text, is a play on the then-popular {{w|internet meme}} \"[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-looks-shopped This Looks Shopped]\". It may also be making fun of how everything and anything you find on the internet has someone insisting that it's 'fake' or 'photoshopped', regardless of whether it's true in actuality. {{w|Adobe Photoshop}} is a popular {{w|Graphics software|image manipulation tool}} used to manipulate photographic images and for drawing. Of course, Photoshop and similar tools like Paint Shop Pro can only be used for imagery, not for real life objects.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text contains the second part of the internet meme, the complete text of which is: \"THIS LOOKS SHOPPED / I CAN TELL FROM SOME OF THE PIXELS AND FROM SEEING QUITE A FEW SHOPS IN MY TIME.\" {{w|JPEG}} is an image compression algorithm that works by finding frequencies in blocks of 8x8 pixels and saving that instead of the original pixels. This works remarkably well, but sometimes leaves artifacts that can be seen when zooming in enough. The iris of an eye contains all kinds of odd colored spots - and there's not a JPEG algorithm in sight.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan holds a sword while Cueball looks on.]\n:My hobby: Insisting that real-life objects are photoshopped.\n:Megan: This sabre is a 19th-century family heirloom.\n:Cueball: It looks photoshopped.\n:Megan: Huh?\n:Cueball: Yeah, the reflections are all wrong.
