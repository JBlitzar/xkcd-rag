It was published six days after the 2020 election took place, and two days after {{w|Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference|most news networks \"called\" the election}}, projecting Biden as the winner. The majority of the comic's panels are duplicates from 1122, with the exception of the 2012 panel (modified to show that Obama did in fact break the streak), the 2016 panel (added to reflect the election of Donald Trump), and the two 2020 panels. It continues the theme of pointing out that an arbitrary 'precedent' can always be invoked to predict the outcome of an election. Presidential elections happen rarely enough that each is a unique event, and ''something'' is always happening for the first time. Like with the other examples, the precedents mentioned here mix factors that could plausibly impact the election (such as one candidate having been impeached), with precedents that are just a product of time and chance (like a successful challenger having a website).\n\nThe final two panels again show how, no matter which candidate won in 2020, it would be a 'first' in some way.\n* No sitting president who was impeached was even nominated for the office again until Donald Trump. (Only two other US presidents have been impeached. Bill Clinton couldn't run again afterward due to term limits, Andrew Johnson failed to be nominated at the 1868 Democratic Convention.) Until the 2024 election, it remained true that no impeached president has ever been re-elected. After Trump's 2024 election victory, it now depends on whether you count the phrase \"No President\" to only apply to sitting presidents. \n* Prior to the 2020 election, no challenger with a website ever won. This, however, is easily explained by the fact that incumbent presidents usually win, and websites are a fairly new technology. The last time a challenger beat an incumbent was in 1992 before Internet use was widespread. By 1996 that had changed and both the incumbent [http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/websites/cg96/ Bill Clinton campaign] and the challenger [http://www.dolekemp96.org/main.htm Bob Dole campaign] had websites that look very simple by today's standards. The title text points out that one could just as easily say that incumbents with websites are unbeatable, until that precedent was broken in 2020.\n\nThe 2020 election was also precedent breaking in a few ways that Randall didn't mention:\n* At 78, [[Joe Biden]] was the oldest president ever on the day of his inauguration.\n* Biden's running mate Kamala Harris is the first-ever female vice president, first Black vice president, and the first Asian vice president (her parents are from Jamaica and India). She's also the first Democratic vice president from the West.\n* Biden received over 80 million votes, the highest ever, beating Obama 2008's previous record of just under 69.5 million votes. The second-highest raw vote total was for Trump, with approximately 74.2 million votes, ''also'' beating Obama 2008. Turnout as a percentage of the eligible population was the highest in over a century. Unlike the other precedents, however, this one was not an inevitable outcome of a Biden-Harris victory.\n\nAlso, Biden is the first president from the state of Delaware, thus he broke the \"precedent\" that Delawareans can't win. Randall then proceeds to combine these 2 facts to create a new precedent: Only Delawareans can defeat incumbents with a website.\n\nAll the way up to the 2024 election, no president had ever been re-elected after being impeached. There were only ever three official impeachments, with Nixon facing \"inquiries\", but given that a president would have to very badly mess up (such as having an affair with a secretary or bugging high ranking officals offices) it would be thought extremly unlikely that the public would support such an individual should they seek to rerun for office, and he indeed failed to do so in 2020. However, even though Donald Trump had faced an impeachment (and now also possible jail time, for separate issues), he subsequently won with a majority of vote in 2024.\n\nHad this exact same test been proposed again in the next election, in view of the same candidate, it would have proven untrue once President-Elect Donald Trump broke that particular impeachment 'curse'. There was no actual attempt to (re)establish this hurdle in the run-up to the 2024 cycle, nor was it ever mentioned which barrier it might have been that his opponent did ''not'' overcome.\n\n==Table of New Broken Precedents==\n\nAll original options can be found at [[1122: Electoral Precedent]].\n\n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=5 class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
