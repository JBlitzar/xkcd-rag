Then the second to last panel starts a feeling that it might be going wrong, and then the very last panel reveals that [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are actually going through some relationship trouble, because Cueball uses her presence as a good reason for leaving this world behind. He does, however, not intend to commit suicide to escape from her and the world; he just wishes to escape by falling asleep (either that, or it's a double-meaning joke based on the fact that he's about to fall out of the bed).\n\nAs the title text reveals, he also wishes to avoid her in his dreams, as he wishes their dreams do not intersect - i.e. he hopes he will not dream of her (and vice versa). The opposite of \"I'll see you in my dreams\".\n\nThe cartoon seems to be a homage to the webcomic [http://www.asofterworld.com/ a softer world], which takes the same format.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball gets into bed.]\n:It's so much easier\n:falling asleep\n\n:[Megan is lying in bed, gripping her pillow.]\n:With you beside meâ€”\n\n:[Cueball is lying on his back in bed.]\n:All the incentive I need\n\n:[Full shot of the bed, Megan is on the left, gripping the pillow, Cueball is as far to the right as possible, nearly falling off, facing away from her.]\n:To leave the world behind.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
