The comic features people discussing a fictional monster which - apparently - can be only described by these overused comparisons. The three used by [[Megan]], [[Cueball]] and [[Ponytail]] are:\n*The monster is as long as a football field. This is most likely an {{w|American_football#Field_and_equipment|American football field}} (given the author is American). So the monster is about 120 yards/110 m long.\n**Here is an {{w|Marco Polo Park|example from Wikipedia}} where a building is compared to the length of a football field.\n*The monster runs as fast as a cheetah, at least 60 mph or 96 kmh.\n**The {{w|cheetah}} is famous for being the fastest land animal at full sprint. Like the monster, the cheetah is prone to comparisons: to cars, since 60 mph is a common highway speed limit. Unlike a cheetah, however, the monster's speed is almost certainly thanks to its large stride.\n*The monster is as heavy as a {{w|blue whale}} (about 180 tonnes).\n**Here is an [http://factismals.com/tag/fish/ example] where the weight of a blue whale is used in two different comparison (something heavier and something lighter).\n*Finally it is stated that it has the intelligence of a two-year-old child. Comparing someone's intelligence to a child of a given age is very common.\n**Here is an [http://www.livescience.com/5613-dogs-smart-2-year-kids.html example] where a dog is compared to a two year old kid.\n**There is even an xkcd comic that is referring to this age IQ: [[1364: Like I'm Five]].\n\nThe caption below the panel names the monster the ''Frequently-Made Comparisons Monster'', joking that the monster was created by comparing it to things, and continues the joke by comparing the number of killed people to those that could fill a (sports) stadium (of the order tens of thousands), and the area of devastation to the smallest state in the US {{w|Rhode Island}} It is also possible that the monster actually attacked a stadium full of people, and only devastated Rhode Island, similar to the title text.(1,214&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi/3,140&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) (a state Randall also used for comparison in the What if? [http://what-if.xkcd.com/8/ Everybody Jump]. In another What if? he uses a football stadium filled with ants as a comparison: [https://what-if.xkcd.com/73/ Lethal Neutrinos].)\n\nThe title text takes the joke one step further by comparing the {{w|nuclear bomb}} used to destroy the monster to {{w|Little Boy|the bomb dropped on Hiroshima}} at the end of the Second World War, i.e. they dropped a relatively small nuclear bomb on it (nuclear weapons have advanced significantly since WWII). Here is an {{w|Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event#Effects of impact|example from Wikipedia}} of such a comparison with the strength of a meteor strike.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four people are standing around a table-top crisis planning model.
