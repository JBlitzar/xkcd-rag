It was among the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen comics]] posted to LiveJournal within 12 minutes on September 30, 2005, on the first day of the xkcd LiveJournal account.\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic depicts a girl sleeping on the floor of [[Randall]]'s 11th-grade Spanish class, presumably during a movie as shown in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001941/http://xkcd-drawings.livejournal.com/?skip=40#:~:text=8%3A34%20pm-,Girl%20sleeping,-I%20drew%20this original caption]. The title text on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] explains that Randall didn't know her name, but she was sleeping on the floor, and so he decided to draw her. It is possible that Randall found the girl attractive, which would have motivated him to draw her.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Girl sleeping on her side, head to the left, facing away from view.]\n\n==Trivia==\n*This is the first comic drawn on [[:Category:Checkered paper|checkered paper]].\n*This drawing would be used again in [[1506: xkcloud]] as one of the \"[[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help!
