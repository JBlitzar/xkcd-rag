As with most historical markers, it claims to rest on the exact spot of the event, that the Earth formed in this specific location. It also specifies the Earth's formation to the precise year 4.45 billion ({{w|Long and short scales|4,450 million}}) BCE.\n\nThe absurdity of the sign is threefold:\n# The Earth did not form on its surface\n# The precise year of the Earth's formation is not knowable\n# Historical markers typically refer to events within the past several centuries\n\n'''#1: The Earth did not form on its surface'''\n\nFirst, the Earth formed at its center, not anywhere on its surface, so an “Earth formed here” sign on the surface is amusingly incorrect.\n\nOne may argue that technically the sign is ''above'' the right spot, just as every location on Earth is above the right spot. However, the sign refers to “this location,” not to a spot underground.\n\nIf an omniscient observer wanted to mark the spot in space where the Earth started forming, they would need an historical marker floating in space, not on the surface of the (moving) Earth. That’s due to the {{w|Sun#Motion|Sun's 225-million year long orbit around the center of the}} {{w|Milky Way galaxy}} and the movement of the galaxy itself through space relative to other objects.\n\n'''#2: The precise year of the Earth's formation is not knowable'''\n\nSecondly, specifying a single year of formation BCE (Before the Common Era) is an amusingly precise choice. It takes [https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/how-do-planets-form/ tens or hundreds of millions of years] for a planet to form. Picking a year would require some specific definition of when a gradually-coalescing mass of proto-planet dust and gas could be considered a planet, as well as the impossible ability to determine when that mass met the definition.\n\nIf the precise year was knowable, the probability of the number actually ending in seven consecutive zeros would be on the order of one-in-ten-million.\n\nThe topic of what precisely makes a planet — related to the 2006 redefinition of a planet and the subsequent reclassification of Pluto from the solar system's ninth planet to a dwarf planet — has been covered before in [[473: Still Raw]] and referenced in other XKCD comics.\n\nThere is some poetry in the idea that there was a precise year, some 4.45 billion years ago, that was the first true year, the first Earth orbit around the sun. By definition, the Earth is the same age as the number of Earth orbits that have ever taken place.\n\nNote: The date shown for the formation of the Earth, 4.45 billion years ago, also differs from the commonly accepted date, [https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html 4.54 (±0.05) billion years]. The difference lies in the transposition of two digits, 5 and 4, potentially a mistake, as is common in historical markers.\n\n'''#3: Historical markers typically refer to events within the past several centuries'''\n\nHistorical markers are placed at precise locations where historical, religious, and even mythological events are believed to have happened — such as where battles have been fought, or where famous people resided or accomplished something. Typically these signs refer to more recent events.\n\n'''Scientific inaccuracies'''\n\nContrary to what the comic suggests, the current scientific consensus is that the Earth did not form from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas. While the mechanism of the Earth's formation is an open area of research, the general idea is that first, the Sun formed from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas. The remaining dust and gas formed a disk around the Sun called the Sun's protoplanetary disk. From this disk, the planets formed. There is currently no consensus on the details of how this happened. But roughly speaking, dust particles in the Sun's protoplanetary disk collide and stick together until the resulting body is massive enough to slowly accrete matter through gravitation. So while the Sun formed from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas, the Earth did not.\n\nFurther reading: E.g. {{w|Pebble accretion}}, {{w|Streaming instability}}\n\n'''The title text'''\n\nThe title text refers to the 'exact latitude and longitude of the Earth's core,’ Of course, since the lat-long geographic coordinate system is used for locating places on the ''surface'' on the Earth, the center of the Earth does not have latitude and longitude.\n\nAlso, a historical marker referring to the Earth’s core could be placed anywhere on the surface, and its specific location in the real world wouldn’t mean anything; just as before, every spot on Earth is above the right spot.\n\nExamples of similar historical marker signs:\n* {{w|File:Equator sign kenya.jpg|Kenya Equator latitude}}\n* {{w|File:Arctic Circle sign.jpg|Arctic Circle latitude}}\n* {{w|File:Prime meridian.jpg|Prime Meridian longitude}}\n* {{w|File:2022-06-06 18 39 21 Sign reading \"Highest Point on Interstate 80 East of the Mississippi River\" along eastbound Interstate 80 (Keystone Shortway) just east of Exit 111 in Pine Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania.jpg|Highest Point}}\n* {{w|File:World's lowest point (1971).jpg|Lowest Point}}\n\n'''Analysis'''\n\nThe comic and its title text are actually inverse jokes of each other: The historical marker in the comic assigns an attribute of the Earth’s '''center''' (the site of formation) to a spot on its '''surface''', while the historical marker mentioned in the title text assigns an attribute of '''surface''' locations (latitude and longitude) to the Earth’s '''center'''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in front of a fancy, rectangular shaped sign in a field of grass. The sign has 4 stars on top in a small circular section with the words HISTORICAL MARKER underneath it. Rocks and plants are scattered across the ground. The sign reads:] \n:<big>EARTH</big>\n:FORMATION SITE\n:--- 4,450,000,000 BCE ---\n:At this location in the year 4,450,000,000 BCE, a cloud of dust and gas gravitationally collapsed to form the Earth.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Geology]]"
