(The original quotation was, \"I find your lack of faith disturbing.\")\n\nThere is humor in Megan's hypocrisy, however. Although she is disturbed by Cueball's unoriginal dialogue, she is fine with doing it herself. (It is possible, however, that she finds modifying a quote, rather than just repeating it verbatim, to be original enough.)\n\n''Star Wars'' fans are a weird bunch, however, and the title text states that if a ''Star Wars'' fan met a girl who could do this in real life, it'd only serve to turn him on even more.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Outside, under a crescent moon. Megan holds Cueball up in the air by his neck à la Darth Vader using the force.]\n:Megan: It's strange to stare at the moon and think about people walking on it.\n:Cueball: That's no moon, it's a—''*gack*''\n:Megan: I find your lack of original conversation disturbing.\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]"
