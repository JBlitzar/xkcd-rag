Just gotta figure out how to give it to them. Maybe I can cut it into pieces to make it easier to swallow...\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Megan]] has won an award at a ceremony (presumably movie-related and possibly an {{w|Academy Awards|Academy Award}}, as she mentions her director). When a person receives a major award, they give an acceptance speech which traditionally begins with the recipient thanking people who have helped them achieve the honor. Sometimes when a number of people are mentioned, the recipient will say that it was a team effort - a comment which elevates the \"helpers\" to virtually the same level as the recipient.\n\nMegan's acceptance speech takes things a step further; she thanks not only her director, family, and friends, but also the {{w|Microbiota|bacteria that populate her gastrointestinal tract.}} She states that the bacterial cells outnumber hers, likely referencing the misconception at the time that bacterial cells outnumber human cells by a factor of 10 to 1. More recent estimates have gotten values around 1:1. While the bacteria in the gut make digestion possible, the ecosystem formed by bacteria in the urogenital tract and on the skin also protect human health. In short, without them Megan would die — and not be able to win the award. To thank her bacteria is comparable to thanking her parents: they did not really contribute to the movie, but without them there would not have been a Megan, and no award.\n\nRecently, it has been shown that the gut bacteria has an effect on emotions, thoughts and mood. [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/can-the-bacteria-in-your-gut-explain-your-mood.html link]\n\nIn the title text, Megan contemplates ''how'' to thank her microorganisms and considers to eat the trophy after having it cut in pieces. This is an extremely bad idea, because it might kill both her and the microorganisms.\n\nA {{w|pint}} is a volume of about half a liter (specifically, the U.S. fluid version is 28 and 7/8 cu.in.).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is on a stage receiving an award from Ponytail, the latter of whom is standing behind a lectern.]\n:Megan: I'd like to thank my director, my friends and family, and–of course–the writhing mass of gut bacteria inside me.\n:Megan: I mean, there's like one or two pints of them in here; their cells outnumber mine!\n:Megan: Anyway, this was a real team effort.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]"
