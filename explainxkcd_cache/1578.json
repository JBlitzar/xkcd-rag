This is humorous because a living squirrel making a ringing sound is completely absurd, but when [[Cueball]] attempts to lean into this absurdity by answering, the comic subverts your expectations with the more realistic outcome of being bitten.\n\nThe sounds the squirrel makes correspond to the tones that the terminals make when you use the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) in the US:\n*When someone else calls you and the receiver of your phone is on the hook, the phone makes loud and long \"riiing riiiing\" tones. This is the case in the first frame of the comic.\n*If a phone is left off hook without use for too long (referenced in the title text), an {{w|off-hook tone}} is played. This is to alert anyone present that the phone is off-hook. In this case, you should hang up so that you can receive calls. Once on-hook, the receiver can be picked up again to dial. In this case, this means having the squirrel back on the stump.\n\n[[:Category:Squirrels|Squirrels]] are a recurring theme in xkcd. They also appear in ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'', where it has for instance been used as a cute animal to replace a drawing of something scary or unpleasant like in the articles ''[https://what-if.xkcd.com/98/ Blood Alcohol]'' or ''[https://what-if.xkcd.com/105/ Cannibalism]''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is approaching a stump with a squirrel perched on it.
