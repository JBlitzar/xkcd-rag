If you work very hard you can figure out who is who.\n}}\n\nThis was the tenth comic [[LiveJournal|originally posted to LiveJournal]]. The previous one was [[6: Irony]], and the next was [[10: Pi Equals]]. It was among the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen comics]] posted to LiveJournal within 12 minutes on September 30, 2005, on the first day of the xkcd LiveJournal account. \n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is about the release of the movie ''{{w|Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity}}'', which was the follow-up to {{w|Joss Whedon}}'s TV show, ''{{w|Firefly (TV series)|Firefly}}'', which was cancelled by {{w|Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox}} after only one season. Plus, three episodes were not shown on Fox but debuted on {{w|Sci Fi Channel}} in the UK. The show was followed by a devoted number of fans who were outraged by the cancellation of the show. High DVD sales and strong fan support allowed the follow-up film ''Serenity'' to be created, which tied up many of the loose ends that ''Firefly'' left open, such as the cause of {{w|List of Firefly characters#River Tam|River}}'s abilities and the origins of the {{w|Reaver (Firefly)|Reavers}}. [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Summer Glau]], and [[Jewel Staite]], the actors who play Mal, River, and Kaylee respectively, also show up later in Randall's series [[:Category:The Race|The Race]]. Randall is presumably excited about the upcoming film, and so has drawn the cast.\n\nThe image shows the main characters of Firefly. In the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001941/http://xkcd-drawings.livejournal.com/?skip=40#:~:text=8%3A43%20pm-,Firefly,-Drawn%20in%20honor original caption] for this comic, Randall initially left figuring out who is who as an exercise to the reader, but the title text on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] just gives away the solution outright. From left to right:\n*{{w|Malcolm Reynolds|Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds}} - the ship's captain.\n*{{w|Simon Tam}} - a doctor trying to rescue his sister.\n*{{w|Hoban Washburne|Hoban \"Wash\" Washburne}} - the ship's pilot.\n*{{w|Zoe Washburne}} - the ship's second-in-command.\n*{{w|River Tam}} - Simon's sister, who displays superhuman capabilities, but is crippled by alliance research.\n*{{w|Kaylee Frye}} - the ship's happy-go-lucky mechanic.\n*{{w|Jayne Cobb}} - the hired muscle.\n*{{w|Inara Serra}} - a companion, the equivalent of a courtesan, but with a greater deal of respect.\n*{{w|Derrial Book}} - a shepherd, which is similar to a priest, with a very unknown backstory.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Several stick figures stand side by side in a lineup. A forlorn male in a coat, a male with combed hair, a male with spiky hair and arms outstretched enthusiastically, a female with long hair and cornrows, a shorter female with stringy hair falling over her face, an enthusiastic female with arms raised in celebration with shorter hair, a male with short hair and a goatee and hands on hips, a female with curly hair wearing a dress, and a stern-looking man with flyaway hair.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring adorned stick figures (including features like hair and coats) representing distinct characters, a motif that would later become a regular feature throughout the webcomic. This is also the first xkcd comic featuring [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Summer Glau]], and [[Jewel Staite]]. \n\nDespite the title stating that the film was coming out the following day, the comic was released on September 30, 2005, which is also the date of original theatrical release of Serenity. \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 10]]\n[[Category:First day on LiveJournal| 10]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Firefly]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Nathan Fillion]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Summer Glau]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Jewel Staite]]"
