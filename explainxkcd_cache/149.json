The ''{{w|sudo}}'' command (pronounced \"sue do\" or \"pseudo\") lets certain (authorized) UNIX users override these policies by executing the command (everything after the word \"sudo\" on the command line) as the root user. Root (sometimes called the superuser) has complete system powers, exempt from all access controls; it is similar to a Windows administrator, however even the powers of a Windows administrator is limited - the ''system32'' folder, for example, cannot be deleted because it is a critical part of the operating system, while there is no such restriction on UNIX - if a root user feels like deleting (or accidentally deletes) a vital file, they are free to do so. As a result, common advice is to not use sudo unless the command in question absolutely requires it - indeed, most commands do not require such privileges.\n\nOne very common activity for UNIX administrators is to install or configure software using the UNIX ''{{w|Make (software)|make}}'' command, e.g. <code>% '''make install'''</code>.  Often this command requires administrative permissions in order to complete successfully, which in practice means the \"<code>make ''this''</code>\" command will fail unless it is typed as \"<code>sudo make ''this''</code>\" instead. However as mentioned before since most commands work just fine without sudo, along with general discouragement from using it willy-nilly, it is fairly common for people who use or administer UNIX systems to attempt a straight up <code>% make install</code> and have it fail. They then need to repeat the command with \"sudo,\" whereupon the computer responds obediently, and everything works smoothly.\n\n[[Cueball]] is demanding a sandwich from his friend. Not being properly asked, the friend denies the request. Cueball then (ab)uses the sudo command on the friend, who then has no choice but to go and make the sandwich, and now does so without complaint, because Cueball has all the rights. For anyone versed in installing system software with the <code>make</code> command, this exchange is intensely reminiscent of the analogous onscreen experience.\n\n{{w|Simon Says}} is a children's game in which a leader gives various commands that must be followed if and only if ([[1033: Formal Logic|iff]]) the leader prefixes the command with \"Simon says.\" The title text compares the way the computer will run some commands if (and only if) they are preceded with \"sudo\" to the way Simon Says players are supposed to follow orders if (and only if) they are preceded with \"Simon says.\"\n\nAlternatively, the title text might merely be referring to the similarity between Cueball ordering his friend around with \"sudo\" to the Simon Says game leader ordering other players around. Wikipedia suggests  that the \"Simon\" in the name of the game may be the powerful lord Simon de Montfort, or a corruption of Cicero, both of whom were influential politicians of their day.\n\nIn ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'', an additional line is added: <code>Make: *** No rule to make target 'sandwich'. Stop.</code>\nMake uses a file within the program in order to determine how to make it; lack of such a file will give an error. This sentence shows just that happening to 'sandwich': there are no clear instructions that make has found for it, the same way that Cueball has not specified the sandwich beyond its moniker.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting on a couch, talking to a Cueball-like friend.]\n:Cueball: Make me a sandwich.\n:Friend: What?
