The culmination has [[Black Hat]] up to his usual shenanigans in the {{w|United States Senate chamber|US Senate chamber room}}. The hearings have ended, with the chairperson deciding to sentence him to death, instead of confirming his position of Internet Secretary. Black Hat replies that he was \"never interested in taking the position.\" This would be quite weird, as Senate confirmation meetings take a long time. The committee members are obviously surprised, and they question Black Hat, trying to get him to reveal his motives. He then cryptically replies that \"It was taking us a while to move the pumps into the maintenance tunnels.\" The confused committee members then look at each other.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. It may be a continuation of the comic [[493: Actuarial]], in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was nominated as Internet secretary. These are all the comics in [[:Category:Secretary|Secretary series]]:\n* [[494: Secretary: Part 1]]\n* [[495: Secretary: Part 2]]\n* [[496: Secretary: Part 3]]\n* [[497: Secretary: Part 4]]\n* [[498: Secretary: Part 5]]\n\nA red playpen ball bursts out of the panel and rolls towards the committee chairperson, before being followed by a geyser of red, white, and blue balls, which begin to engulf the room and the Senate rotunda. Of course, Black Hat has already escaped by grabbing Tron Paul's lightcycle and using it to smash his way out of the rotunda. Outside the Senate, Cory Doctorow offers Black Hat a lift and asks if he's a fugitive now, and Black Hat replies that they never had his name, which is odd, considering that they know he's stolen a nuclear submarine, along with everything else mentioned in [[496: Secretary: Part 3]]. Back at Congress, they seem to have forgotten about Black Hat's \"gleeful mayhem\" and are jumping off the balcony into the ball pit below. [[:Category:Playpen balls|Playpen balls]] have been the topic of many comics before, notably in [[150: Grownups]].\n\nThe Senate or a Senate committee, in reality, cannot sentence a person to death, as that would be a {{w|Bill of attainder|bill of attainder}}, which Congress is prohibited from passing by Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution: \"No Bill of Attainder ... shall be passed.\" \"An unorthodox move,\" indeed. {{w|Tron (video game)|Tron}} was an arcade game, based on the {{w|Tron (movie)|movie}} of the same name, and both released in 1982. The characters would play on a grid in lightcycles that left behind walls of light. The objective of the game was to force the opponent to run into the wall of light, similar to the {{w|Snake (game)|Snake game}}.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Al Gore}}. Al Gore was the {{w|Vice President of the United States|Vice President}} under President {{w|Bill Clinton}} and ran as the Democratic nominee for President in 2000. Al Gore has had {{w|Al Gore and information technology|quite a history with the Internet}}, including one oft-misquoted (rather, quoted out of context) interview with CNN in which he told {{w|Wolf Blitzer}}, \"During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.\" Many spun this to mean he claimed to have actually invented the Internet himself, although some of its {{w|List of Internet pioneers|pioneers}}, who [https://web.archive.org/web/20191215233809/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/10/02/net_builders_kahn_cerf_recognise/ believe Al Gore to have been crucial for the development of the Internet], clarified what Gore actually meant (that [https://web.archive.org/web/20190904220345/https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a4451/vint-cerf-0508/ \"his initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet\"]) and agreed with this assessment.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The Senate. Black Hat sits before the committee at his hearing to become Internet Secretary. The 4 senators from Part 3 are in front of him. To the left of the 4 senators are 4 rows of seats, with 3, 2, 1, and 1 Cueball(s) sitting at them. To the left of the second row are two more columns of two, with a Megan and Cueball at the first row of the first column and a Cueball with his face down, presumably resting at the first row of the second column. Behind Black Hat are 4 Cueballs sitting in chairs in front of 3 tables, with 2 Cueballs sitting next to each other in between the 2 other Cueballs. There are 2 more Cueballs sitting at different tables behind the 2nd and 3rd tables, and a final Cueball in the 2nd column that is slightly cut-off by the frame.]\n:Chairman: We were convened here to review your nomination for the position of internet secretary.\n\n:Chairman: However, on review of your qualifications, we've decided to sentence you to death.\n\n:Chairman: An unorthodox move, sure.
