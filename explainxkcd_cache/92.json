I feel like I should have a guitar or something.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is about the desire for an intimate connection with another, and the compromises we make to not be alone.\n\n[[Hairy]] finds a certain beauty in the way the world looks without billions of humans crawling around on it. He thinks of this as a secret place that thrills him. He is excited about the remote chance of finding someone like him who appreciates its beauty. But he realizes that it's the very thing that makes this time beautiful to him that makes his imagined chance encounter exceedingly unlikely. Reconciled to the fact that he will not find a kindred spirit outside this morning, he heads back home.\n\nAt the house, he gets ready and drives to a club to meet people. The club is drawn using an inverted color scheme (white people, black background) to emphasize that it is the opposite of the outside world Hairy was enjoying. The club is dark and full of people, who are the lightest things present, while in the outside scene, the natural beauty shines without interruption by human forms. Hairy is seen alone in the middle of the crowd.\n\nThe title text is a reference to a common music video scene (sometimes country music videos) in which people play the guitar on parking garages as the sun rises.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairy is on the street. Behind him is a house with a lawn.]\n:Hairy (thinking): I love the time just before sunrise. It's quiet; no one is ever just walking about.\n:Hairy (thinking): It's like a secret\n:Hairy (thinking): I always hope that I'll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we'll see each other and sit and talk.\n:Hairy (thinking): I guess this is a bad place to meet people.\n:Hairy (thinking): I wish it weren't.\n\n:[Hairy goes into the house, brushes his teeth, shaves his head (?), and leaves the house again.]\n\n:[Hairy is at a club, disco balls in the ceiling and a giant woofer. Many people are dancing around him.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
