Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011, of pancreatic cancer the day before [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] released [[961: Eternal Flame]]. Presumably, the cancer was the cause of Jobs' weight loss, although it was not public information at the time the comic was posted. [[Black Hat]] then mentions that Apple was probably excited to announce its thinnest and lightest CEO in the industry. This comment is a parody of Apple's tendency to release thinner and lighter iterations of its products. Steve Jobs' weight loss would certainly make him a thinner and lighter CEO.\n\nThe title text refers to [[Cory Doctorow]], a blogger, journalist, and science-fiction author. Doctorow is opposed to the technology called {{w|Digital rights management}} (DRM for short). DRM is designed to be abused by large corporations with negative consequences for consumers but is disguised as a copyright protection system. Randall jokingly proposes that Steve Jobs is only sick because Doctorow was torturing him with {{w|Voodoo doll}}s for Apple's use of DRM.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat talking to Cueball sitting at computer.]\n:Cueball: Huh - Steve Jobs isn't doing a keynote this year, citing massive weight loss due to some hormonal problem.\n:Black Hat: Too bad. I bet Apple was excited about unveiling the thinnest and lightest CEO in the industry.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Steve Jobs]]\n[[Category:Sarcasm]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cory Doctorow]]\n[[Category:DRM]]"
