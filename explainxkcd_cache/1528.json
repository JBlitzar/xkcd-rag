I'm pretty much pure alcohol and water, so it doesn't really matter!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Vodka}} is a {{w|distilled beverage}} composed primarily of water and ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of {{w|fermented}} {{w|cereal}} grains or {{w|potatoes}}, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.\n\nWhen people use the phrase \"maybe it's the [type of alcohol] talking\", they usually mean that they are speaking under the {{w|influence of alcohol}} and are saying things they probably wouldn't say when {{w|sober}}. This is similar to the {{w|Latin}} saying \"{{w|in vino veritas}}\" - in wine there is truth. However, in this comic, it appears that the vodka itself is ''literally'' speaking through Ponytail to discuss its origin, potatoes in this case. Other comics in which things have been taken too literally include [[1099: Tuesdays]] and [[1364: Like I'm Five]]. In [[1541: Voice]], Ponytail is {{tvtropes|BodySnatcher|again possessed by a non-human entity}}, or maybe she is just making pranks with Megan in both cases.\n\nIn the title text, the vodka is implying it can be made from many other things beside potatoes. Vodka can be manufactured from potatoes, grain, and most other plants. Most illegal distilled vodka is often made with whatever one has on hand. However, vodkas are often repeatedly distilled to remove the \"foreshots\" (the first few ounces of alcohol that drip from the condenser), the \"heads\" (the higher alcohols which are first to condense during distillation) and the \"tails\" (the lower fusel oils which are last to be distilled). Removal of these leaves a clear solution consisting almost entirely of ethanol and water. This is in contrast to other distilled beverages like {{w|whiskey}}, {{w|brandy}} and {{w|rum}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail and Megan sit together at a table with two small shot glasses on the table. Ponytail is imbibing from a large bottle, while Megan is cradling a relatively large glass.]\n\n:Ponytail: Maybe this is the vodka talking, but:\n:Ponytail: ''Hi! I'm made from potatoes!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
