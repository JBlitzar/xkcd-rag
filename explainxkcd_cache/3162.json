Ponytail goes to check in on the geologists, and finds them discussing a theory which sounds ridiculous to her.  Someone presumably on the faculty of the geology department proposes that a feature called Heart Mountain slid sideways like a hovercraft, in an attempt to explain some aspect of the geology.  Based on hearing this hypothesis, Ponytail concludes that the geology department is not okay.\n\nThe actual {{w|Heart Mountain (Wyoming)#Geology|geology of Heart Mountain}}, in Wyoming, ''is'' very much explained as the comic suggests, though not as neatly as the geologists' purely functional diagram depicts. The main anomaly is that the rock at the top of the mountain is far older than that of its base. There are {{w|Nappe|other processes}} that can result in such {{w|inverted stratigraphy}}, but in this case the evidence does indeed seem to suggest that a (more than) mountain-sized amount of rock was rapidly (in parts at the quoted speed of 90 mph, or more, lasting perhaps just ''half an hour'') forced to slide a significant distance over younger rocks, through the action of various volcanic processes on and above a near-horizontal {{w|Fault (geology)|geological fault}}, after which significant erosion over millions of years has left 'just' the material that forms mountain we now see (and some other traces) in the now anomalous position. (As an added bonus, the first 'European<!-- as distinct from anything that precolumbian natives might ever have already had, non-orally, hence feeling the necessity to have scare-quotes -->' maps of the mountain also had it placed in the wrong position, but this was purely human error and totally unconnected to the prehistoric rearrangement of material.)\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n:[Cueball is on the left, Ponytail is facing him from the right.]\n:Cueball: We haven't checked in on the Geology Department for a while.

Most of the chart is illegible, but near the top it says \"90 MPH\", and below that there's a diagram of geologic strata, with the label \"Bighorn Dolomite\", upon which a sharply rectangular and isolated rock 'block' is depicted. The rock block has speed-lines indicating its rapid movement from left to right.]\n:Cueball: 49 million years ago, Heart Mountain, Wyoming slid sideways 15 miles like a giant stone hovercraft.\n\n:[Ponytail walks back to the Cueball in the first panel's scene.]\n:Ponytail: ...
