Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThe structure of the {{w|Heart Mountain (Wyoming)#Geology|geology of Heart Mountain}}, in Wyoming, is a geological anomaly whose current best scientific explanation is highly unusual. This is humorously summarized as, \"49 million years ago, Heart Mountain, Wyoming slid sideways 15 miles like a giant stone hovercraft\", with a similarly oversimplified functional diagram. Those not following the evidence that leads to this unusual conclusion may decide those involved do not have a normal state of mind ('are not doing ok'), and potentially sliding into pseudoscience like that of {{w|Pyramidology}}. The geologists acknowledge this, but ask, \"Hey, you come up with a better explanation!\" - as all more 'reasonable' explanations have been eliminated, and only the seemingly absurd remain.\n\nThe main anomaly is that the rock at the top of the mountain is far older than that of its base. There are {{w|Nappe|other processes}} that can result in such {{w|inverted stratigraphy}}, but in this case the evidence does indeed seem to suggest that sometime 48-50 million years ago (most likely 48.9 Mya) a massive landslide was rapidly (in parts at the quoted speed of 90 mph (145&nbsp;km/h), or more, lasting perhaps just ''half an hour'') forced to slide a significant distance over younger rocks, through the contribution of one or other volcanic processes on and above a near-horizontal {{w|Fault (geology)|geological fault}}. \n\nWhile the comic implies the mountain by itself levitating on volcanic gasses as it moved across the ground, Heart Mountain is in reality a remnant closer to the leading edge of a massive landslide (the Heart Mountain Detachment) that covered several thousand square kilometers of the Absaroka basin. It would have accompanied and been partially or fully buried by other, looser debris before being uncovered by erosion. However, the remainder of the landslide debris over younger rocks either did not remain upright during the landslide or has been eroded away. Many of the other remaining upright formations did not slide nearly so far, still remaining above older rock formations. Therefore, Heart Mountain remains as the main rock formation with the anomalous inverted stratigraphy caused by the landslide.\n\n<!-- Maybe better reinserted, after the Transcript, as ==Trivia==? -->As an added bonus, the first 'European<!-- as distinct from anything that precolumbian natives might ever have already had, non-orally, hence feeling the necessity to have scare-quotes -->' maps of the mountain also {{w|Heart Mountain (Wyoming)#Hart Mountain|may have placed it}} in the wrong position, but this was purely human error and totally unconnected to the prehistoric rearrangement of material.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n:[Cueball is on the left, Ponytail is facing him from the right.]\n:Cueball: We haven't checked in on the Geology Department for a while.
