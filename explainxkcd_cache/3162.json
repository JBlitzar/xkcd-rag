Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThe structure of the {{w|Heart Mountain (Wyoming)#Geology|geology of Heart Mountain}}, in Wyoming, is a geological anomaly whose current best scientific explanation is highly unusual.\n\nThe main anomaly is that the rock at the top of the mountain is far older than that of its base. There are {{w|Nappe|other processes}} that can result in such {{w|inverted stratigraphy}}, but in this case the evidence does indeed seem to suggest that a (more than) mountain-sized amount of rock was rapidly (in parts at the quoted speed of 90 mph (145&nbsp;km/h), or more, lasting perhaps just ''half an hour'') forced to slide a significant distance over younger rocks, through the action of one or other volcanic processes on and above a near-horizontal {{w|Fault (geology)|geological fault}}, after which significant erosion over millions of years has removed much (but not all) of the material that would give the original context. \n\nThis is humorously summarized as \"49 million years ago, Heart Mountain, Wyoming slid sideways 15 miles like a giant stone hovercraft\" with a similarly oversimplified functional diagram. Those not following the evidence that leads to this unusual conclusion may decide those involved do not have a normal state of mind ('are doing ok'), and potentially sliding into pseudoscience like that of {{w|Pyramidology}}. The geologists acknowledge this, but ask, \"Hey, you come up with a better explanation!\" - as all more 'reasonable' explanations have been eliminated, and only the seemingly absurd remain.\n\n<!-- Maybe better reinserted, after the Transcript, as ==Trivia==? -->As an added bonus, the first 'European<!-- as distinct from anything that precolumbian natives might ever have already had, non-orally, hence feeling the necessity to have scare-quotes -->' maps of the mountain also {{w|Heart Mountain (Wyoming)#Hart Mountain|may have placed it}} in the wrong position, but this was purely human error and totally unconnected to the prehistoric rearrangement of material.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n:[Cueball is on the left, Ponytail is facing him from the right.]\n:Cueball: We haven't checked in on the Geology Department for a while.

Most of the chart is illegible, but near the top it says \"90 MPH\", and below that there's a diagram of geologic strata, with the label \"Bighorn Dolomite\", upon which a sharply rectangular and isolated rock 'block' is depicted. The rock block has speed-lines indicating its rapid movement from left to right.]\n:Cueball: 49 million years ago, Heart Mountain, Wyoming slid sideways 15 miles like a giant stone hovercraft.\n\n:[Ponytail walks back to the Cueball from the first panel's scene.]\n:Ponytail: ...
