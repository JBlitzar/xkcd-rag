Here we see lead guitarist {{w|Nigel Tufnel}} (a character portrayed in the movie by {{w|Christopher Guest}}) explaining to [[Cueball]] how the volume dial on his amp goes all the way {{w|up to eleven}}. This is impressive to Nigel since guitar amplifiers generally only have ten as the maximum setting. This leads him to believe his amp is {{tvtropes|UpToEleven|\"one\" louder than other amplifiers}}.\n\nIn reality, the loudness of an amplifier is largely dependent on how much power is supplied to its electronics.  Markings on the volume dial are merely an aspect of appearance and has no influence on the maximum achievable loudness.  The highest mark could just as easily be labelled 'Maximum', which would then accurately describe the meaning of that setting.  Thus, the phrase \"goes to eleven\" is often used sarcastically to mock people or statements that rely on arbitrary numbers without comparable units or context.\n\nThe comic then extends the joke by presenting three types of reactions from different people:\n* The normal guy understands that using eleven is silly, and wants to know what is wrong with the usual way of numbering from one to ten -- the question that is raised in the original film, to which Nigel simply responds, \"''These'' go to eleven.\"\n* The engineer is desperate to explain to Nigel the fallacy in his thinking, but his {{w|jargon}} just sends Nigel to sleep.  He remains unenlightened.\n* The smart engineer sees an opportunity: it doesn't cost any more to number the volume dial differently, but Nigel places a real value on higher numbers.  The smart engineer offers to sell him an amp that goes to twelve, but at a hefty premium.\n\nThe title text further plays on the fact that the amp's levels are on an arbitrary scale. Many products are sold at a certain price per unit weight, volume, etc. (e.g., $2.99/lb for grapes). Nigel calculates that the $2000 cost for going up to 12 would equal to $2000 / 12, or less than $200 per unit of something, but he is unable to articulate what that \"something\" is, confirming the third panel observation of the normal engineer. Also, he already has an amplifier that goes up to eleven, so the one additional unit would cost him $2,000 unless he sells the old amplifier. However, he decides that it's a good deal anyway, and it looks like the smart engineer has made a sale.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Nigel Tufnel of Spın̈al Tap is showing off his amplifier to Cueball.]\n:Nigel: These amps go to 11.\n:Cueball: Is that louder?\n:Nigel: It's one louder.\n\n:Normal Person:\n:Cueball: Why not make 10 louder and make 10 the highest?\n\n:Engineer:\n:Cueball: But 11 doesn't have any units. It's an arbitrary scale mapping outputs—\n:Nigel: Zzzz\n\n:Smart Engineer:\n:Cueball: For $2,000 I'll build you one that goes to 12.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Engineering]]"
