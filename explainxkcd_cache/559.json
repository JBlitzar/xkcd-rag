As done in the comic, following a non-pun with \"no pun intended\", although factually accurate, breaks this implication and confuses listeners who will be trying to work out which part of the sentence could have been interpreted as a pun. This could be a form of [[Nerd Sniping]], similarly to [[2032: Word Puzzles]]\n\nIn this comic, which is part of the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby]] series, [[Cueball]] uses this tactic to confuse [[Beret Guy]], who spends the next three hours trying to understand what pun there could have been in Cueball's sentence: ''I think he's internalized his girlfriend's attitudes''.<br>The guy Cueball talks about seems to have taken over ({{w|Internalization|internalized}}) all his girlfriend's attitudes, values, standards and opinions, putting these instead of those he has from his own identity or sense of self. This is probably sad, but there is no pun in the sentence.\n\nBeret Guy, however, has been fooled by the addition of ''no pun intended'' and tries to overanalyze the sentence - did Cueball mean ''Lied'' when saying ''Interna'''li'''z'''ed''''' or was it ''Analyzed'' or even ''Attitudes'' he meant; could that be the pun? Since there was no pun, he will never find a solution. This was Cueball's plan all along. \n\nIt seems like Beret Guy, after three hours, finally gives up when he says ''Dammit''. This then leads to the title text joke.\n\nUnfortunately for the hobbyist, blank puns default to sexual innuendos, the most notorious example being [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/if-you-know-what-i-mean \"If You Know What I Mean.\"]\n\nThe title text elicits a similar confused reaction, as the most literate people will be more likely to want to spell out \"[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/damn_it damn it]\" rather than using the also correct abbreviated form with morphed spelling, [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dammit dammit], which is referred to as ''with two m's'' because many people ([http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/79282/dammit-vs-damnit mainly in the US] it seems) contract damn it to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/damnit damnit], which is the \"wrong way\".\n\nThis way of confusing people and messing with their brains is normally an action done by [[Black Hat]], xkcd's resident classhole. The reason Cueball is shown is probably because Randall uses Cueball to represent himself.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:'''My Hobby:'''\n:Appending \"no pun intended\" \n:to lines with no pun in them.\n\n:[Cueball is talking to Beret Guy.]\n:Cueball: I think he's internalized his girlfriend's attitudes - no pun intended - and so...\n\n:[The next panel is inlaid partly over the first panel.
