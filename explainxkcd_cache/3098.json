The retelling is a {{w|feghoot}}, set up to deliver the pun in the title text as well as a deconstruction of the story, replacing the epic elements with far more ordinary ones while keeping the tone of the tale the same.\n\nThe premise is that the Trojan Horse story's origin is mundane. The gift to the Trojans by the (supposedly) departing Greek army, we are told, was a normal-sized, living mare, which promptly and unexpectedly dropped (i.e. gave birth to) a foal. According to the title text, this is the story of the \"Foal of Troy\", which \"history imperfectly recorded\". In the \"imperfect record\" (i.e. the {{w|Epic Cycle}} and later works based on it which tell the story of the entire Trojan War), the normal-sized live horse became a colossal wooden statue that \"dropped\" a commando unit of some 40 Greek soldiers, who opened the gates of Troy to the main Greek force (who had sailed back under the cover of darkness), resulting in the \"''Fall'' of Troy\". The pun is implicit, as \"Fall of Troy\" does not appear in the comic. \"Fall\" and \"foal\" share the initial consonant and stem vowel in Ancient Greek (''πτῶσις'' vs. ''πῶλος''), whilst spelled even more similarly in English as well as being nearly {{w|homophone}}s.\n\nIt is not made clear whether the gifter of the horse knew of/suspected the pregnancy or whether they would have even chosen to hand it over under different circumstances. However, it is consistent with the story, and with the \"{{w|Beware of Greeks bearing gifts}}\" trope that originated with it, that the Greeks intentionally gifted a pregnant mare to annoy the Trojans. Surprise foals, where a mare is purchased with a hitherto unknown pregnancy, actually occur. The pregnancy is typically excused as weight gain, up until the point where a foal is discovered with its mother in the morning. Horses with rounder builds, like some pony breeds, are known for maintaining undetected pregnancies. The reason a surprise foal might be salient for the comic, beyond the \"Foal of Troy\" pun, is the non-trivial costs of horse ownership, which can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars per month. Food costs are part of (but not all of) this, as the comic touches on.\n\nThe humor in the joke comes from an anachronistic assumption — that a pregnant mare would be seen as a costly burden rather than a generous gift. In reality, during the time period referenced, horses (particularly one as large as the mare depicted in the comic) were highly valued for labor, transport, and even as a food source if necessary. Far from being an unwelcome expense, such a gift would have been considered a significant and practical boon. The joke plays on the incongruity of projecting modern attitudes backward, pretending that horses were once the kind of liability they are now. Furthermore, based on how Cueball calls the offspring an \"inner horse\" instead of a foal (the term for a child horse), the fact that he interprets the foal's interest in oats (even though foals suckle their mother's milk for the first 8-10 months before weaning to solid food) as an attack upon Troy's food supply even though all horses need to eat but are nonetheless considered useful by humans, and his overall surprise that the mare gave birth, it seems that he does not know very much about horses. Calling a foal an \"inner horse\" would be analogous to calling a baby an \"inner human\", thus reflecting a lack of knowledge of placental mammalian reproduction similar to [[441: Babies]].\n\nThough unlikely to be the source of inspiration for the comic, the Iliad does mention a (perceived) shortage of Troy's fodder, as Pandarus (a Lycian archer coming to the aid of Troy) indicated to Aeneas (a prince of Troy): “And twice ten coursers wait their lord’s command. / ... / And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown) / Might fail of forage in the straiten’d town;” (Il. V. 194-203). However, the conversation happened while Troy was actively attacked, rather than after the Greeks retreated when this comic takes place.\n\nArchaeological evidence of a military conquest of {{w|Troy}} during the Bronze Age, or even of a major war centered on the city, is lacking. Far better evidence exists for the destruction of several iterations of the city by earthquakes. Possibly, the Trojan War legend arose as visitors attempted to explain the ruins of an earthquake-ravaged, deserted city. The \"Foal of Troy\" story, therefore, need not include a Greek conquest of Troy, or even a major military conflict with the Greeks.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A horse is facing Cueball and Ponytail, who are standing in front of an entrance below a tower.]\n:[In an inset panel, Cueball is talking to Megan and Hairy.]\n:Cueball: When the Greeks departed, they left behind a horse as a gift.\n\n:[Hairbun is standing behind a horse, with Cueball standing in front.]\n:We took it as a gesture of peace, but it carried a secret payload.\n\n:[A smaller horse is standing behind the horse from previous panel, which is looking behind at it.]\n:One night, from within the horse, '''''another, smaller horse emerged!'''''\n\n:[Close-up on Cueball.]\n:Cueball: Our guards have been unable to determine the inner horse's objective, but it has begun to show an interest in our oats.\n:Off-panel voice 1: An attack on Troy's food supply!\n:Off-panel voice 2: How ''dare'' they!?\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Mythology]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
