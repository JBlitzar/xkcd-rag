At dawn, look to the east.' 'And look to the west to see our shadows!'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is a parody of {{w|J.R.R. Tolkien}}'s ''{{w|The Lord of the Rings}}''. The name of the horse, Shadowfacts, is a pun on ''{{w|Shadowfax (Middle-earth)|Shadowfax}}'', the horse {{w|Gandalf}} rides in the books. As the name \"Shadowfacts\" suggests, this horse interjects into conversations various facts about shadows, much to Gandalf's annoyance. There is a possible deeper level to the pun, referring to the [http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/241756-cat-facts-text-trolling cat facts meme].\n\nThe three parts of a shadow are the {{w|umbra}}, {{w|penumbra}} and {{w|antumbra}}.\n\nIn the title text, Gandalf continues to speak, and is interrupted again by the horse with another fact about shadows. \"Look to my coming on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east.\" is what Gandalf said before the battle of Helm's Deep when he went to get reinforcements. The horse notes that if the sun is in the east, the shadows will be to the west of the objects that cast them, which isn't particularly useful in this scenario.\n\nA similar talking horse appears in [[936: Password Strength]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Gandalf sits on a horse, addressing three hobbits.]\n:Gandalf: This is Shadowfacts, lord of all horses, and heâ€“\n:Shadowfacts: The outer part of a shadow is called the penumbra!\n:Gandalf: ''Shut up.''\n\n==Trivia==\n*Both quotes spoken from Gandalf are close to the actual ones in the movies, but not directly.\n*The quote from the comic was a reply to Legolas instead of the hobbits. The quote is as follows: \"Shadowfax. He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers\"\n*The title text's original quote is: \"Look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:LOTR]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
