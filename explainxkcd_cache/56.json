The previous comic, [[55: Useless]], was the last comic originally posted to [[LiveJournal]]. The [[:Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com|last eleven comics]] were posted both on LiveJournal and on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] after the new site was launched.\n\n==Explanation==\nThe \"real face\" is that of {{w|Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith}}, best known as the singer of the musical group {{w|The Cure}}, hence the title. When Robert would sing the above lines of {{w|Coldplay}}'s song \"{{w|Clocks (song)|Clocks}}\", fans of his music would know the answer: he's part of The Cure.\n\nIn the title text, Randall notes that he has not tried to draw a real face in years, as he mainly draws [[stick figure]]s. In that way this comic also sticks out ([[No Pun Intended|no pun intended]]). It is possible that he is preemptively apologizing for a lack of quality in the comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A charcoal drawing of Robert Smith's head and face.]\n:[Caption below:]\n:Robert Smith should do a cover of Coldplay's ''Clocks'', so when he sings \"Am I part of the cure or am I part of the disease?\" we can say, \"Ooh, we know this one!\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
