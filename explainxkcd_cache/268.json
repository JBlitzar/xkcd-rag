This looks like a job for Science!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn the final part of [[:Category:Choices|Choices]], [[Megan]] is back to real life, and has forgotten about her trip, as afterlife-Megan said. However, she has an {{w|Epiphany_(feeling)|epiphany}}, and in the spirit of what she told her, she talks to the stranger on the street. The stranger is likely Cueball who studied the physics problem she encountered from [[265|part 2]], as they both use a similar backpack. The urge to talk to strangers in awkward situations has been touched on in [[235: Kite]] and can also be used when you are already flying a kite (see [[1614: Kites]].)\n\nNotably, at the point in the comic where Megan has her epiphany, the panel border is absent. This brief disappearance of the boundary layer could symbolize Megan partially remembering the conversation she had with herself in the space 'outside the theater', her mind briefly making that outside connection before returning to her life with her other self's hints in mind.\n\nThe title text suggests a weird sociological investigation. The capital \"S\" in \"Science\" suggests a {{w|personification}}.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week.
