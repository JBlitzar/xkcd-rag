The idea is that by dropping a series of interesting links, one could stop someone else's movement as they take the time to go through them all, provided that they are also easily distracted. This is analogous to the {{w|caltrops}} mentioned in the title; caltrops are small, spiked implements that are scattered on a road to slow down someone pursuing you. Hence the title of ''Wikipedia Caltrops''.\n\nWikipedia is also a website that is notorious for having many links to other pages, which may result in a \"wiki walk\", a dilemma for [[Randall]] that has been discussed previously in [[214: The Problem with Wikipedia]] (and separately with TV Tropes in [[609: Tab Explosion]]).\n\nThis strategy is similar to a weaponized version of [[356: Nerd Sniping]], using the high levels of focus that tend to come along with nerdy interests against someone. Munroe apparently reasons that, because these links would stop him in his tracks, they might do the same for a given target. \n\nThe Wikipedia links include:\n* {{w|1808 mystery eruption}}: A conjectured volcanic eruption\n* {{w|1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game}}: The most uneven college football game in history\n* {{w|1994 Caribbean Cup#Anomaly}}: A soccer game where group stage qualification rules had unintended consequences\n* {{w|American death triangle}}: An unsafe type of rock climbing anchor\n* {{w|AVE Mizar}}: A 1970s flying car\n* {{w|Bald-hairy}}: A Russian political theory about state leaders' hairstyles\n* {{w|Boeing YAL-1}}: A laser weapon mounted on a military aircraft\n* {{w|Bubbly Creek}}: A stretch of river in Chicago featured in ''The Jungle''\n* {{w|Burned house horizon}}: An area where Neolithic people burned their settlements\n* {{w|Defence Scheme No. 1}}: A 1920s plan for Canada to attack the USA\n* {{w|Elsagate}}: A YouTube controversy involving inappropriate videos being categorised as child-friendly\n* {{w|Fastest animals#Invertebrates}}: Very fast insects, and some squid\n* {{w|Flying ice cube}}: An effect in molecular dynamics simulations\n* {{w|Future of Earth#Introversion}}: A model of future continental drift in which the Atlantic closes up\n* {{w|Hairy Hands}}: A ghost story in Dartmoor, England\n* {{w|January 0}}: December 31st in some software programs\n* {{w|List of fictional colors}}: Impossible colours in fiction\n* {{w|List of unexplained sounds}}: Mostly detected by NOAA, includes the Bloop\n* {{w|Talk:List of U.S. states and territories by elevation/Archive 1#Delaware - Ebright Azimuth}}: A user argues the highest point in Delaware isn't Ebright Azimuth, but a trailer park\n* {{w|Mosquito laser}}: A proposed device for killing mosquitoes\n* {{w|Pheasant Island}}: An island shared equally between France and Spain\n* {{w|Time in Australia#Anomalies}}: Places in Australia which do not use the expected time zone\n* {{w|Timeline of the far future}}: Scientific speculation\n* {{w|Walkalong glider}}: A type of unpowered model aircraft\n\nMentioned in the title text, a \"{{w|Czech hedgehog}}\" is an anti-tank obstacle made of metal, essentially a large caltrop. It would be an effective roadblock, however a sign describing it would not impede most traffic, <sup>&#91;[[285: Wikipedian Protester|''citation needed'']]&#93;</sup> only for those distracted as easily as Randall.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball drives a car, followed by another car driven by Hairy. Cueball is leaning on the open window looking back as 24 large paper slips with Wikipedia links are flying out of the open trunk of the car. They extend to the front of Hairy's car, obscuring that all the way up to Hairy's position in the car. None of the links can be read in full, and only on a few can parts of the actual link be seen. Many has only part of the pages title visible, some parts are obstructed partly by other slips in front of them or they have not entirely left the trunk. In once case the link is so long that it has been split on two lines on a thicker slip. There is a large part of the link that cannot be seen after the first line, but the end of the second line can be seen as well. Here the (fairly) readable parts are given, roughly in normal reading order.]\n:a.org/wiki/Elsagate\n:wiki/Bubbly_Creek\n:wiki/Pheasant_Island\n:a.org/wiki/American_death_triangle\n:List_of_fictional_colors\n:/wiki/Future_of_Earth#Introversion\n:pedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals#Invertebrates\n:ki/Defence_Scheme_No._1\n:i/Boeing_YAL-1\n:ki/Bald-hairy\n:/Walkalong_glider\n:Burned_house_horizon\n:/wiki/AVE Mizar\n:Flying_ice_cube\n:Time in Australia#Anomalies:\n:Unexplained_sounds\n:Talk:List_of_U.S._states_and_\n:::::Ebright_Azimuth\n:Mosquito_laser\n:January_0\n:/1808_mystery_eruption\n:/Hairy_Hands\n:Cumberland_vs._Georgia_Tech_football_game\n:Timeline_of_the_far_future\n:/wiki/1994_Caribbean_Cup#Anomaly\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I have a collection of Wikipedia links to throw behind my car if I'm ever being chased by someone as easily distracted as me.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]"
