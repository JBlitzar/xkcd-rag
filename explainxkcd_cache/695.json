The rover lasted 5Â¼ active years on the Martian surface, far exceeding its expected mission duration of 90 Martian days. A sentient  robot might assume that after its initially planned 90 {{w|Timekeeping on Mars|Martian day}} mission was over, it would get to return home.  This assumes, of course, that the rover never understood that the mission was a one-way trip, and that the expectation was that it would simply fail after ninety days. When no one comes to return it home, ''Spirit'', possibly in a pun on its name, keeps its hopes alive while continuously analyzing rock after rock for ''years.'' \n\nIt would be cruelty of the absolute worst kind to abandon a human on an uninhabited planet with no intention of ''ever'' bringing them home,{{Citation needed}} so it's horrifying when we see the rover in this way. It's a relief to us that the Spirit rover is just a programmed machine.\n\n{{w|Opportunity rover|Opportunity}}, the rover's twin, lasted longer than Spirit and was shut down in February 2019 ([[2111: Opportunity Rover]]). More than five years after this comic, when Opportunity had passed a Marathon distance, [[Randall]] celebrated this rover with the comic [[1504: Opportunity]].\n\nThe title text has an apparent miscount: January 26, 2010, is more like sol (Martian day) 2156 by JPL's [http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2010.html#sol2151 mission status site,] not 2274.\n\nThe final contact with ''Spirit'' was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010).\n\n;Alternative versions\nThe strip had a strong emotional impact on the fans of the rover, who created a number of alternative versions and endings for it.\n\nIn a [http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/02/08/android-bug-reports-songs-rovers/ blog post] Randall mentioned this upbeat [https://imgs.xkcd.com/blag/spirit_rewrite_unknown_author.png rewrite] of the comic.

Others imagine a [http://xkcdsw.com/3968 future] when the rover is not alone any more.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The ''Spirit'' rover is on the surface of Mars.]\n:Day 1 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): 89 days to go!\n\n:Day 88 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): Two days until I go home!\n\n:Day 91 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): ?\n\n:Day 103 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): Maybe I didn't do a good enough job.\n\n:Day 127 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): Maybe if I do a good enough job, they'll let me come home.\n\n:Day 857 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): I thought I analyzed that rock really well.\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): It's okay, I'll do the next one better.\n\n:Day 1328 of 90\n:''Spirit'' (thinking): Sandstorm.
