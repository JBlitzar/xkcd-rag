[more]\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThis comic proposes Spacetime Soccer, a sport consisting of a \"regular\" soccer field with a gravitational well in the center of it. This comic was likely published in relation to the {{w|2022 FIFA World Cup}} which, due to numerous controversies surrounding policies and conditions in the host country, {{w|Qatar}}, was prevalent in the 2022 news cycle for weeks.\n\nJudging by the size of the blackest part of the indentation, presuming that indicates the event horizon of a {{w|black hole}}, the radius of its {{w|event horizon}} would be approximately 9.6 meters and the singularity's mass would be around 6.5×10<sup>27</sup> kilograms, or more than 1082 times the mass of the Earth [https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/schwarzschild-radius].\n\nNot only would it be impossible for human players to travel through more than three spatial dimensions at will, it would also be very difficult to keep track of score and rules such as offsides.\n\n{{w|Offside (association football)|Offside}} is a rule in soccer that applies to players who are in certain positions relative to the boundaries of the {{w|Football pitch|pitch}}, the ball and the second-last opponent on the opposing team. Players in such positions are eligible for being judged guilty of an offside offence if they become involved in the ongoing play before rectifying their status. It is of special importance to know the different players' positions at the exact moment the ball gets passed, rather than when the passed ball may be received or the offside player is otherwise considered active. However, in relativistic spacetime, there is no universal definition of an exact moment beyond a single point, as time may run at different speeds for multiple observers in varying situations (where they are moving relative to each other, are influenced by differing local gravity or – as seems very likely in this example – both). An additional joke is that even in regular soccer, the offside rule is notoriously difficult to fully understand (or explain to someone).\n\nThe title text is written in the style of the beginning to a Wikipedia article on the topic. It alludes to the fact that most countries in the world refer to the sport with that particular obscure offside rule as football (or some translation thereof, like fútbol or Fußball) while the USA, Canada, Ireland, Japan and Australia all tend to call it soccer, which comes from the British shortening of \"association football\", because they already used the name \"football\" for {{w|gridiron football}}, {{w|Gaelic football}} or {{w|Australian football}} (which share a common ancestry, along with \"{{w|rugby football}}\", hence the name).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[On a gray \"rubber sheet\" visualization of a gravity well is drawn some of the lines of a standard Association Football (Soccer) pitch. Visible features of the standard pitch are the outside borders, the goals and the small and large boxes around each goal. The corner quarter circles, the penalty spots (with associated D) and the center line are all absent. The central circle is lost or concealed by the curvature of the gravity well. There are a number of other lines encircling and radial to the gravity well, they are visually identical to the familiar pitch markings so it is unclear whether these are intended to be drawn on the pitch or merely indications of the shape of the surface, or both, for the purpose of helping players to avoid the well. The lengthwise field boundary line on the visible far side partly follows/is partly followed by a suitable radial line before splitting off and conspicuously curving within the respective lip of the well to rejoin the radial line emerging at the complimentary angle in the opposing half of the field. A total of twenty white stick figures can be seen on the pitch. A Cueball and Knit Cap are standing near the goal mouths, while the rest are distributed fairly evenly around the field, ten on each side of the middle. Five are within the inner circle around the well, and are distorted or tilted by the increased slope of the surface. A ball with motion lines is landing by the feet of Megan who is running up one wing near, but left, of the central part of the field. This player is close to the deeper part of the well. In total, there are two Cueballs, two Hairys, four Ponytails, seven Megans, the Knit Cap and four other people that are not obvious characters. The color of the field becomes darker the deeper it goes into the well, from the normal gray color that extends from the two ends of the pitch to about halfway to the center of the field, in six sections until it is almost black at the deepest part of the well that is visible over the rim of the near part of the field.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:] \n:Spacetime Soccer got a lot of criticism for how many players fell into the gravity well, but what ultimately doomed it was the advanced mathematics required to figure out the offsides rule.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Soccer]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
