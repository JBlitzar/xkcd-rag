I'm gonna go cry into a pint of Ben&Jerry's Brownie Batter(tm) ice cream [link], then take out my frustration on a variety of great flash games from PopCap Games(r) [link]\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Rob]] is having online chats with what appears at first glance to be a woman. However, he grows suspicious at the apparent consumerism dedication of the \"woman\" - and perhaps of the perfection of the online connection, touching on the stereotypical nerd fear that any relationship going well must contain some secret flaw - and so requests that they both \"get tested\". The woman on the other end of the computer does not pass a {{w|CAPTCHA}} test and is unable to prove she is a human.\n\nIn using the phrase \"get tested\", the comic is making a joke that refers both to the CAPTCHA test above and the {{w|Sexually transmitted disease|STD or VD}} test that couples will take to make sure they are physically free of communicable diseases.\n\nA {{w|spambot}} is an automated program (comparable in many ways to a robot) that sends out emails or links (such as in the title text) to simulate a human's writing but contains advertising. The test that Rob and \"Lisa\" take is called \"VK\", a reference to the Voight-Kampff empathy tests from the novel ''{{w|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep}}'' and the film ''{{w|Blade Runner}}''. The test in these works is intended to distinguish real humans from very realistic humanoid robots called \"replicants\". Both CAPTCHAs and the Voight-Kampff test are related to the {{w|Turing test}}, a way to measure the degree to which a computer can successfully imitate a human.\n\nThe name \"Lisa\" can have different interpretations:\n* {{w|ELIZA}} was one of the first chatbots, written in 1966. According to its (her?) creator, people became \"quickly and deeply emotionally involved with the computer program\" during the chat.\n* The 1985 movie ''{{w|Weird Science (film)|Weird Science}}'' featured a computer girlfriend named \"Lisa\".\n* The precursor to the Apple Macintosh was the {{w|Apple Lisa}}.\n\nThe title text is the spambot's last sad goodbye â€” it includes lots of product advertisements and links, such as an online advertiser may insert into a search results page.\n\n[[329: Turing Test]] is another comic dealing with Turing tests/CAPTCHAs.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Rob is sitting at a computer, typing.]\n:Rob: I've loved our online chats these past few months, Lisa.\n:Computer: Me too. I really like you, Rob.\n\n:[Rob continues to type.]\n:Rob: It's just... now and then you mention products you like, and... I worry.\n:Computer: What? Honey...\n\n:[Rob types.]\n:Rob: Before this goes any further, I think we should go get tested. You know, together.\n:Computer: You don't trust me?\n:Rob: I just want to be sure.\n\n:[A web browser is open.]\n:VK Couples Testing\n:Test ID: 21871138\n:Waiting...Partner connected.\n:(A pair of CAPTCHA images)\n:[You] Library\n:[Partner] Kittens\n:Rob: Okay, mine says \"library\".
