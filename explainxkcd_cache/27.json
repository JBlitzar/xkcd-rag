The previous one was [[26: Fourier]], and the next one was [[30: Donner]].\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall Munroe|Randall]] parodies several real-world breakfast cereals (which typically consist solely of grains and sweet flavorings) by creating versions that contain meat (animal products). The cereals that appear to be parodied (clockwise from top-left) include Froot Loops, Rice Krispies, Honey Bunches of Oats, Apple Jacks, Frosted Flakes, and Cheerios. There does not appear to be a deeper meaning to this comic than that. The Scrapple Jacks parody (the only slightly obscure reference) appears to be made with {{w|scrapple}}, which, according to Wikipedia, is a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and wheat flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices. Real Apple Jacks ran an ad campaign in the 1980s and 1990s in which an adult or authority figure tasted the cereal and declared \"these don't taste like apples!\", thus missing the point of why kids liked the cereal. The slogan is parodied on the Scrapple Jacks box. Randall referenced this same slogan again in \"[[38: Apple Jacks]]\".\n\nThe title text apparently reflects Randall's opinion of his own creation.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A collection of fictional meat-based cereals in bright colors with nice pictures on them.]\n:Pork Loops\n:Mice Krispies\n:Hammios\n:Frosted Bacon Flakes\n:Scrapple Jacks\n::Hey, these don't taste like Scrapple!\n:Honey Bunches of Goats\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 28]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
