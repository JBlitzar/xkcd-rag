I have lost every other piece of DRM-locked music that I ever paid for.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|DRM}}, an acronym standing for Digital Rights Management, is a recent anti-piracy mechanism that is used to prevent unapproved or unintended use of software programs. Examples would be a requirement to play a video game while online (where the servers can validate that the game has not been hacked) or allowing only a limited amount of installations to ensure that different users are buying the program for themselves instead of sharing it. The problem is that there are ways that DRM can be restrictive even upon legal situations. Someone may simply want to play the game in an area where there is no Internet connection, or they may have exceeded the amount of allowed installs due to installation problems or hardware malfunctions requiring the purchase of new hardware. In the audio situation described in the comic, one could not, say, transfer an audiobook or song from an iPod to a Blackberry phone, because Apple does not allow files on its operating system to be used on ones from other companies. For this reason, DRM has also been referred to derisively as [http://www.defectivebydesign.org/ \"Digital Restrictions Management\"].\n\n[[Black Hat]] uses a [[:Category:Flowcharts|flow chart]] to propose two paths:\n*If you pirate the audio, the DRM would necessarily be disabled or removed in order to be available in that fashion. This is in violation of copyright law and is also considered theft in some countries such as the United States, since it avoids payment to the publishers, performers, composers, etc. who created the audio.\n\n*If you buy the DRM-locked audio, you have legally obtained it for use on your device. However, as Black Hat puts it, \"things change\": the device you have the audio stored on could be lost, stolen, or broken. The device will inevitably get old enough that the company that made it will stop supporting updates for it, and newer software may no longer be compatible with it. In the worst case scenario, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/apple-samsung-fined-for-slowing-down-phones the device may be sabotaged by the company]. If the DRM prevents the audio from being recovered or transferred from the device or allows [http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-kindle-1984 the service providing you with the audio to delete it], you would have to pay for it a second time to re-obtain it legally, which no one wants to do. The only other solution is breaking the DRM to try to recover your collection by force, and Black Hat argues that this is inevitable.\n\nSince both situations have you end up being a criminal, Black Hat proposes taking the pirate path, which leaves you with a collection of dependable audio for free. In the title-text, [[Randall]] gives an anecdote of how ridiculous it was to obtain an audiobook legally, and how all of his other legally-obtained music has been lost, as the flow chart predicts.\n\nIn light of this, he proposes another option: demanding DRM-free files.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are other methods of listening to music legally that avoid the problems presented in the comic:\n*You can purchase a hardcopy of the audio (e.g. a CD). These are then easily ripped to your hard drive and then copied to other devices, plus a physical item can be useful for older sound systems that do not support digital media. However, there are some downsides: higher cost, delayed delivery, necessity of physical storage space, wearing down of the physical device, and in many cases the non-availability of the desired audio in the first place.\n*You can decide instead to think of audio as an experience rather than a thing that you own (similar to going to a movie theater). This type of thinking has given rise to music subscription sites, such as {{w|Spotify}}, where instead of owning the music, the listener is paying for continued access to a very large range of music. However this makes the user dependent on the availability of content on the chosen platform, which [https://help.netflix.com/en/node/60541 may be subject to changes], hence Randall specifying \"a collection '''you can count on'''\".\n\nThe title is a reference to the [http://web.archive.org/web/20080913131048/http://www.piracyisacrime.com/ \"Piracy is a Crime\"] ad campaign, as well as a 1970 pro-anarchy book called ''{{w|Steal This Book}}''. There is also some underlying humor: since xkcd [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/ is under a Creative Commons license], you cannot \"steal\" the comic, since Randall specifically allowed the comic to be shared. It could also be a reference to ''{{w|Don't Download This Song}}'', a \"Weird Al\" Yankovic song that amusingly deals with audio piracy.\n\nA note on the site says that [http://www.amazon.com Amazon] sells DRM-free music files. Since this comic was written, iTunes has also stopped using DRM on music, though it still protects apps, e-books, and videos.\n\nThis comic is not applicable to some countries, such as Canada, where copyright infringement is purely a civil matter and is not a criminal offense.\n\nIn ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'', [[Beret Guy]] says:\n{{quote|Hey, turns out we won this one! Good job, all! Party at my place!}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:Black Hat: Thinking of buying from audible.com or iTunes?\n:Black Hat: Remember, if you pirate something, it's yours for life.
