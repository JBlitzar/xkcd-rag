It's not exclusively a \"sex manual,\" as it also contains a guide to virtuous and gracious living, but in the Western world, it's primarily thought of as a manual of exotic sex positions.\n\nGiven that the ''Kama Sutra'' was written almost 2,000 years ago, it's doubtful that it has ''any'' references whatsoever to a skateboard ramp, but Cueball and Megan enjoy their badly-translated version of the ''Kama Sutra'' so much that they refuse to change it.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Crisco}}, a brand of {{w|shortening}} that is used in baking, as well as a sexual lubricant. It has been mentioned before in [[330: Indecision]] and later in [[557: Students]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A bed sits on the ground in the middle of the frame. At the left of the frame, Cueball stands atop a skateboard jump ramp twice his height, one foot on the back of a skateboard poised over the coping. At the bottom of the ramp is a small kicker ramp, which will launch him over the bed. Megan, to the right of the frame, stands on the roof of a house grasping a rope, which is affixed directly over the bed. They are both poised to begin their motion.]\n:Our copy of the Kama Sutra has a couple mistranslations.\n:Which we refuse to fix.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Skateboard]]"
