Having taken the first few hits without much reaction, she sighs and then brings out her {{w|super soaker}}, which was first used on her in [[220: Philosophy]] (and later reappears in [[2334: Slide Trombone]]), and soaks him with it. \n\nThe next day, everyone has such guns and starts shooting marshmallows at each other. We see [[Beret Guy]] and Megan who confront Cueball, saying ''Hey, {{w|noob}}! Eat {{w|Stay Puft Marshmallow Man|Stay-Puft®}}!'' This is like saying ''eat lead'' when threatening someone with a regular gun, since Stay Puft is a fictional brand of marshmallows from the ''{{w|Ghostbusters}}'' movie. (Of course, it's also a reasonable thing to say, since marshmallows are edible.{{citation needed}}) These statements and many like them appear in many first-person shooter games with chat.\n\nBeret Guy realizes that the \"streams\" of marshmallows are about to cross and shouts a warning, but it is too late and they cross anyway. This results in something gigantic appearing with a <big>'''Foom'''</big> <small>Roaaar!</small> off-screen. It roars at the three friends. Megan looks up and states that ''this is bad'' as the giant shouts ''You're shooting what?'' Presumably the crossing marshmallow beams have recreated the {{w|Stay Puft Marshmallow Man}} from ''Ghostbusters''. In the movie, crossing the ghost-capturing streams from the {{w|Proton packs|proton packs}} was \"{{w|Proton pack#Crossing the streams|bad}}.\" But in the end, in which an ancient spirit took the form of this giant Marshmallow Man, the monster was destroyed as a side effect of crossing the streams.  The Stay-Puft man sees what they are shooting and is justifiably upset.\n\nThe title text is a further ''Ghostbusters'' reference, as {{w|Bill Murray}} was one of the actors in the movie. Since the crossing of the streams of the proton packs by Bill Murray and the other Ghostbusters is related to the destruction of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in the movie, the crossing of the marshmallow streams in the comic does the opposite and summons an enormous Bill Murray.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A box above the first frame:]\n:I got this gun that shoots marshmallows.\n:[Cueball removes the red marshmallow gun from a box.]\n\n:[Cueball shoots at Megan with marshmallow gun from offscreen.]\n:Pop pop pop\n:Whap whap whap\n\n:[Megan facepalms.]\n:Pop\n:Megan: Sigh.\n\n:[Megan removes a super soaker from desk drawer.]\n:Pop pop\n\n:[Megan shoots Cueball (offscreen) with the super soaker.]\n:Cueball (offscreen): Augh! \n:''Fwoosh''\n:Cueball (offscreen): Man, I forgot that was there.\n\n:[A box above the first frame of the second part of the comic:]\n:The next day, everyone else got them too.\n:[Megan and Beret Guy brandish marshmallow guns.]\n:Megan: Hey, noob!
