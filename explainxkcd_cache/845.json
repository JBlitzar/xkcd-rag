Most renactments are of famous battles in the area, such as the {{w|Battle of Gettysburg}}, or the {{w|The Battle of Hastings}}. The reenactors usually set up camps, and somtimes talk to spectators before the battle and teach them about the time period. Some reenactments can last several days with the reenactors setting up camps and sleeping several nights there.\n\nTheoretical \"real-time\" war reenactment takes this one step further by having someone act out a war that is actually happening at the time. This would be annoying for the actual soldiers, as it would be hard to do your job if someone was right behind you imitating (and distracting) you. It would also be hard for the reenactor to get to the war zone without getting killed or detained, especially if the person the reenactor was imitating gets killed.\n\nThe title text refers to how someone would research the character that someone would play in a normal war reenactment for a more enjoyable and accurate reenactment. Once again, the title text makes a real-time version of this, having someone actually live the life of the real-time fighter. This is not a good idea for several reasons.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Warzone.
