But we've checked your mom's college yearbook photos, and whether or not she and your father had sex, it's clear that... listen, I know this is hard for you.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Genetic testing}} is a medical procedure where researchers analyze your DNA and family history to determine if you have elevated risk factors for diseases such as heart conditions and cancer. Here, the doctor appears to be delivering the results of [[Cueball]]'s genetic test but instead tells him that his parents had sex at some point.\n\nPeople generally don't like thinking about their parents having sex, but it obviously happened, since having sex is usually the precondition for having children, unless they were conceived through IVF, {{Citation needed}} so this test result is completely unsurprising. If the doctor only came to this conclusion after analyzing genes on several of Cueball's chromosomes, this could have been done in order to verify that Cueball's DNA indeed resembles the DNA of his supposed parents i.e., that the people whom he has always viewed as his parents are indeed his genetic parents. However, the alternative might be even more disturbing.\n\nThe title text notes that he could be an {{w|in-vitro fertilization}} baby, which does not require the parents to directly have sex. However, it seems to suggest that Cueball's mother was very attractive in her college years (or that she was pregnant). Thus, Cueball's mother probably did have sex (regardless of whether or not it was with Cueball's father). This is a reference to the stereotype that college students engage in large amounts of sex.{{citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Did my genetic tests come back?\n:Megan: Yeah. Sit down.\n:Cueball: Is it bad news? What are my risk factors?\n\n:[Cueball is now sitting in the chair awaiting her answer. Megan looks down at the clipboard.]\n:Megan: We can't be sure about this, but we've analyzed genes on several of your chromosomes and it's hard to avoid the conclusion:\n\n:[Megan puts down the clipboard and looks at Cueball as she delivers her news. Cueball puts his hands to his face in dismay.]\n:Megan: At some point, your parents had sex.\n:Cueball: Oh God!\n:Megan: Stay calm! It's possible it was just once!\n:Cueball: I... I need to be alone.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Biology]]"
