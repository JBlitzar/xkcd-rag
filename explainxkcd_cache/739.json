An example of a {{w|malapropism}} is {{w|Yogi Berra}}'s statement: \"Texas has a lot of electrical votes,\" rather than \"electoral votes\". A {{w|portmanteau}} is a word made up of two or more combined words. For example, motel is a portmanteau, from the words motor and hotel. A {{w|neologism}} is simply a newly coined word that is not yet in common use. Here, [[Randall]] shows a hypothetical Wikipedia page of the word \"malamanteau\" which is both a portmanteau of \"malapropism\" and \"portmanteau\" and a neologism. The method used to create this new word is one of the very words used in the process. This is called a [[917|meta]] or \"self-referential\" joke.\n\nBy using many large obscure words in one sentence, Randall may also be picking on linguists, [[114|one]] [[1483|of]] his [[1602|favorite]] [[2390|subjects]], who are known for coining and using such words. \"Malamanteau\" was originally coined in 2007, when user [http://www.metafilter.com/user/17900 ludwig_van] proposed it on [http://www.metafilter.com Metafilter] as a term for language errors like \"flustrated\" (flustered & frustrated) and \"misconscrewed\" (misconstrued & screwed). The bottom line of the comic (Ever notice how Wikipedia has a few words it ''really'' likes?) is a reference to a large number of Wikipedia pages that start by labeling their subject matter as a malapropism, a portmanteau, or a neologism. \n\nThe title text refers to Wikipedia's requirements of citations for a page on there to exist. It also refers to the wide range of places citations can be obtained from, showing a direct opposition due to the use of very different citations (The Language Log arguments are modern and informal, whereas the obscure manuscript is formal and much older). The title text also refers to the fact that [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/ Language Log] is frequently used for Wikipedia citations.\n\nLanguage Log is a blog that posts content relating to language and linguistics, including things like malapropisms and portmanteaus. While an informal source, it has produced new linguistic terms before, such as {{w|eggcorn}}. Its comments sections frequently contain discussions and arguments about English, whose participants are probably the same people who write Wikipedia articles about linguistic phenomena like malamanteaus. In actual fact, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2758 Malamanteau] did not appear on Language Log until after this strip. Malamanteau has since been referenced on the Language Log website, with a link to the comic in question. Language Log has referenced xkcd many times before, reposting the comics and linking to the xkcd website.\n\nThe title text jokingly refers to the \"malamanteau\" citations being Language Log references and a document from the 1490s, in reference to the fact that linguists, like those who post on Language Log, often use old documents as evidence, possibly to prove that construction is a longstanding feature of the language. The joke is that the only references to this word or concept are a 500-year-old document and linguists informally arguing about what it means. In reality, if these citations were the only evidence of the term's use, then it would be unlikely to be a notable feature worthy of a Wikipedia article. Most articles that are only cited by a single website tend to get deleted unless the subject has achieved significant coverage in outside news media.\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn response to this comic, the {{w|Malamanteau}} article was created and deleted three times in one day, before being turned into a redirect and listed on {{w|WP:RFD|Wikipedia's Redirects for discussion}}. The {{w|Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2010 May 12#Malamanteau|discussion to delete Malamanteau}} was one of the most epic and passionate ever to take place at RFD, with almost 200 users participating, even despite being closed early. In the end, the redirect to {{w|xkcd}} was kept, but on {{w|Talk:Malamanteau|the talk page}}, the arguments over it rage on. Malamanteau and the controversy at Wikipedia got coverage at ''{{w|The Economist}}'' and ''{{w|The Boston Globe}}'' and is mentioned in the {{w|Wikipedia:Lamest edit wars#Malamanteau|'''Malamanteu''' section}} within the {{w|Wikipedia:Lamest edit wars|Wikipedia page for the lamest edit wars}}\n\nElsewhere on Wikipedia, this comic is used to illustrate the {{w|xkcd#Recurring themes|''Recurring themes'' section}} of the {{w|xkcd}} article; in order for this to be possible, Randall changed the license for this particular comic. This has been explained in a unique [[Header text|header text]] that is only displayed on the [[Header text#Malamanteau|page for Malamanteau]]. In response to two Wikipedia editors jokingly bickering about who invented the word \"malamanteau\" first, Randall replied {{w|User talk:xkcd#Talk:Malamanteau|on his user talk page}}:\n\n{{Quote|I'll happily grant you possession of the word and the accompanying Talk page clusterfuck. As I said in a couple places, there was one hit for the word when I did the comic (yours), which I found after posting and which didn't define it the same way. But I'd be happy to give you credit for coming up with the word before I did (I didn't even mean to invent a word), especially if it means you have to argue about the word's inclusion in Wikipedia. Let's work out an agreement. Can we have your people meet with my people, and then get them to fight to the death in some kind of a cage? I think that would be awesome, as my people are pretty scrappy and I assume yours have been training since at least July 2007.|[[Randall Munroe]]|{{w|User talk:xkcd#Talk:Malamanteau|Source}}}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The strip is set up as the top of a Wikipedia page.]\n:[The Wikipedia logo.]\n:Wikipedia\n:The free encyclopedia\n:[Side navigation options.]\n:Navigation\n:-Main Page\n:-Contents\n:-Featured Content\n:-Current Events [cutoff]\n:[Wikipedia header options.]\n:Article  Discussion  Edit this page [cutoff text: History]\n:[The article itself.]\n:Malamanteau\n:From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n:A malamanteau is a neologism for a portmanteau created by incorrectly combining a malapropism with a neologism.

Incidentally, just a day after the comic’s publication, a new version of the {{w|Wikipedia logo}} was published, and the default skin [[mw:Special:Code/MediaWiki/66383|was switched]] to the \"Vector\" skin. Nowadays, both of these skins are outdated and no longer maintained after Wikipedia underwent a major redesign to increase usability and accessibility.\n\n* Interestingly, the \"f\" in Wikipedia's tagline \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\" is lowercase. This differs from the other letters, which are written in xkcd's standard all-caps font, including the similar phrase under the Wikipedia logo.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://malamanteaus.blogspot.com/ Malamanteaus], a blog dedicated to the creation and proliferation of malamanteaux\n*[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Malamanteau Malamanteau] at urbandictionary.com\n*[http://wordsquirt.com/Word/View/Malamanteau/dbb34d48-e565-4012-bcc8-56718f351712 Malamanteau] at wordsquirt.com\n*[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=malamanteau Entries referencing \"malamanteau\"] at LanguageLog.com\n*Malamanteau Talk Page Archives {{w|Talk:Malamanteau/Archive 1|1}} and {{w|Talk:Malamanteau/Archive 2|2}} at Wikipedia.com\n*{{w|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Malamanteau}}\n*{{w|File:Malamanteau page history.jpg|Screen capture}} of the deleted history for the \"Malamanteau\" page from Wikipedia\n*[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Malamanteau Wikipedia Log for \"Malamanteau\"]\n*Beutler, William (May 5, 2010) \"[http://thewikipedian.net/2010/05/18/much-ado-about-malamanteau/ Much Ado About Malamanteau]\".
