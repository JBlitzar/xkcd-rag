I mean, that'd be a hell of a waste, right?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nWhen asked by [[Megan]] what he's been up to, [[Cueball]] responds with the {{tvtropes|SuspiciouslySpecificDenial|suspiciously specific denial}}, \"Definitely not spending every day consumed with worry over stupid things I never talk to anyone about.\", which suggests that that is exactly what he's been spending every day doing, but he is hiding it from her and everyone else. Megan's response \"Oh, yeah, me neither\" suggests she too is worrying over stupid things but isn't admitting it.\n\nInstead of discussing their mutual worry and possibly making each other feel better, they instead continue to \"not talk to anyone about it\" and stand in {{w|awkward silence}}.\n\nThe title text continues the irony suggesting it's good that they're too smart to spend all day being uselessly frustrated with themselves, but that's apparently exactly what they are doing.\n\nThis could also be a reference to the common response to the question Megan asks in the first panel, \"nothing\", a response that is almost certainly false, and usually means the same thing that Cueball said, but is usually accepted, if not expected.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are chatting. She has hair.]\n:Megan: What've you been up to?\n\n:Cueball: Definitely not spending every day consumed with worry over stupid things I never talk to anyone about.\n\n:Megan: Oh, yeah, me neither.\n:Cueball: That's good.\n:Megan: Yeah.\n\n:[The final panel is silent.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
