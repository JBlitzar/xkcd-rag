(See the usage note under \"Affect.\")\n\nIn careful speech, both words (as verbs) are similar but not identical. \"Affect\" is /əˈfɛkt/ (or uh-'''fekt''') and \"effect\" is /ɪˈfɛkt/ (or ih-'''fekt'''). However, for some people, these words are {{w|homophones}} — it's also explained here: [http://www.writingforward.com/grammar/homophones/homophones-affect-vs-effect homophones affect vs effect].\n\n\"Effect\" is usually a noun, meaning ''a result'', and \"affect\" usually a verb, meaning ''to act upon''. \"Effect\" as a verb has the slightly different meaning ''to bring about''. [[Cueball]] says that the foreign policy ''causes'' the situation, not, as the \"grammar nazi\" thinks, that it ''changes'' the situation.\n\nThe title of the comic translates to ''cause or bring about a result'', which is just what Cueball does! It can also be seen as a play on words, being similar to the phrase \"cause and effect.\"\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Victory marking}} practice common among fighter pilots in a war zone. Fighter pilots who score a \"kill\" on an opposing aircraft will have a silhouette of the downed plane painted on the side of their plane as a way of keeping track of kills. In this sense, Cueball \"shot down,\" figuratively speaking, an online (grammar) nazi, and would mark it by painting a silhouette on the side of his computer.\n\nSee also [[1429: Data]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby:\n:Using the more obscure meanings of \"affect\" and \"effect\" to try to trip up amateur grammar Nazis.\n:Cueball: I think that our foreign policy effects the situation.\n:Grammar Nazi, via Computer: You mean \"affects.\"\n:Cueball: tee hee hee\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
