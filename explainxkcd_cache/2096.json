DISCLOSURE: THE AUTHOR OF THIS MOUSEOVER TEXT RECEIVED FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FROM THE FLOOR INDUSTRY FOR THIS MESSAGE.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nCueball is talking to Ponytail about his mattress, in what appears to be a casual conversation. Cueball suddenly offers to take any questions from listeners, as though the conversation were part of a podcast, which confuses Ponytail. The subtitle explains that Randall has heard so many advertisements for certain products on podcasts that he can't discuss them without feeling as though he's in a podcast himself.  \n\n{{w|Podcast}}s are, usually, audio-only programs available online, which frequently generate income through advertisements. Ads are often read by the podcast host. Hosts will often include segues or personal anecdotes to further reduce the \"topical whiplash\" caused by abruptly switching subjects from that of the podcast to an unrelated brand plug and back.\n\nIn 2018, many podcasts, or at least many podcasts that Randall listens to, contained ads by {{w|Casper Sleep|Casper}} or {{w|Helix Sleep|Helix Sleep}}, both of which are mattress brands, MeUndies or Tommy John, both underwear brands, and {{w|Stamps.com}}, an internet-based mailing/shipping service.\n\nThe title text (here named the mouseover text) refers to [https://www.fastcompany.com/3065928/sleepopolis-casper-bloggers-lawsuits-underside-of-the-mattress-wars \"The War To Sell You A Mattress Is An Internet Nightmare\"], which is an article about the pressures companies put on reviewers, the legal battle between a mattress review site that makes money through affiliate sales, and a mattress company unhappy with a review. Since saying anything unfavorable about mattresses might open one to legal action, the title text author opted to avoid them entirely. However, it turns out this was a sponsored message by the \"floor industry\", and is meant to increase rates of sleeping on the floor. It also references the way that podcast hosts will often note when they intentionally or unintentionally endorse a product sponsor in an attempt to remain transparent about their financial supporters.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball and Ponytail are talking to each other]\n:Cueball: ...It's firmer than my old mattress, which I thought I wouldn't like, but it's actually really nice.\n:Ponytail: Cool, maybe I should get one.\n:Cueball: Now let's take some listener questions!\n:Ponytail: What?\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I can't talk about mattresses, underwear, or the Post Office anymore without feeling the urge to segue back into a podcast.\n\n==Trivia==\nThe image was originally posted as an indexed image with only a 3-color map (white, black, and grey), leading to graphical artifacts in place of a smooth blur between black and white. Most of Randall's comic images are indexed images with over 200 different grayscale colors.
