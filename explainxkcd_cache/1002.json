Computers aren't so much playing as they are recalculating the list of ideal maneuvers. The same could be said for the computer's human opponent, just at a slower pace.\n\n; {{w|Tic-tac-toe}}\n\n: Also known as Noughts and Crosses, it's a pencil-and-paper game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. This game nearly always ends in a tie, regardless of whether humans or computers play it because the total number of positions is small. Randall posted a complete guide to the winning tactics more than a year before as [[832: Tic-Tac-Toe]].\n\n; {{w|Nim}}\n\n: This is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap.\n\n; {{w|Ghost (game)|Ghost}}\n\n: This is a spoken word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment. The loser is the first person who completes a valid word or who creates a fragment that cannot be the start of a word. Randall himself has written a perfect solution to Ghost, [https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/12/31/ghost/ which he posted on his blog]. Depending on the dictionary used, either the first player can always force a win, or the second player can.\n\n; {{w|Connect Four}}\n\n: Also known as Captain's Mistress, it's a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping their colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. Randall made a reference of this game at [[1767: US State Names]].\n\n; {{w|Gomoku}}\n\n: Also known as Gobang, it's an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board (19x19 intersections); however, because once placed, pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game is known in several countries under different names. Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n; {{w|Draughts|Checkers}}\n\n: Also known as Draughts, it's a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces.\n\n===Computers Beat Humans===\n\nThese games have not been \"solved\". Some of them may be solved some day, but the large number of possible moves has so far prevented this from being done. Others cannot be \"solved\" due to the influence of randomness or the existence of multiple \"ideal\" maneuvers for each position. That said, a computer's faster reaction time, higher degree of consistency in making the right decision, and reduced risk of user error make the computer objectively better than the human opponent in nearly all situations.\n\n; {{w|Scrabble}}\n\n: This is a word game in which two to four players score points by forming words from individual lettered tiles on a gameboard marked with a 15-by-15 grid.\n\n; {{w|Counter-Strike|CounterStrike}}\n\n: This refers to the popular multiplayer shooter video game series about terrorists and counter-terrorists. Counter-Strike is notorious for the large variety of cheating tools that have been made for it; a computer would have essentially perfect accuracy and reflexes, essentially making it the {{w|aimbot}} from hell. It is theoretically possible for a skilled player to beat such an AI, but it would be ''extremely'' difficult to do so. {{w|Counter-Strike:_Condition_Zero|Condition Zero}} has pre-set PvE scenarios called \"Deleted Scenes\", but the AI used for enemies isn't particularly skilled and can be beaten by an average player.\n\n; {{w|Beer pong}}\n\n: Also known as Beirut, it's a drinking game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end. [https://youtu.be/HkhMCCOHFmM?t=30s This is the video] of the University of Illinois robot mentioned in the comic.\n\n; {{w|Reversi}}\n\n: Also known as Othello, it's a board game involving abstract strategy and played by two players on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns and a set of distinct pieces for each side. Pieces typically are disks with a light and a dark face, each face belonging to one player. The player's goal is to have a majority of their colored pieces showing at the end of the game, turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.\n\n; {{w|Chess}}\n\n: This is a two-player board game played on a chessboard, a square-checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns, each of these types of pieces moving differently. The note mentions \"the first game to be won by a chess-playing computer against a reigning world champion under normal chess tournament conditions\", in the {{w|Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov}} match on February 10, 1996, and the [http://en.chessbase.com/post/bilbao-the-humans-strike-back Ponomariov vs Fritz] game in the Man vs Machine World Team Championship on November 21, 2005, considered the \"last win by a human against top computer\".\n\n; {{w|Jeopardy!}}\n\n: This is an American quiz show featuring trivia in history, literature, the arts, pop culture, science, sports, geography, wordplay, and more. The show has a unique answer-and-question format in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in question form. Ken Jennings, mentioned in the title text, is a famous Jeopardy champion who was beaten by {{w|Watson (computer)|Watson}}, an IBM computer. This was [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html an exhibition match] featuring Jennings, Brad Rutter, and Watson that took place in February 2011.\n\n===Humans Beat Computers===\n\nThese games are incredibly difficult to \"solve\" due to the near-infinite number of possible positions. Computers built in the early 21st century would take years to calculate a single \"ideal\" move. Worse, the human opponent has the ability to \"bluff\"; that is, to make a bad move, thus baiting the computer into a trap. Complex algorithms have been devised to make moves in a reasonable timeframe, but so far they are all highly vulnerable to bluffing. As mentioned in the comic, focused research and development is working on refining these algorithms to play the games better.\n\n; {{w|StarCraft}}\n\n: This is a military real-time strategy video game series. The game revolves around three species, Terran (humans), Zerg, and Protoss, fighting for dominance in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector. Players must gather resources, build buildings and units, attack the opponent's base, and defend their base. While even average Starcraft players can defeat the AIs that originally shipped with the games, Starcraft has since been adopted as a standard benchmark for AI research, largely because of its excellent balance. Thanks to that attention, computers can now defeat at least 99.8% of all players, and the trend does not look promising for humans.\n\n; {{w|Poker}}\n\n: This is a family of card games involving betting and individualistic play whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards, some of which remain hidden until the end of the game. It is also, however, a game of deception and intimidation, the ubiquitous \"poker face\" being considered the most important part of the game. '''Update:''' In a 20-day poker tournament from January 11 to 31, 2017, the poker AI {{w|Libratus}} [https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/31/14451616/ai-libratus-beat-humans-poker-cmu-tournament won against four top-class human poker players]. Libratus only works for the Heads-Up (two-player) variant of poker, which is not the most commonly played variant, so humans are still ahead of computers for now.\n\n; {{w|Arimaa}}\n\n: Arimaa is a game which can be played with traditional chess pieces. It was invented by Omar Syed, with the explicit goal of being more difficult to AIs than regular chess while still being able to be learned by his 4-year-old son Aamir. He was motivated to create the game by the famous chess match between {{w|Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|Deep Blue and Gary Kasparov}}. '''Update:''' on April 18, 2015, a computer won [https://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/ the \"Arimaa Challenge\"], so this comic is now out of date with respect to Arimaa.\n\n; {{w|Go (game)|Go}}\n\n: This is an ancient board game for two players that originated in China more than 2,000 years ago. The game is noted for being rich in strategy despite its relatively simple rules. The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones on the vacant intersections (called \"points\") of a grid of 19×19 lines (beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards). The object of the game is to use one's stones to control a larger amount of territory of the board than the opponent. That computers would soon beat humans was the subject in [[1263: Reassuring]]. '''Update:''' on March 15, 2016, Google's {{w|AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol|AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol}}, who was often seen as the dominant human player over the last decade, 4 games to 1 in a widely viewed match, and {{w|Computer Go}} was expected to become more dominant over time. In May 2017, Google's AI AlphaGo [http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-ai-becomes-world-s-top-ranking-go-player-1.3097756 defeated the world's top human Go player]. This was referenced three months later in [[1875: Computers vs Humans]].\n\n===Computers cannot compete===\nThese are the games Randall believes computers will never be able to beat, mainly because they depend on elements that go beyond logic and calculation. Unlike traditional games where a clear strategy or set of rules can be mastered by AI, these ones often involve unpredictable human choices, creative thinking, or social interactions.\n\n; {{w|Snakes and Ladders}}\n\n: Also known as Chutes and Ladders, it's an ancient Indian {{w|race game}}, where the moves are decided entirely by die rolls or other random number generators. (However, any person or computer choosing the numbers needed directly is called \"cheating\".) A number of tiles are connected by pictures of ladders and snakes (or chutes) which makes the game piece jump forward or backward, respectively. Since the game is decided by pure chance, it occupies the limbo where a computer will always be ''exactly'' as likely to win as a human (indeed, Randall's arrow points at the dividing line between 'humans beat computers' and 'computers cannot compete').\n\n; {{w|Mao (card game)|Mao}}\n\n: This is a card game similar to {{w|Crazy Eights}} or {{w|Uno}}, with the twist that new players aren't told any of the rules and have to deduce them by trial and error. (The rules are sometimes summarized as \"The only rule I can tell you is this one\"). The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand, at which point that player invents a new rule and adds it to the ones already in the game. Computers would have a difficult time integrating into Mao as they would need a complicated learning engine capable of deducing rules with no prior training, and would also need the ability to be able to invent rules itself.\n\n; {{w|Seven minutes in heaven|Seven Minutes in Heaven}}\n\n: This is a teenagers' party game first recorded as being played in Cincinnati in the early 1950s. Two people are selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space and do whatever they like for seven minutes. Sexual activities are allowed; however kissing and making out are more common. Because this is not a competitive game, players cannot \"outplay\" or \"lose to\" each other, regardless of whether they are humans or computers. Additionally, as the game is focused on human interaction, there's not a whole lot a modern computer can ''do'' in the closet. It would need some kind of robotic body in order to interact with its human partner, and emotion engines that could feel pleasure and displeasure in order to make decisions. The title text claims that {{w|Honda|Honda Motor Company}} has invented a \"{{w|RealDoll}}\" (sex toy shaped like a mannequin) with rudimentary Seven Minutes in Heaven capabilities, but they pale in comparison to a human's (specifically, Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings).\n\n; {{w|Calvin and Hobbes#Calvinball|Calvinball}}\n\n: This is a reference to the comic strip {{w|Calvin and Hobbes}} by {{w|Bill Watterson}}. Calvinball is a game played by {{w|Calvin and Hobbes}} as a rebellion against organized team sports; according to Hobbes, \"No sport is less organized than Calvinball!\" Calvinball was first introduced to the readers at the end of a 1990 storyline involving Calvin reluctantly joining recess baseball. It quickly became a staple of the comic afterwards. The only hint at the true creation of the game ironically comes from the last Calvinball strip, in which a game of football quickly devolves into a game of Calvinball. Calvin remarks that \"sooner or later, all our games turn into Calvinball,\" suggesting a similar scenario that directly led to the creation of the sport. Calvin and Hobbes usually play by themselves, although in one storyline Rosalyn (Calvin's baby-sitter) plays in return for Calvin doing his homework, and plays very well once she realizes that the rules are made up on the spot.\n\n:The only consistent rules state that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice, and you need to wear a mask, no questions asked. Scoring is also arbitrary, with Hobbes at times reporting scores of \"Q to 12\" and \"oogy to boogy.\" The only recognizable sports Calvinball resembles are the ones it emulates (i.e., a cross between croquet, polo, badminton, capture the flag, and volleyball.) The game is a manifestation of chaos and the human imagination, far beyond the meager capabilities of silicon and circuitry, at least so far. The closest thing you could possibly get is having an AI automatically generate rules on the fly, similar to something like the currently-existent {{w|AI Dungeon}} or a similarly robust text algorithm; but even still, the computer would be unable to ''act'' upon these new rules in that state.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A diagram with a caption above the diagram.
