And she is not even finished when Cueball breaks into her endless list after she once again says ''tools for'' by asking ''what is it for?'' (See also: [[1579: Tech Loops]]).\n\nMegan readily admits that she doesn't even know the goal of these tasks, and guesses that it is probably for porn, referencing the not-entirely-unfounded stereotype that {{tvtropes|TheInternetIsForPorn|the majority of internet traffic is pornographic websites}}. Knowing that many information technologies, from printing to computers, are quickly adopted by porn producers and distributors, this is not a bad guess on Megan's part. Further, many internet related advances have had their way paved by a porn industry that needed secure and secret payments options, and better bandwidth for downloading films, as well as making it more accessible, etc. \n\nIn the title text there is a recursion as someone (maybe Cueball) tells what they do. And in this case they make tools for managing job-hunting sites for people who make tools for managing job-hunting sites for people who make tools for ... (ad infinitum). See also other [[:Category:Recursion|comics about Recursion]]. \n\nRegarding porn in xkcd see also [[305: Rule 34]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball talks to Megan.]\n:Cueball: What do you do?\n:Megan: I make tools that make tools\n\n:[Megan continues talking to Cueball in this frameless image.]\n:Megan: ...That monitor code that deploys tools that build tools for deploying monitors...\n\n:[Cueball finally stops Megan from talking. At the top there is a small frame with a caption overlaid on the top frame:]\n:20 minutes later...\n:Megan: ...For monitoring deployment of tools for-\n:Cueball: But what's it all '''''for?'''''\n:Megan: Honestly, no idea.
