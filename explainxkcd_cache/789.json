Commonly, to accentuate the silence and dreariness of the scene before the fight, a {{w|tumbleweed}} would roll past the fighters. In this comic, the two gunmen, as per the cliche, stand quietly. The tumbleweed then rolls past, and pulls a pair of revolvers. It then shoots both of the gunfighters simultaneously, winning the duel. This is somewhat unusual, as tumbleweeds don't appear to be able to use revolvers.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text refers to a common trope in Westerns to have the hero (or in this case, the tumbleweed) ride (roll) into the sunset at the conclusion of the film. Since the sun rises in the east and set in the west, the tumbleweed would have to roll westward. However, given that prevailing winds go from west to east, that means that the tumbleweed would be unable to tumble into the sunset and be prevented from fulfilling this trope.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two cowboys face off silently in the desert, the blazing sun beating down.]\n\n:[They exchange steely glares, hands poised to reach their guns, as a tumbleweed rolls into frame, with a helicoidal line depicting its movement.]\n:''TUMBLE''\n\n:[Close-up on the tumbleweed.
