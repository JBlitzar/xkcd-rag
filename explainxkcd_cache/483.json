I'm looking at you, Anathem.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Randall]] uses a graph that purports that the more words an author makes up, the less likely their book is any good. To demonstrate this, he provides an example where a hypothetical author uses three made-up words in a single sentence: \"Fra'as\", \"Farmlings\", and \"Krytoses\". The author clearly does not see that having to insert explanations of all the made-up words makes the sentence extremely clumsy.\n\nThe title text declares that the average author is allowed five invented words per book before this rule is invoked against them, but mentions that {{w|J.R.R. Tolkien}} and {{w|Lewis Carroll}} are exceptions, as they are both very famous, well-respected writers {{w|Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|who made words up}} {{w|Jabberwocky|all the time}}.\n\nRandall also makes a dig at ''{{w|Anathem}}'', a speculative fiction novel by {{w|Neal Stephenson}} about a monastic order on another planet that studies science, mathematics, and philosophy. The book is noteworthy for having a very large number of {{tvtropes|CallARabbitASmeerp|made-up or repurposed words,}} enough to require its own glossary. One of the more common other-worldly words is ''fraa'' (without an apostrophe), as an analogue to \"{{wiktionary|friar#Noun|friar}}\"/\"{{wiktionary|fr√®re#French|brother}}\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Line graph shown with an inverse curve.]\n:[Y-Axis: Probability book is good.]\n:[X-Axis: Number of words made up by author.]\n:[The curve becomes less steep as the number of words increases.]\n:\"The Elders, or ''Fra'as,'' guarded the ''farmlings'' (children) with their ''krytoses,'' which are like swords but ''awesomer''...\"\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:LOTR]]"
