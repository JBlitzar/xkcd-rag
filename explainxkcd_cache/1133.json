This comic is a diagram of the {{w|Saturn V}} rocket. \"Saturn\" isn't a very common word apparently, and neither is rocket, so Randall decided to use \"Up Goer\" which is a fair approximation of a craft designed to lift a payload from Earth to space. The Saturn V vehicle, used by {{w|NASA}} from 1967 to 1972, is the vehicle as a whole, while the engines of the Saturn V (the part that makes it go up) were divided into three stages. The first stage ({{w|S-IC}}) had five {{w|F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1}} engines which burned {{w|RP-1|refined kerosene}} mixed with oxygen as its fuel. That stage burned for 2 minutes 48 seconds and pushed the whole thing up about 61 kilometers (~38 miles) into the sky. After it fell away the {{w|S-II}} stage was activated. It used 5 {{w|J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2}} engines in the same configuration as the F-1s, and burned {{w|liquid hydrogen}} mixed with {{w|liquid oxygen}} for 6 minutes 35 seconds pushing the astronauts up to 184 kilometers (114.5 miles). The third stage ({{w|S-IVB}}) was a single J-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. This stage was used in two parts, the first was to put the spacecraft into a stable orbit around Earth to perform a systems check and make sure the craft will be safe for going to the moon. This would usually take three orbits around Earth. As they came around the Earth they would burn the second part of the fuel, which is called a {{w|trans-lunar injection}} which put them on course for the moon. The first burn took 2 minutes 45 seconds, which put them in orbit 185 kilometers (115 miles) high.\n\nIt was first used as the launch vehicle for the {{w|Apollo 4}} mission, and it was used as the launch vehicle for most of the subsequent {{w|Apollo mission}}s (the exceptions being Apollo 5, Apollo 7, Skylab 2-4, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project missions, which were launched using the smaller {{w|Saturn IB}} launch vehicle). One of the last missions of this design was the unmanned launch of {{w|Skylab}}, the U.S.'s first space station; for this payloader configuration, the Saturn V launch vehicle was officially designated the {{w|Saturn INT-21}}.\n\nThe Service Module (SM) Oxygen tanks have a note that states \"This part had a ''VERY'' big problem once\". This is a reference to the {{w|Apollo 13}} mission. 55 hours after launch, mission control requested the oxygen tanks contents be stirred to get an accurate reading of its contents. There was {{w|Apollo 13#Oxygen tank explosion|a large bang}}, and power fluctuated throughout the craft. NASA had to scramble to ensure the safe return of the astronauts. Needless to say, the moon landing for that mission was canceled.\n\nThe {{w|Hindenburg disaster}} is referenced in the text \"The kind of air that once burned a big sky bag and people died and someone said \"oh, the [humans]!\". The term \"big sky bag\" is used as the closest approximation of {{w|zeppelin}} which is a big bag filled with a lighter-than-air gas which makes the whole contraption float. The phrase \"oh, the [humans]\" is a workaround of the simple-words rule, technically containing only the word humans, while being read \"concentration of humans\" or \"humanity\". The {{w|LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg}} on the day of the disaster was filled with {{w|hydrogen}}, despite being initially designed for use with {{w|helium}}. Helium cannot catch fire as it is a {{w|noble gas}} and thus completely inert, but helium was unavailable due to a US export ban on the element. The risks seemed acceptable at the time because the Germans had a history of flying hydrogen-based passenger airships. The original quote is \"Oh, the humanity!\" (See this video about the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F54rqDh2mWA Hindenburg disaster] - the quote appears at 0:47). In the book ''[[Thing Explainer]]'' in the explanation for ''The pieces everything is made of'' (i.e. the {{w|Periodic table}}) hydrogen is again \"named\" by using a picture of the burning Hindenburg and also this quote is said by [[Cueball]] standing next to the square with the element with his hands over his mouth. See more below regarding the book.\n\nThe bottom tank, which Randall describes as \"...full of that stuff they burned in lights before houses had power\" is highly refined kerosene, called {{w|RP-1}}, it is similar to jet fuel, burns well and is not likely to explode; unlike {{w|liquid hydrogen}}, which is much more likely to explode.\n\nThe phrase \"You will not go to space today\" has become something of a catchphrase for xkcd — variants of it recur in the title text of images in four [[What If? chapters|''what if?'' articles]]:\n\n*Building a jetpack out of AK-47s and converting the potential energy. ''{{what if|21|Machine Gun Jetpack}}''\n\n*The one about flying on other planets (the pilot does not want to go to space today.) ''{{what if|30|Interplanetary Cessna}}''\n\n*Launching into Earth orbit (if your rocket cannot hit the right \"horizontal\" speed, you will go to space today, and then you will quickly come back.) ''{{what if|58|Orbital Speed}}''\n\n*The Pyramid of Giza (the energy that made it is not nearly enough to launch a rocket into space; the title text has another reference to the comic, noting that the tip of the pyramid should point towards space.) ''{{what if|95|Pyramid Energy}}''\n\nThing Explainer was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt on November 24, 2015, and actually had a copy of this comic in it. On the day of the book's release Randall also released a comic with a game, to celebrate the book: [[1608: Hoverboard]]. In this game the [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e2/1608_0976x1079y_Space_capsule_with_parachutes.png space capsule] used for landing back on earth is shown, thus both referencing the book and this comic. This part of the space ship can also be seen in the book above the ''Sky toucher'' and the moon landing is also depicted in ''Worlds around the sun''. When the book was released Randall had ''Minute Physics'' do a \"commercial\" [https://youtu.be/2p_8gx-XHJo version of this comic].\n\nThe news about the upcoming release of the book was sent out on the [[Blag]] in May as [https://blog.xkcd.com/2015/05/13/new-book-thing-explainer/ New book: Thing Explainer]. After that, the book was advertised at the top of the xkcd page with link to the Blag article and links to Preorder at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Indie Bound, and Hudson. Also, there were two other news with links: \"In other news, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrdAvmr-MA Space Weird Thing is delightful], and I feel surprisingly invested in [https://twitter.com/xkcdbracket @xkcdbracket's] results.\" (The link was removed sometimes before Monday the 10th of August 2015. within two weeks of the brackets final result was revealed.)\n\nEarlier flirts with simple words can be found in [[547: Simple]] and [[722: Computer Problems]]. The use of simple words would later be revisited again in [[1436: Orb Hammer]] and [[1322: Winter]]. The song ''Space Weird Thing'' is a tribute to {{w|David Bowie}}'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D67kmFzSh_o Space Oddity] rewritten in the simple language used in this comic, which is also attributed in the text about the YouTube video. The other news item is related to [[1529: Bracket]], see that comic for more details. The comic is based on NASA-MSFC 10M04574 produced at Marshal Space Flight Center. Randall omitted the \"S\". The image was for sale as a poster from [http://up-ship.com up-ship.com] which Randal mentioned.
