One aspect of the scientific method is the replication of results, so the failure to replicate some results casts doubt on the validity of the results and scientific knowledge built on them. Research into the replication crisis itself [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/replication-crisis has been done], with a number of studies being redone and the results compared with the original studies. In this comic, a research team is looking to see if the situation has improved and end up \"reproducing\" the same results of the early reproduction crisis papers. \n\nThe joke is about reproducing a paper about being unable to reproduce papers, while both papers show there is general issue with reproducibility, in this narrow case the scientists were able to reproduce an earlier result, hence the \"solved\" newspaper headline.\n\nThere is a further possible jab: the replication crisis has indeed been \"solved\", in that the paper authors have shown that the same problems crop up even when scientists are aware of the issue. The \"solution\" is that the problems persist whether or not the scientists are aware of the replication crisis, so one could simply do science as if the crisis did not happen. This would be not so much a 'solution' as a counsel of despair. [[1574: Trouble for Science]] explores an issue similar to this comic's.\n\nThe title text refers to one previously suggested remedy when the replication crisis was first being dealt with â€” encouraging the publication of null results to counteract {{w|publication bias}}. However, because there is still a replication crisis it didn't solve the problem. The joke is that researchers, being human, are often tempted not to publish results if, for example, the results are not what they were expecting, opposed to a hypothesis they've spoken in favor of, likely to hurt their careers or embarrass them, confusing or difficult for them to explain, or aesthetically or in some other way displeasing to the researcher or their funder.  Similarly to these actual efforts to counteract publication bias, this proposed measure extends this idea, albeit in a way that might sound silly.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Megan, Ponytail, and Cueball are standing at a lectern. Ponytail is talking into the microphone.]\n:Ponytail: In the early 2010s, researchers found that many major scientific results couldn't be reproduced. \n\n:[Ponytail turns her head slightly to look around the room.] \n:Ponytail: Over a decade into the replication crisis, we wanted to see if today's studies have become more robust.\n:[Ponytail looks back at the original place she was looking]\n:Ponytail: Unfortunately, our replication analysis has found exactly the same problems that those 2010s researchers did. \n\n:[This panel shows a newspaper, with title \"NEWS\" surrounded by flourishes. There is a photo of the panel #2 without the text.  There is much illegible text around the picture.
