In this case, he treats his immune system as he would a child trying to accomplish something difficult, and worries about its emotional reaction. \n\nThe [[:Category:COVID-19 vaccine|COVID-19 vaccine]]s (like all viral inoculations) work by introducing viral proteins into the body, causing the immune system to react as if the actual virus were present, creating the antibodies to fight it. As a result, if the actual virus is introduced, the immune system will have the capacity to quickly eliminate it. \n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] has just received the COVID-19 vaccine and anthropomorphizes this process. He worries that his immune system is \"freaking out\", as the vaccine causes the body to 'think' it's under attack and respond as it would to a deadly threat. Cueball accordingly tries to reassure his immune system that the threat isn't real. However, [[Megan]] reminds him that the \"panic\" is the entire point, as that's what causes the body to build defenses, which will allow it to handle the real virus. Cueball then switches tactics, melodramatically announcing that the virus is about to kill him, and encouraging his \"heroic immune cells\" to save the day. The joke is that the basic elements of their response is accurate: the vaccine is essentially a ruse intended to \"trick\" the immune system into developing antibodies. However, the immune system obviously lacks a separate consciousness, and can neither hear nor understand their comments,{{Citation needed}} making both reassurance and encouragement entirely moot.   \n\nIn the title text, Cueball continues to treat his immune system like a conscious entity. Specifically, all of his communications sound like a parent, or other adult, trying to encourage a child who was trying to win a game: giving it a pep talk about how he doesn't care if it wins or loses as long as it has fun. This is a common refrain when parents or other adults try to reassure children in contexts where victory isn't especially important, and where enjoyment is the real goal. Cueball then remembers that this particular event is much more consequential. If his immune system were to 'lose' to the vaccine, that would presumably mean it was incapable of responding properly to the viral threat, meaning he'd be in serious risk of death if he contracted the actual virus. As a result, he corrects himself and states that winning, in this case, is \"very important\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is walking toward Cueball, who is holding his arm.]\n:Megan: How you feeling?\n:Cueball: Not bad. Tired. A little sore.\n\n:[Zoom in on Cueball. He looks down at his arms, which are held out.]\n:Cueball: I feel bad for my immune system. It doesn't know this isn't a real virus. It must be freaking out. \n:Cueball: Hey buddy, don't worry! We're going to be fine. This is just practice!\n\n:[Zoom out. Megan gestures at Cueball, as he holds his arm.]\n:Megan: No, don't tell it ''that''. You '''''want''''' it to panic and build defenses that will be able to handle the real thing.\n:Cueball: I guess. \n:Cueball: Okay, let me try that again. \n:Cueball: *ahem*\n\n:[Cueball dramatically clutches at his chest.]\n:Cueball: Woe! My arm is stricken by a dreadful plague! \n:Cueball: I feel death draw near! My only hope is those heroic immune cells!\n:Megan: Perfect.\n:Cueball: <small>''Psst - you're doing great! I'm so proud of you.''</small>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:COVID-19]]\n[[Category:COVID-19 vaccine]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
