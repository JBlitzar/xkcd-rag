I shouldn't have listened to the 70's hit marathon on the way home from work the night before.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic provides alternate lyrics to the chorus of the 1975 song \"{{w|50 Ways to Leave Your Lover}}\" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABXtWqmArUU Video]) by American artist {{w|Paul Simon}}. Both the original and alternate lyrics provide a textual hook because the name at the end of the line is rhymed with the word before it (back/Jack, plan/Stan, go/Joe).\n\n[[Randall]], we learn from the title text, heard Simon's song during a '70s hit marathon, went to sleep, and while being tired replaced \"lover\" by \"hover\" while writing the last line of the song's chorus. Thus changing this line from ''to leave your lover'' into ''to learn to hover''. Clearly, this amused him so much that he decided to create a comic where people learn how to hover, rather than leave their lover.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two figures stand around a levitating person.]\n:You gotta let go, Joe\n:Just rise off your feet, Pete\n:Just stay in the air, Claire\n:Gotta levitate, Kate\n:There must be 50 ways\n:To learn to hover.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
