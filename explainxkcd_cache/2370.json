Saying that one event is more likely to happen than another is not the same as saying that the first event is definitely going to happen. A statement like \"event A has a 70% probability of happening\" sometimes misleads people into believing that event A is inevitable, while in fact 3 times out of 10 event A will not happen.\n\nFor example, FiveThirtyEight [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/ famously gave Trump a higher odds, 28.6%] of winning the 2016 U.S. presidential election than most other models did just before the election, but still not more likely than his opponent. However, many readers at the time interpreted that as \"Trump is definitely going to lose\", and after he won that election, blasted FiveThirtyEight for getting its prediction \"wrong\". However, that interpretation is mistaken. 28.6% means Trump had a real chance at winning: if you could put election results in a hat and draw them at random, he would win two out of every seven tries. For another example, in tabletop gaming terms, Trump's likelihood of winning was slightly lower than that of passing a flat check with a DC of 15 (6/20 or 30%).\n\nSo, the correct interpretation of a probability statement like \"event A has a 70% probability to happen\" is that in the long run, about 70% of events with this probability end up happening. \n\nIn the last panel, it is shown that [[Cueball]] anticipated this lack of understanding, so he plays pre-recorded audio of his prediction for the conversation.\n\nThe title text says that these people are gullible enough to the point that they would accept a disadvantageous bet. However, it also says that the probability that they might not actually go through with paying the bet if they lose brings into question whether to propose the bet is actually worth it. Randall has previously made allusions to betting on fallaciously claimed probabilities in comics such as [[1132: Frequentists vs. Bayesians]] and [[955: Neutrinos]].\n\nAt the time of writing, the 2020 United States presidential and congressional elections are less than a month away. This is a time when polls showing one or the other candidate leading are common, and may be misinterpreted to mean that the candidate is certain to win. Additionally, after the 2016 election saw Donald Trump, the trailing candidate in the polls, winning, many also interpreted this to mean that the polls were useless and/or wrong, or even go beyond this and take an adverse poll prediction as a perversely authoritative indication that the exact opposite result (which they would favour) is now a certainty. Cueball has previously shown an interest in U.S. election polling, for example in [[500: Election]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat and Cueball standing next to each other.
