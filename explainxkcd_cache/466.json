One of the consequences of moving one's place of residence is having to arrange connection to various essential utilities, including the internet.  One way to reduce the time where such utilities are unavailable is to steal them off your neighbors.  As geeks prioritize access to internet over common human values, they are more likely to access other's internet via such underhanded means.\n\nA {{w|cantenna}} is a do-it-yourself antenna made from a can, in this case a {{w|Pringles}} can. [[Cueball]] is pointing his cantenna to the neighbors across the road, which, as he says, will allow him to connect to the {{w|Wi-Fi}} network there.\n\n[[Megan]] asks if the neighbors themselves have internet access, to which Cueball answers that they don't, but he thinks that they will get hooked up to the internet first.  Potentially this is because they are more likely to pay for their internet access rather than hacking someone else's.\n\nThe title text continues this theme of connecting to other people's networks, noting that we should have a holiday in honor of those people who don't bother reconfiguring their {{w|Linksys}} routers (thus leaving them with the default name of 'linksys'; this was very common when this comic was published in 2008), which allows other people to connect to those networks very easily, as they aren't encrypted by default and don't need a password.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:There are few forces more powerful than geeks desperately trying to get internet in a new apartment.\n:[Cueball is pointing an empty can out the open window. It is placed on a moving box, and lots of small parts are lying on the floor in the otherwise empty room.
