A license plate is sometimes included to allow the owner to identify that it is specifically their car that is involved.\n\nIn this case, [[Black Hat]] is up to his old ways as, in addition to announcing that an SRT-10 has its lights on, he also announces that it has had its windshield smashed with a golf club. Black Hat is, of course, holding a golf club, frustrated at the ownerâ€™s revolting arrogance. The lights are probably on because the attack triggered the car's alarm system.\n\nThe {{w|Dodge Viper}} SRT-10 was a version of the Dodge Viper available on the third and fourth generations of Viper from 2003-2010. It was a very expensive sports car.\n\nThe two license plates in the comic are personalized license plates. The one in the comic-proper is clearly \"My Toy\"; the plate in the title text is most likely \"Dad's Money,\" which [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] suggests is a real plate on a car outside his building, suggesting that the driver's father paid for the car, bragging about how rich their family is.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is holding a golf club and speaking into a P.A. system.]\n:Black Hat: Attention,\n:Black Hat: To the owner of a Dodge Viper SRT-10 with license plate \"MYTOY,\" your lights are on and your windshield was just smashed with a golf club.\n\n{{comic discussion}} \n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
