Watching this, [[Ponytail]] and [[Cueball]] compare the words they were assigned when ''they'' got their linguistics degrees, '{{wiktionary|jackalope}}' and '{{wiktionary|slurp}}' respectively. Ponytail thinks bassoon is a cool word but thinks her own is better, whereas Cueball is not satisfied with his word. A bassoon is a woodwind musical instrument with a double reed, while a jackalope is a mythical creature, a ''jackrabbit'' crossed with an ''antelope''. \"Slurp\" is an onomatopoeia associated with eating or drinking loudly.\n\nIt is never clarified what being \"in charge of\" a word entails. It could mean being in charge of keeping track of the word, or having actual authority over the use of the word, which is unlikely as normally [[1726|language use cannot be dictated by a single person]]. Also, no specific university has control over all of linguistics as far as we know, so it would require every university capable of giving people linguistics degrees to co-operate, so nobody is assigned the same word.  Any well-educated member of the linguistic community will know what is being suggested is impossible hence why they are the only ones aware of how important it is.\n\nThe title text merely furthers how seemingly random the entire situation is. The word \"linguistics\" was assigned to a \"random student in Ohio who barely graduated and then went into automotive marketing\", who we can assume isn't very important to the field of linguistics.{{Citation needed}} But this means that no one is actually taking care of this important word, since it must be assumed that the student is no longer interested in linguistics.\n\nThe idea of individuals having a guardianship of an idea or concept has appeared in science fiction.  For example, in ''{{w|Fahrenheit 451}}'' characters have memorized books to save them from book-burning and... spoiler-stuff.\n\nIt also exists in reality. Members of the {{w|Royal Spanish Academy}}, the institution that defines the official dictionary of the Spanish language, are symbolically put in charge of one letter of the dictionary each to take care of it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan, who is wearing a graduation cap, receives a degree which is handed to her by Hairbun. They are standing on a podium with Ponytail and Cueball standing below as onlookers.]\n:Hairbun: Congratulations on the degree! Your word is \"Bassoon.\"\n:Ponytail: Oh nice! Not as cool as my \"Jackalope,\" but still not bad.\n:Cueball: You all are lucky. I'm stuck with \"Slurp.\"\n\n:[Caption below panel:]\n:Every linguistics degree comes with one word that you're put in charge of.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]"
