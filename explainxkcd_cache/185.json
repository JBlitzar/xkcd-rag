    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 185\n| date      = November 17, 2006 \n| title     = Wikifriends\n| image     = wikifriends.png\n| titletext = It's crazy how much my gut opinion of a movie/song is swayed by what other people say, regardless of how I felt coming out of the theater.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic's title refers to {{w|Wiki}}s, which are collaboratively edited websites (such as this one). The first such site was {{w|WikiWikiWeb}}, but {{w|Wikipedia}} (an online encyclopedia) has become the most well-known example, and may have been specifically what [[Randall]] had in mind while drawing this comic, as other comics also reference Wikipedia.\n\nThe influence of social environment is called {{w|peer pressure}}, often with a negative connotation. The term \"Wikifriends\" is coined in the comic as a label for people who adjust their views in order to incorporate into a group. That is to say that, in the same way a Wiki page can be edited by people other than the original author, a \"Wikifriend\" allows their opinions to be \"edited\" by someone else. As an example, the comic shows a discussion about a movie in which one contributor changes his opinion entirely when he hears what his friend thinks.\n\nThe title text suggests that Randall also sees himself as being frequently influenced by others.\n\n==Transcript==\n:WikiFriends:\n:[Two people are talking to each other.]\n:Cueball: I really liked that movie.\n:Friend: I hated that movie.\n:Cueball: Me too.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
