Astronomers {{w|Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown}} and {{w|Konstantin Batygin}} published a paper on 2016-01-20, only two days before the release of this comic. The paper is called ''[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22 Evidence for a Distant Giant Planet in the Solar System]'' and shows indirect evidence that such a planet may exist, inferred from an otherwise unlikely correlation between the unusual orbits of several {{w|dwarf planets}}. See for instance also explanations, for the layman, of the results here: ''[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/feature-astronomers-say-neptune-sized-planet-lurks-unseen-solar-system Astronomers say a Neptune-sized planet lurks beyond Pluto]'' and ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGfv3Oay_pY Planet X Discovered??]''\n\nAs this paper came out on the day of the previous comic's release ([[1632: Palindrome]]), this comic's release day was the first release day after the news came out. This explains why this comic was released in the late afternoon rather than just past midnight as is often the case with normal releases. \nOnce [[Randall]] heard this news, he had to decide to do this comic instead of the scheduled comic, and then invent and draw a completely new and actually very complicated comic (resulting in [[#Info on new version|several position errors]]) about \"{{w|Planet X}}\" before he could release this comic. \n\nNow this planet could be called Planet IX (and is labeled ''Planet nine?'' on the chart), as {{w|Pluto}}, the previously \"planet 9\" has been degraded to a dwarf planet. The \"X\" did, however, not only refer to the roman numeral! Note that Mike Brown is the astronomer that {{w|How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming|killed Pluto}}, or at least reduced Pluto to a dwarf planet, something that has been a subject in [[xkcd]] before; see for instance [[473: Still Raw]].\n\nThis was the first of two times within a month where a new astronomical announcement (of something discovered months before the actual announcement) resulted in a related comic. The second being [[1642: Gravitational Waves]]. But in that case Randall seemed to know about it in advance, as he even changed the normal release schedule to post the comic on the day of the announcement, unlike here, where he seems to have been forced to make a new comic up on the fly.\n\nStating the obvious, this {{w|log–log plot}} shows that for an object to be an unknown planet it has to be very far away, since planets are big, to explain why we haven't seen it yet. With the log scale it is possible to go from a diameter of less than 1&nbsp;mm to an {{w|astronomical unit}} (AU) on the Y-axis and from a distance of just 1&nbsp;cm up to thousands of AU on the X-axis.\n\nRandall's chart is somewhat humorously parochial (if not downright {{w|egocentric}}) in that it purports to measure distance not \"from Earth\" or from an arbitrary observer, but specifically from himself (\"from me\"). There is also more detail (e.g. a differentiation between bird, bugs, and skin flora) in the zone closest to the observer, somewhat reminiscent of the classic New Yorker cover illustration ''{{W|View of the World from 9th Avenue}}''.\n\nThe distance calculations are somewhat problematic (see more on this below). Close distances seem to be measured from the surface of Randall's body (skin/eyes) rather than from his center of mass. All the planets (and moon) that are marked on the chart are so far away that it will not matter if the distance is measured from Randall's surface, his center of mass, or by the way anywhere on {{w|Earth}}. Also, the planets' diameters are so much smaller than the distance from Earth that their real size would hardly take up any space in the chart due to the {{w|Logarithmic scale|log-scale}}. The dots marking these 7 planets are thus not drawn to scale that should represent their actual size compared with the other planets. But their distance from Earth (and Randall) is not constant even on the log-scale, especially not for the nearest planets, as they can be on either side of the {{w|Sun}} compared to Earth.\n\nThe chart correctly states that if there was a planet that was at a distance from him smaller than its diameter, he would be inside it (although at the bottom of that region, it's more like the planet that would be inside him, as this line goes down to a diameter of 1&nbsp;cm). If the distance is to the planets center, this would also fit if he was only a radius away from the planet. As Randall is not inside the Earth but really close to it, Earth is correctly positioned on this line. However, for Earth, which is marked with the largest of the dots, he seems to have put himself a full Earth diameter away from Earth. Even using the center of mass of Earth as its position he should only have been 6,350&nbsp;km away from it, but now he places the measuring point of his distance to Earth on the opposite side of the Earth so his distance to it is equal to its diameter (which would make a choosing a distance of 0&nbsp;km just as correct). Earth is just left of the 10,000&nbsp;km line on both axis, and Earth has a diameter of 12,700&nbsp;km, which will fit fine with the center of the dot, but not with the distance which should have been the maximum distance Randall could be from it (0 or 6350&nbsp;km depending on the definition of distance from Randall).\n\nThe {{w|IAU definition of planet}} requires a solar orbit, gravitational rounding, and \"clearing the neighborhood\", a controversial (at the time of its introduction) calculation of relative size that excludes {{w|Kuiper Belt Objects}} such as Pluto. The calculation regarding Planet Nine would make it large enough to meet the IAU definition. Using this definition the chart quickly rules out birds and bugs, although at a glance they could be mistaken for planets, something that is especially the case for planes (at night) which are even called ''fool’s planets’'' in the chart, a reference to {{w|fool's Gold}}. Note that anything that is actually on Earth is positioned within 60&nbsp;km from Randall. This is because if it is further away he cannot see them due to the curvature of the Earth. This does not mean that he intends to indicate that they cannot be further away from him than that.\n\nThe already known planets are prominently marked on the chart. They are the solid black dots. Besides Earth and ''Planet Nine?'', the bottom row of three small dots are {{w|Mercury (planet)|Mercury}}, {{w|Venus}} and {{w|Mars}}. The top row of four larger dots (but smaller than the dot that marks Earth) are (from left to right) {{w|Jupiter}} and {{w|Saturn}} (visible to the naked eye) and {{w|Uranus}} and Neptune (visible through a telescope).\n\nIt is unclear how Randall is calculating these distances, especially to the three {{w|terrestrial planets}}, since neither of these options work: closest approach, average, mean, current or maximum distance. In the comic [[482: Height]] Randall shows (among other) the distance from the Earths surface to all the planets. For especially Venus and Mars he shows that their distance changes a lot based on theirs and Earth's orbital positions. But he has neither used these loops to base the dot size or position, as these loops clearly go closer than 1 AU and only one of the planets are drawn closer than that. It is thus unclear which of the three represents which planet, but in the '''[[#Table of items in the chart|table below]]''' it has been reasoned that the dot situated at the largest diameter of the three inner planets planets should represent Venus (12,000&nbsp;km) as it is almost twice as big as Mars (6,700&nbsp;km), which on the other hand is more similar to Mercury (5,000&nbsp;km) and given that the two dots furthest out are almost the same size, it would make most sense if they represent Mercury and Mars. Since the outer dot never comes closer than 2.5 AU and Mercury never gets further away than 1.5 AU it makes most sense to place Mercury as the middle of the three and Mars as the outer of the three dots.\n\nBelow some objects are mentioned that are not on the chart, and also other errors in position (probably due the hasty creation of such a complex comic.) Many of these objects as well as the planets with the errors mentioned clearly revealed can be see in this '''[http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/ef/Modified_possible_undiscovered_planets.png modified image]''', which is also inserted and explained [[#Image used to create data for the table|in the trivia section]] below.\n\nPluto, no longer considered a planet (it was the ninth until 2006), is not marked on the chart, but it would be below Neptune just outside the pink region (2,300&nbsp;km diameter and 30-50 AU away). This makes sense since that region is for dwarf planets not yet discovered and any one as big and close as Pluto would have been discovered by now. There are thus also other dwarf planets that would not belong in the pink region, one of them is even much much closer and is easily visible with a telescope: {{w|Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres}}, which would appear roughly below Mars and Jupiter. (950&nbsp;km diameter and 1.5-4 AU away from Earth). But this pink region is there to show where there could (and most likely will) still be undiscovered dwarf planets.\n\nThe {{w|Moon}} is also marked on the chart, with a gray dot (almost as large as the gas giants dots). The name is written in brackets since it's not a planet (because Earth is clogging up its neighborhood). Randall has messed up the positioning and the diameter of the Moon as it is clearly positioned past a million km, and it is only up to 400,000&nbsp;km away from the Earth.\n\nThe Sun is not marked at all, even though it is extremely prominent, but as it is clearly not a planet it is left out. It would per definition have been at a distance of 1 AU, and with a diameter of 1.4x10<sup>6</sup> km it would be well inside the region of things that we can see during the day. Note that objects this big will always be shining, already a large planet such as Jupiter is [https://www.worldcat.org/title/jupiter-and-saturn/oclc/60393951&referer=brief_results brighter] than if it could reflect 100% of Sun's light. In general, ''planets ruled out because we would see them during the day'' refers to objects big enough to be {{w|stars}} or {{w|brown dwarfs}}, but {{w|List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs|the only star system}}, other than Sun, that would fit on the chart is {{w|Alpha Centauri}}, which at 4.37 {{w|light-years}} (ly) is well within the right boundary that falls at 5.68 ly, just before the distance to the next nearest star {{w|Barnard's Star}} at 5.96 ly from the Sun. A light year is 63,241 AU, and with the 10,000 AU mark far from the right edge of this log-log plot, it is clear that also 100,000 AU and thus a light year is within the chart. And this also goes for 5 ly.\n\n\"Planets ruled out by the WISE survey\" refers to the {{w|Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}} (WISE), a space telescope designed to look for warm objects such as brown dwarfs, which generate heat at their centers. It was capable of detecting Saturn-sized or larger planets in the outer reaches of our solar system, but did not find any. WISE would not have detected \"Planet Nine\" (even if it exists) because it is too small and thus too cold to be detected. There is a chance that it can be seen in some more temperature sensitive measurements. But these have not been checked for such a planet yet, (see [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/feature-astronomers-say-neptune-sized-planet-lurks-unseen-solar-system here]).\n\nThe word ''satellites'' is written on the border of two regions indicating that these can be in both regions. Some are small enough (10&nbsp;cm) to be comparable to the ''space junk'' below, (see {{w|cubesats}}), others are much bigger and would fit in the region above: ''Stuff we can see through telescopes''. Although it may not be called a satellite in daily talk, the {{w|International Space Station}} is in fact a satellite, which is over 100 m in the longest direction. It would thus be on the border to the ''Planets ruled out because I would have noticed them above my house'' region just above the \"A\" in ''satellites'' (400&nbsp;km above the surface). Some satellites can be seen without a telescope, like the space station.\n\nThe title text explains why some people {{w|It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman|confuse Superman for a bird or a plane}}, since {{w|Superman}} often flies at the limit between the two categories in the diagram. This is though not really true as can be seen in the bottom of the table below. (This was later referenced in [[Bird/Plane/Superman]].)\n\n===Table of items in the chart===\n*This table lists the limits of all regions and dots in the image.\n**Some of the more stretched out regions has also been split into two or three smaller parts.\n**The planet dots has the limits from the edges of the circle the dots makes used for maximum and minimum limits.\n*The table is sort-able, taking care of units even though these change throughout.\n*The data has been read out using the [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/ef/Modified_possible_undiscovered_planets.png image] inserted and explained [[#Image used to create data for the table|in the trivia section]].\n**The image also shows the \"correct position\" of the planets and the Moon, and includes other objects discussed in the table and the explanation\n**Note that superman is also drawn in on this image.\n*The wiki links included below may have been used in the explanation above.\n**They are only used once in this table though, but not necessarily the first time the word is used.\n**Rather they are used in the section that has most to do with this object\n***So Earth is first wiki-linked from the Earth dot\n***And brown dwarfs first from the WISE region etc.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Earth comes close since Randall is on its surface (most of the time). The line dividing this region from the'' Planets we see at night'' hits the Y-axis at 1&nbsp;cm and then goes to the top at almost 10 AU. A dot representing Earth is on this line at around 12,700&nbsp;km = Earth's diameter. This is strange since this means that Randall is 12,700&nbsp;km from Earth. Of course this is how far he is from the far side of the Earth, but more logically it would either have been 6,350&nbsp;km (from Earths center) or 1&nbsp;cm, since his surface, that is his feet, touches Earth, except for the soles of his shoes.\n|-\n|Planets ruled out because they wouldn’t fit through my door||{{sort|0140|1 m}}||{{sort|012|60 m}}||{{sort|02300|1 m}}||{{sort|0190|60 m}}||As these \"planets\" are more than 1 m in diameter it is likely they would not fit through his door. It is assumed that if a planet were within 60 m from Randall that they would be within his house, but because objects in this triangle can't fit through his door,even though they should be in his house, they couldn't be in his house, and thus they can be ruled out (they do not exist). The real planets would of course also not fit through any door.\n|-\n|{{w|Birds}} that got into my house||{{sort|013|20 cm}}||{{sort|011|60 m}}||{{sort|0190|20 cm}}||{{sort|0140|1 m}}||Small birds that get into Randall's house.

A small part of this section just reaches into the Dwarf planet territory, making sense as {{w|Ceres}} is a dwarf planet in the {{w|asteroid belt}} which lies in this distance range. However, Ceres is much closer to Earth than the dwarf planet region. But that region is also the one where undiscovered dwarf planets should be! The main concentration of asteroids in the belt is between Mars and Jupiter. A very slim region in this log-log chart! Ceres is the only dwarf planet in the belt. The largest asteroid is {{w|4 Vesta|Vesta}} which is not gravitational rounded even with a diameter of 500&nbsp;km. It would not fit inside this part of the chart due to its size (and distance of 2.4 AU). The best known comet is {{w|Halley's Comet}} which returns every 75 year (next time in 2061). At that time it is much closer to the Sun than Earth at just 0.6 AU, but in 7 years time when it is the farthest away it will be out at 35 AU, further out than Neptune. But is it only of the order of 10&nbsp;km in diameter (11&nbsp;km in mean, 8&nbsp;km x 15&nbsp;km). So it can only be seen when close to the sun for a few months. This comet would fit inside this region for most of the time, when it is more than 2 AU from the sun, above the word \"and\" near the top of this part of the region over that word.\n|-\n|{{w|Oort cloud}}||{{sort|045000000|1000 AU}}||{{sort|04000000|1 ly}}||{{sort|015|0.15 mm}}||{{sort|02500|500 km}}||For distance this is only the region where the words ''Oort cloud'' are written in this large region.

The Oort cloud is speculated to stretch as far as 2 ly out from the Sun.

But the limits here are interesting to compare with the entire region or with that of the part with smaller dimensions as shown above. The reason the upper limit cut of at the same level through all this region it that if the \"planets\" got any bigger, then they would turn into brown dwarfs that could be seen during the day, or if they got bigger they could even turn into a small star (or big star see below), and thus would be visible by day.\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:pink;\"| Dwarf planets||{{sort|03900000|13 AU}}||{{sort|04300000|5.7 ly}}||{{sort|031000|170 km}}||{{sort|02700|16,000 km}}||Dwarf planets can in principle be anywhere in the solar system.

They have to have a certain size to be a planet if they are this far away, and also have to be this far away before it is realistic they would not already have been discovered. If they were any bigger, it would be like with the other planet regions to the left, that they would turn into a brown dwarf, (or at least Saturn sized planet) and although maybe not visible with telescopes just above this size, they would have been spotted by the WISE survey (see below).

It was capable of detecting Saturn-sized or larger planets in the outer reaches of our solar system, but did not find any. WISE would not have detected \"Planet Nine\" (even if it exists) because it is too small and thus too cold to be detected. If the objects got any bigger than the upper limit they would turn into small stars, which would be visible during the night probably even with the naked eye.

The upper limit is at the top of the chart which almost reaches 10 AU. The {{w|Sun}} fits into this region (at 1 AU per definition and at 1.4x10<sup>6</sup> km), but is not depicted. It still fits in even when it turns into a {{w|red giant}}, after its main sequence when it has {{w|Sun#After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion|exhausted its hydrogen}}, then it will swell up to a diameter of 2 AU and not only swallow the two inner most planets but also likely reach out to Earth. But there are also stars swelling up to more than 10 AU ({{w|UY Scuti}} is {{w|List of largest stars|the largest}} known star, it has a diameter of almost 16 AU). The max. distance actually reaches the nearest star system of {{w|Alpha Centauri}}. And the biggest of those stars would be inside this last region, as it is 1.2 times bigger than the sun, and thus have a diameter of approximately 1.7 10<sup>6</sup> km, and they are \"only\" about 4,37 {{w|light-years}} (ly) away and the graph goes to 5.7 ly. But these stars are definitely not visible during the day. If the graph had stopped at 10,000 AU, at the last tick, this may have been true, but now it is an error, as stars in this entire region will not be visible during day time. But they would at night, if not by eye then by telescope. So no planets in this region, and also no undiscovered objects of that size!\n|-\n|Gray Dot: ({{w|Moon}})||{{sort|0310000|1.3x10<sup>6</sup> km}}||{{sort|02400|3x10<sup>6</sup> km}}||{{sort|033000|5,000 km}}||{{sort|02600|12,000 km}}||This dot represents the Moon. It is gray and moon is written in brackets to indicate that it is not a planet. Randall seems to have misplaced the dot completely. The Moon has a diameter of 3,400&nbsp;km and the min limit is 5,000&nbsp;km. It is even worse with the distance which is a factor 10 too large, at least at the max. The moon is on average 380,000&nbsp;km from earth, and at the max distance is 406,700&nbsp;km, to which Randall can add 6000&nbsp;km when on the other side of the Earth to get him about 413,000&nbsp;km from the Moon (but then he cannot see it). However, the minimum distance given is more than one million km, and thus more than a factor two of, and the max distance is almost a factor 10 off. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes.\n|-\n|Dot 1: {{w|Earth}}||{{sort|027000|12,000 km}}||{{sort|0190|32,000 km}}||{{sort|034000|12,000 km}}||{{sort|02900|23,000 km}}||This dot represents Earth. The Earth has a diameter of 12,700&nbsp;km and Randall is on top of it, thus distance is zero. Thus the dot makes no sense. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes.\n|-\n|Dot 2: {{w|Venus}}||{{sort|03300000|0.8 AU}}||{{sort|025000|1.2 AU}}||{{sort|038000|15,000 km}}||{{sort|03200|30,000 km}}||This dot either represents Mercury or Venus, as they are the one closest to 1 AU from Earth. Mercury comes closest to this limit as it never gets far from the sun and thus also never strays far from being 1 AU from the Earth. The range of distances from Earth is from 0.5 to 1.5 AU, with Venus coming close to this with a range from 0.25 to 1.7 AU. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes. And for the distance this is within the limits for both Venus and Mercury's orbit. However, the diameter of Mercury is only 5,000&nbsp;km and this does not fit well, so from that principle it fits better with Venus. But Venus can be much longer from the Earth when on the other side of the sun, and with a diameter of 12,000&nbsp;km it doesn't even fit well with Venus. However, since Mars, the third planet is much closer in diameter to Mercury than Venus with 6,700&nbsp;km, and two of the dots are of equal and smaller size, it makes most sense that this planet is Venus.\n|-\n|Dot 3: {{w|Mercury (planet)|Mercury}}||{{sort|03400000|1.2 AU}}||{{sort|026000|2.3 AU}}||{{sort|037000|12,000 km}}||{{sort|03100|25,000 km}}||This dot either represents Mercury or Venus, as they are the one closest to Earth. Venus can get closer to the Earth when they are on the same side of the sun. The range of distances from Earth is from 0.25 to 1.7 AU. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes. The distance for this dot fits equally bad with both planets. The diameter is smaller than before, but it is still way too big for Mercury’s 5,000&nbsp;km and it is not too small but just at the limit of the 12,000&nbsp;km of Venus. This does thus fit better with Venus on both parameters. But Mercury is similar in size to Mars, the third dot, and the second and third dot are at the same diameter, which makes it more likely that the larger diameter for dot 2, should belong to Venus, making this dot Mercury.\n|-\n|Dot 4: {{w|Mars}}||{{sort|03500000|2.5 AU}}||{{sort|027000|4.7 AU}}||{{sort|036000|12,000 km}}||{{sort|03000|23,000 km}}||This dot represents Mars. Mars has a diameter of 6,700&nbsp;km and, so here it is set to at least double its diameter. The max and min given here is at the limit of the circle the dot makes. The range of distances from Earth is from 0.4 to 2.7 AU. The min distance at least is lower than 2.7 AU thus making this the dot that fits best with Mars. Because putting Mercury at a dot well past 2 AU would simply not make any sense, even though Mars can actually get closer to Earth than Mercury.\n|-\n|Dot 5: {{w|Jupiter}}||{{sort|03600000|2.6 AU}}||{{sort|029000|6.7 AU}}||{{sort|0440000|100,000 km}}||{{sort|037000|240,000 km}}||This dot represents Jupiter. Jupiter has a diameter of 140,000&nbsp;km so it falls within the range. The distances from the sun is about 5 AU and thus from the Earth it ranges from about 4 to 6 AU.

As it is only speculations made on well documented features of dwarf planets' orbits, nothing much is known. But the guess is that it has a diameter between 26,000 and 52,000&nbsp;km (fine with the dots min and max) and although it could get into 200 AU this may take thousands of years, and it is expected that it will be further out than 700 AU most of the time going all the way out to 1200 AU, so this dot fits perfectly with the newest estimates.\n|-\n|{{w|Superman}} (title text)||{{sort|0150|1 m}}||{{sort|0140|10 km}}||{{sort|0210|50 cm}}||{{sort|0150|2 m}}||The limits are set as Arms length away (shaking hands with Randall), and he cannot be seen much more than 10&nbsp;km away (like for big birds).

The region, of undiscovered dwarf planets, is shaded pink, also to indicate that here may be more of these, but the lighter color indicate that these will not be new “planets”. The eight known planets are marked with a black dot, and also this is explained with a dot under the colored rectangle. The Moon is indicated with a similar dot, but in gray, and the name is in brackets. The chart itself is divided into several labeled regions, the smallest with the label outside and an arrow pointing in.

But if it where we should have detected it by now.\n*There are several planets/objects that are very far from the mark.\n**The moon is far off on both parameters.\n**All three terrestrial planets are way off.\n***Except of course if the 2nd planet is Venus, then the deviation for that one would not be too bad.\n***But it would not make sense to make Mercury bigger than Venus and it thus just seems that all three are far off the mark\n**Jupiter is spot on, Saturn not far away and Uranus close enough. \n***But Neptune is so close to Uranus on both parameters on the log-log plot, that this probably explains why it has been placed quite of the mark distance wise.\n*Extra additions:\n**Pluto has been included and it is not within the pink Dwarf planet region. \n***This makes sense as it has been discovered, and any object this large and that close would have been discovered by now. \n***Thus again indicating that this region is the region of Possible Undiscovered '''Dwarf''' Planets.\n**Ceres and Vesta have been included and they are not within the asteroids region\n***As they can be seen in telescopes and are the two largest objects in the belt this makes sense.\n***Their distance range is indicated with bars and ranges this wide since their distance from Earth depend drastically on which side of the sun they are.\n**Halley's Comet has been added and here a large bar is needed to indicate the distance. \n***The distance from the sun has been used, as it can get very close to the Earth when passing it on the way in.\n**The International Space Station has been included\n***The distance range is given as the height above Earths surface which the line just covers (i.e. not distance from Randall when it is on the other side of the Earth.)\n***The diameter is ranging from the height of 20 m to the width of 108 m (length 73 m).\n**The Sun has been inserted\n***Also when it becomes a red giant\n***This is a case where an actual real object would put Randall inside them. As can be seen the Sun as a red giant would be in the ''Planets ruled out because I would be inside them'', as it in the end will reach a diameter of about 2 AU, it will thus reach out to Earth (as the radius is 1AU).\n***Again the way this zone is depicted using diameter rather than radius makes no sense, since the 2 AU diameter sun would only just reach out to Earth, and not out to Mars. It would make more sense to locate the red star on the boarder of this zone, which would have been the case if Randall had used radius rather than diameter.\n**The nearest star, Alpha Centauri A, has also been included.\n***Thus only the largest of the three stars in that star system is shown. \n**The other two stars are smaller than the sun, and the same distance away when compared to the total distance.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Telescopes]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
