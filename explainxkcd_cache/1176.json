[scoot scoot]\n}}\n\n\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] (likely representing [[Randall]]), is sitting listening to a conversation with three other people. As the talk progresses, each member contributes gossip about a different group absent from the table, and talking mostly negatively about their qualities and goals. As Cueball notices this, he has decided to leave conversations deemed toxic, by scooting his chair a little bit more farther from the table any time somebody badmouths someone not present. In each panel, he scoots progressively further away, with the previous conversation diminishing as he moves, until he reaches another conversation with [[Megan]], [[Hairy]], and [[Beret Guy]], discussing a blurry video about {{w|giant squids}}. He asks to join them, as this conversation seems far more interesting to him than one criticizing people behind their backs.\n\nThe title text jokes that the second group, is, unfortunately, also criticising the giant squid. As the squid is not present, Cueball starts to scoot his chair even more, to hopefully find a non-toxic conversation somewhere else. It is unclear if he is moving to back to where he came from (as possibly the first group seem to be less toxic than the second), or even further onwards (to seek out a new and more palatable conversation).\n\n==Transcript==\n:Every time someone says something negative about a person who's not in the room, I scoot my chair back a few inches.\n:[Cueball, Ponytail and two other people are sitting at a table drinking.]\n:Person: ''He's'' not so bad, but his ''friends''...\n:[Cueball scoots away from table.]\n:''Scoot scoot''\n\n:Ponytail: His band is never gonna take off if...\n:[Cueball scoots further away.]\n:''Scoot scoot''\n\n:[Megan, Beret Guy, and Hairy come into view.]\n:Off-screen: Yeah, his sister is even ''weirder''.\n:Off-screen: Did you see she had...\n:''Scoot scoot''\n:Beret Guy: ...and there's a video, but it's blurry...\n\n:[Cueball turns around and leans his arm on his chair.]\n:Cueball: What're you talking about?\n:Hairy: Giant squid!\n:Cueball: Mind if I join you?\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/b/b7/20151214165657%21those_not_present.png original version of the comic], in the first panel, the word \"fr'''i'''ends\" was originally misspelled as \"frends\". This was later fixed.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
