Go go gadget cup.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe person in the comic is Inspector Gadget from the {{w|Inspector Gadget|animated series of the same name}}. Gadget was a cyborg detective that had access to a wide variety of gadgets which he would activate with the words \"Go go gadget [insert item here].\" The gadgets would usually spawn from his hat, such as his trademark personal helicopter (\"go go gadget copter!\"). One of the running gags of the series was that Gadget was completely clueless during his missions, and unbeknownst to him, relied heavily on the assistance of his niece Penny, her computer book, and her dog, Brain.\n\nIn this strip, Inspector Gadget (wearing his trademark hat and trench coat) looks around furtively and apparently moves away from the listener (or the camera pans out to reveal the empty environment) before saying the words \"Go go gadget two lesbians doing it.\"  In fiction, the fantasy of lesbians having sex is supposedly a common turn-on for straight men, although this has yet to be confirmed in real life. The command, given in the last panel of the comic, also serves to identify the person speaking. Identification along with the punchline is a common comedy trope.\n\nIn the title text, Gadget requests further gadgets: A video camera, to record the action, and a cup. The cup is probably a reference to the well-known, scatological pornographic video ''{{w|2 Girls, 1 Cup}}'', which was prominent at the time the comic was created.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Inspector Gadget in a trench coat and hat stands mid-frame.]\n\n:[Gadget turns his head, looking to his right.]\n\n:[Gadget stands alone in a wide expanse.]\n\n:[Gadget finally speaks.]\n:Gadget: Go go gadget two lesbians doing it.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Homosexuality]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
