In the former, Romeo, attempting to woo Juliet, stands beneath her balcony to profess his love for her. In the latter, an inarticulate cadet, Christian, professes his love for Roxane by arranging to use the words of a fellow soldier, Cyrano, who secretly also loves Roxane. The 1989 movie \"{{w|Say Anything...}}\" contains a modern interpretation of this declaration of love, where {{w|John Cusack}} plays {{w|Peter Gabriel|Peter Gabriel's}} \"{{w|In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel song)#Say Anything...|In Your Eyes}}\" on a boombox outside the house of the girl he likes.\n\nParodying this iconic scene ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Y8tFQ01OY video]), Cueball is holding up a {{w|boombox}} (a self-contained semiportable stereo system, typically with cassette tape or CD player, and complete with integrated speakers) that is playing music while Cueball declares his love for Megan. She first is startled, embarrassed, then eventually confused by the 1990 hit single {{w|Ice Ice Baby}} ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE&ob=av2e video]) by {{w|Vanilla Ice}} playing on the boombox. Cueball then admits he is \"not very good at this,\" attempting to recreate the classic romantic scene, but utterly failing to play music suitable for such an event. The film scene is also referenced and parodied in the {{w|South Park}} episode 'Raisins', when Stan unsuccessfully tries to win back his ex-girlfriend Wendy in this fashion. Stan is advised to play Peter Gabriel out of a boombox, but plays the decidedly unromantic Peter Gabriel track {{w|Shock The Monkey}}. It is possible that Randall was also referencing that South Park scene in this comic.\n\nThe title text mentions that Cueball is actually playing \"{{w|Under Pressure}}\" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I video]), the 1981 hit song by {{w|Queen (band)|Queen}} and {{w|David Bowie}}, but Megan has confused it with \"Ice Ice Baby,\" which samples the bassline and piano motif from \"Under Pressure.\" It also may be that Cueball is having trouble holding the boombox, hence Cueball being 'under pressure.'\n\nThese two songs are again referenced together in [[1561: Water Phase Diagram]], and \"Ice Ice Baby\" is also lampooned in [[210: 90's Flowchart]]. It is possible that this is the same couple as mentioned in [[112: Baring My Heart]], as the creator of that Venn diagram reveals to their romantic partner that their feelings towards their paramour are comparable to their feelings for Vanilla Ice.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is looking out a second story window at Cueball holding a boombox over his head. Musical Notes are coming out of it.]\n:Cueball: Megan!\n:Megan: Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening.\n:Cueball: I love you!\n:Megan: Okay, that's great. Wait a second. Is... is that... Ice Ice Baby? What the hell?\n:Cueball: I'm not very good at this.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis was the first time that the name \"[[Megan#Name|Megan]]\" was used on [[xkcd]]. The next comic to use it was the more depressing [[215: Letting Go]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
