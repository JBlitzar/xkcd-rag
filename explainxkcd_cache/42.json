The previous one was [[35: Sheep]], and the next one was [[38: Apple Jacks]].\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic references a long-running ad campaign for {{w|Geico}} insurance in which a character (different in each commercial) lists a series of horrible events or news, but then caps it off with \"but I've got good news: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico\" â€“ news that may be good, but is usually either trivial compared to the magnitude of the preceding bad news, or else is said to the person whom all of the preceding bad news applied to, giving them false hope that the good news was for them. It became a recognizable pop culture phrase. In this one-panel comic, [[Cueball]] parodies the punchline by saving money on his car insurance by intimidation, instead of choosing the best provider. A golf club would later also be used for similarly socially unacceptable actions in [[81: Attention, shopper]], and Geico's ad would be mentioned again in [[870: Advertising]].\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] attributes this comic to the unknown friend [[David]]. He does the same in [[51: Malaria]] and [[100: Family Circus]]. We can assume (or rather, we can ''hope'') that \"this\" refers to the act of writing the comic, as opposed to the act of threatening his insurance agent.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball holding a golf club.]\n:Cueball: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by threatening my agent with a golf club.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring [[David]].\n\n{{comic discussion}} \n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 38]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring David]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:Emoji]]"
