The argument is sometimes presented as \"Imagine if you ate each of those ingredients separately\". In this case, a pizza is broken down into its core ingredients, shown in their actual quantities: A large block of cheese, a loaf of bread, a glass of tomato sauce, and a pile of salt. [[Cueball]] (on the right) proposes to eat each of these ingredients individually and in their entirety—an act that many people (such as his Cueball-like friend to the left) may consider absurd or repulsive. This proposal is meant to change the reader's opinion of the final product—instead of enjoying a pizza, the reader may instead be reminded of the concept of eating a block of cheese and a pile of salt separately, and choose to eat something else instead.\n\nThis argument is effectively a counter to the practice of cooking, which combines individual ingredients into a more palatable product. Just as [[1609: Food Combinations]] points out that combining two foods can make them sound less disgusting, this comic shows how separating out a meal can have the opposite effect.\n\nThe title text refers to a vegetable pizza, which is generally perceived as healthier than a standard pizza. Randall points out here that although vegetables may add some nutrients to the meal, they don't magically reduce the other ingredients or their impacts. Additionally, the vegetables on a pizza may have been cooked in oil (or grease), or have absorbed the grease from the cheese as it melted, further impacting their potential benefits.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball to the right and his Cueball-like friend to the left sits behind a table. Visible on the table between them are a loaf of bread, a glass with some liquid in it, an oblong box with a readable label and a small heap of small grains.]\n:Friend: What're you having for lunch?\n:Cueball: The usual—half a pound of cheese, white bread, a glass of tomato sauce, and some salt.\n:Friend: Eww.\n:Label on the box: Cheese\n\n:[Caption below the panel.]\n:Pizza seems way grosser if you imagine eating just the ingredients.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
