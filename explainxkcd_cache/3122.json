It follows [[2999: Bad Map Projection: The United Stralia]], released nine and a half months prior.\n\nThere is no perfect way to draw a map of the world on a flat piece of paper. Each one will introduce a different type of distortion, and the best projection for a given situation depends on what the map is used for. As was mentioned in [[977: Map Projections]], a wisecrack to this dilemma is to use a globe - which maps the world onto a ''sphere'', thus minimizing distortion by using {{w|Geoid|roughly}} the same shape as the world itself. This \"map projection\" goes a step past the wisecrack and proceeds straight into absurdity, by projecting ''each continent'' onto a sphere. This bends entirely too far in the other direction to the dilemma; whereas a typical map projection adds distortion by trying to show the (curved) planet on a flat surface, this \"map projection\" adds distortion by showing the (relatively flat) continents on a much more sharply-curved sphere than the planet they are actually part of.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|land bridges}}, narrow bits of land between larger landmasses. When glaciers covered much of the Earth, the water locked up in the glaciers meant that sea levels were lower, as well as the overlying icepacks being higher, and things like the {{w|Bering land bridge}} spanned areas between continents that are currently ocean. [[Randall]] suggests that these formed connections in the gaps between the spheres. This implies the absurd idea that the projection reflects an underlying reality where the continents ''actually'' exist on separate spheres, rather than this simply being an attempt at a \"better\" way to display Earth's landmasses. In this situation the land of the 'bridges' would reach like spires, vertically upwards from the surface of each sphere, until they descend down onto their counterpart neighbouring sphere.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[This comic depicts seven circles each representing globes. Above these circles there is the following text:]\n:Bad map projection #194:\n:'''<big>Interrupted spheres</big>'''\n:To avoid the distortion inherent to a single flat world map, each continent is projected onto its own globe. \n\n:[Each of the seven globes has one continent of Earth projected on to it, with a label of said areas name. The globes are arranged in position so their landmasses lies roughly where they would be on a standard map with North America in the upper left and Australia in the lower right part of the picture. The labels on the seven spheres in the three columns they form from left to right are:]\n:North America\n:South America\n:Europe\n:Africa\n:Asia\n:Antarctica\n:Australia\n\n==Trivia==\nIn this comic [[Randall]] indicates that he believes there are seven continents. This is {{w|Continent#Number|up for debate}}, especially with Europe being considered part of the larger Eurasian continent, rather than distinct from Asia, and whether the Americas are two continents or one, temporarily joined via the Caribbean oceanic plate. See for instance {{w|CGP Grey}}'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uBcq1x7P34 What are Continents?] video for a discussion. (Grey concludes that there are five, in his opinion.)\n\nSeveral borders between countries are missing, those being the borders between Romania and Bulgaria, Bulgaria and Greece, Albania and Greece, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and Sudan, and between Thailand and Malaysia. The border of Kashmir, a disputed territory between Pakistan, India, and China, is done in dashed lines. Although it is implied each continent is projected onto its own globe by itself, a part of the coast of North Africa is visible on the Europe globe.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n\n[[Category:Bad Map Projections]]"
