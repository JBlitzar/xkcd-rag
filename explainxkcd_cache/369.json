(Things like 'car' and 'boating' and such are of course the highest, by a huge margin.)\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is a chart of the frequency of certain phrases in Google search results, based on the format \"died in a ______ accident.\" At the time of this comic, if you enclosed search terms in quotation marks, Google looked up the exact phrase rather than the individual words in any order (this feature still exists today but with major tweaks).\n\nThe chart starts with several activities where the prospect of death is, while uncommon, still fairly understandable &mdash; skydiving involves falling thousands of feet, surfing involves fighting the roiling ocean, and injuries in skateboarding are common. Further down the chart the activities become safer until finally hitting the punchline: knitting and blogging involve sitting safely in a chair for several hours, leaving the reader to puzzle out just what a \"blogging accident\" could possibly be.\n\n\"Died in a blogging accident\" was very rare in Google {{w|Observer effect|until this comic appeared}}. It could be found on over 10,000 webpages approximately 12 hours after the comic was posted. Similarly, both snake charming and haberdashery accidents also return hundreds of Google results.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Dangers\n:Indexed by the number of Google results for\n:\"Died in a _____ Accident\"\n:[A bar chart showing \"Type of Accident\" vs \"Google Results\" each with a bar representing a number]\n:Skydiving: 710\n:Elevator: 575\n:Surfing: 496\n:Skateboarding: 473\n:Camping: 166\n:Gardening: 100\n:Ice Skating: 94\n:Knitting: 7\n:Blogging: 2\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Bar charts]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Google Search]]"
