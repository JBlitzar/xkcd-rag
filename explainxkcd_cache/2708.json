Better close that).\n\nThe title text jokes that unmatched instances of † (the dagger symbol, also used for footnotes) are threats being made by the author to the reader with a physical dagger. As of this writing, it states \"If you ever see the † dagger symbol with no '''''un'''''matched footnote...\", forming a double negative. This is likely a typo intended as \"...no matching footnote.\"\n\n† In some contexts, an unpaired asterisk or dagger may not refer to a footnote, and thus not constitute a mystery. Examples include programming languages and mathematical expressions using asterisks such as for the multiplication operator, and dates of birth and death which are sometimes indicated with an asterisk or dagger respectively.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A blank panel with text at the bottom.]\n:'''*'''Whenever you see a mystery asterisk that doesn't have a matching footnote, it points here.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Footnotes]]"
