Instead, the hardware (in this case, a {{w|Central processing unit|processor}} of the {{w|x86-64}} architecture) is controlled by the {{w|operating system}} {{w|Kernel (computing)|kernel}} (in this specific case, {{w|XNU}} is the kernel used in Apple-branded devices). Many operating systems offer a standardized {{w|Interface (computing)|interface}} called {{w|POSIX}}, which wraps the services offered by the different operating systems so that applications do not need to cope with the differences between the operating systems. {{w|Darwin (operating system)|Darwin}} is the name of the core set of components on which the Apple's {{w|OS X}} operating system runs. And using this operating system, the user runs the {{w|Firefox}} web browser. However, the browser itself contains further abstraction layers: {{w|Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko}} is the engine handling the display of web pages on the screen, but in this case, it only allows a separate software, {{w|Adobe Flash Player}}, to render a video requested by the user.\n\nAnd all of this work is, in this case, done only because the user wanted to watch a funny cat Flash video on the Internet; which makes the user feel like he is a god.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Maru (cat)|Maru the cat}}, a cat who became very popular on YouTube for, among other things, jumping into a box. Cueball questions his god-like capabilities by wondering why can't he own Maru.\n\nFlash was an early way to make fluid media (such as games and animations) online that didn't require transmitting much data in a time where internet speeds averaged about 300KB/s. One of its uses was for video playing in a time where many browsers did not natively support playing media. It is now superseded by {{w|HTML5}} technologies [[2405: Flash Gatsby|and discontinued at the very beginning of 2021]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a computer.]\n:An x64 processor is screaming along at billions of cycles per second to run the XNU kernel, which is frantically working through all the POSIX-specified abstraction to create the Darwin system underlying OS X, which in  turn is straining itself to run Firefox and its Gecko renderer, which creates a Flash object which renders dozens of video frames every second\n\n:because I wanted to see a cat jump into a box and fall over.\n\n:I am a god.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]"
