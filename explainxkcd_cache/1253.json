    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1253\n| date      = August 19, 2013\n| title     = Exoplanet Names\n| image     = exoplanet names.png\n| titletext = If you have any ideas, I hear you can send them to <nowiki>iaupublic@iap.fr</nowiki>.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic would later be updated in [[1555: Exoplanet Names 2]]. On the 14th of August, 2013, the {{w|International Astronomical Union}} (IAU) [https://www.iau.org/science/news/179/ issued a document] about public naming of astronomical objects. It stated, \"IAU fully supports the involvement of the general public, whether directly or through an independent organized vote, in the naming of planetary satellites, newly discovered planets, and their host stars.\"\n\nThe caption above the comic states the fact above and then notes that the IAU immediately regret this decision. As we can see from [[Cueball|Cueball's]] question, from [[Ponytail]]'s facepalm, and the fact that even [[Megan]] is speechless, the suggestions are appalling. It becomes even worse when [[Hairbun]] tells them that an automatic filter has already been applied to the results, one designed to remove inappropriate entries that don't meet certain criteria. This implies that the list would have been even worse if presented in its unfiltered form (as seen below in the table).\n\nThe naming document also contained, amongst other things, guidelines that suggested names should meet. These include stipulations such as \"16 characters or less\", \"preferably one word\", being \"pronounceable (in as many languages as possible)\", \"not too similar to an existing name of an astronomical object\", avoiding commercial names, and being \"respectful of intellectual property\". If we go down the list, we can see that many of [[Randall|Randall's]] suggestions do indeed violate the guidelines. Which is part of the joke as it reflects the tendency of internet submissions to ignore such softly suggested guidelines.\n\nThe randomness and inappropriateness of the suggested names reflects the commonly expected response from anonymous submitters on the internet. Many forums and contests that call for online response and do not apply strict control over the responses receive similar collections of random, inappropriate and obscure submissions that are often only tangentially related to the original subject. For example, Greenpeace held a naming contest for one of the whales recently tagged in their research and preservation campaign and even after selecting the finalists the online voting resulted in naming the whale \"Mr. Splashypants\". PepsiCo had even less restrictive controls in their marketing campaign that asked the internet to name a new flavor of Mountain Dew. They had to shut down the contest in order to avoid naming the new beverage \"Hitler did nothing wrong\" which was the current leader at the time and only marginally the most inappropriate of the top ten voted suggestions. Even more recently is the case of {{w|Boaty McBoatface}}, in which the internet decided to dub a British research vessel \"Boaty McBoatface\". The boat was given the name {{w|RRS Sir David Attenborough}} in the end, with its Autonomous Underwater Vehicle being called \"Boaty McBoatface\".\n\nThe document also states that naming suggestions may be sent to the email that Randall included in the title text.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

A* (pronounced \"A star\") is already used in astronomy, for example the Milky Way's black hole core is {{w|Sagittarius A*}}. \"A star\" is also the name for the character {{w|asterisk}} and the name of the popular {{w|A* search algorithm}} in computer science. It also suggests that the planet is a star.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n| {{w|Gliese 667 Ce|e}}\n| e'); DROP TABLE PLANETS;--\n| A reference to {{w|SQL injection}}, riffing off of [[327: Exploits of a Mom]], which featured a schoolboy named <code>[[Little Bobby Tables|Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--]]</code>.  The idea here is that the IAU would enter the name into their system and promptly lose all of their data pertaining to planets.
