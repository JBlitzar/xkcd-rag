[[Black Hat]] proposes naming it {{w|Pluto}}, both to commemorate the flyby of the {{w|dwarf planet}} of that name by NASA's {{w|New Horizons}} earlier the same month, but also to end the discussion about the status of Pluto, which is subject to debate among both scientists and laypeople over whether-or-not it should be considered a planet. Pluto was considered a planet for a long period of time until, in 2006, the {{w|International Astronomical Union}} (IAU) created a new definition for the word 'planet' designed to exclude Pluto and similar objects, resulting in much debate (The IAU is the organization that takes responsibility for naming celestial bodies like planets, stars, and much more). \n\nIt may appear that, with Black Hat's suggestion, the answer to the question \"is Pluto a planet?\" will therefore always be \"yes\", regardless of the status of the Pluto in our Solar System according to the IAU. However the same [https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau0603/ IAU official definition] that excludes Pluto also states that a 'planet' has to orbit our sun, so according to the IAU, nothing in this comic is a planet (the IAU definition only allows them to be {{w|exoplanets}}, which, like dwarf planets, are not planets). Hence, the debate indeed becomes 'a little more confusing'. This is in line with Black Hat's characterization as a mischief-maker.\n\nThe title text is referring to the planet name entry ''Netherlands VI'' for the star ''EPIC 201912552''. Randall continues his references to the Netherlands taking over the Earth, Mars, and Pluto after Earth's oceans have been transferred to Mars. The joke started in two consecutive ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' articles, {{what if|53|Drain the Oceans}} and {{what if|54|Drain the Oceans: Part II}}, and it was referenced again in {{what if|57|Dropping a Mountain}} and in [[1551: Pluto]] a week before this comic came out. {{w|New Netherland}} was actually a Dutch colony with {{w|New York City}}, formerly known as {{w|New Amsterdam}}, as its capital. In the title text Randall mentions he will continue with this joke driving it so far into the ground (meaning way beyond the point where it stops being funny) that the Dutch will have to build {{w|levee}}s around it to keep the sea out.\n\n===Table===\nThis table explains each entry in the comic table.

Constant Saxophones could also imply that Saxophone music is played constantly, everywhere on the planet. This could get tiresome for the residents of the planet.\n|-\n| {{w|HD 102365}}\n| b\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Little Big Planet\n| This refers to the videogame {{w|LittleBigPlanet}}. Little Big Planet was also mentioned implicitly in [[Size Venn Diagram]].\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | {{w|Gliese 180}}\n| b\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Dune\n| rowspan=2 | Both references to Frank Herbert's {{w|Dune (novel)|Dune}} book series. The planet Arrakis (informally referred to as 'Dune') is the central planet in the mythology, where the mind-enhancing substance 'spice' comes from. Use of spice enables, among others, supercomputing-like mental computation as well as hyperspace navigation. Having two neighbouring planets with names that are historically used to refer to a single planet would sow further confusion in the already extensive catalog of planet names. This is similarly to Betelgeuse/Beetlejuice (see HR 7722) and the two Uranuses (see Kepler-283).\n|-\n| c\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Arrakis\n|-\n| {{w|Fomalhaut}}\n| b\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Swarm of {{w|Bees}}\n| From Wikipedia: Fomalhaut b could be a conglomeration of rubble from a recent collision between comet-to-asteroid-sized bodies and not actually identify a planet.\n|-\n| rowspan=5 | {{w|Kepler-62}}\n| {{w|Kepler-62b|b}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Sporty\n| rowspan=5 | A reference to the {{w|Spice Girls}}. See also the previous comic, [[1554: Spice Girls]], where [[Megan]] was unable to list the members of this pop group. In this case the names are correct, and would give Megan a new and interesting reason to remember them. {{w|Kepler-62f}} is a [https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/images/kepler-62e.html super-Earth-size planet], that may be potentially habitable. {{w|Kepler-62e}} is a possible [https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/images/kepler-62e.html water world].\n|-\n| {{w|Kepler-62c|c}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Baby\n|-\n| {{w|Kepler-62d|d}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Scary\n|-\n| {{w|Kepler-62e|e}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Ginger\n|-\n| {{w|Kepler-62f|f}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Posh\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | {{w|HD 69830}}\n| {{w|HD 69830 b|b}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Planet.xxx\n| {{w|.xxx}} is a controversial top level domain (like to .com and .net) that is intended to distinguish porn sites from other types of website. Planet X is the name for a still undiscovered planet in our solar system, a common theme both in real science and fiction. The search for \"Planet X\" lead, by chance, to the discovery of Pluto.\n|-\n| {{w|HD 69830 c|c}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Novella\n| A {{w|novella}} is a form of prose with length between a {{w|short story}} and a {{w|novel}}. Common examples of novellas are romance literature centering around intense lustful encounters in cheap paperback books, though also 'serious' literature may be in novella form.\n|-\n| {{w|HD 69830 d|d}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Sexoplanet\n| Like the other two planets orbiting this star, the \"69\" in the stars designation has lead to a sex joke: All planets in this comic are \"exo-planets\", planets not orbiting our sun. Adding a single \"s\" in front results in immature humor. \n|-\n| rowspan=2 | {{w|Gliese 682}}\n| {{w|Gliese 682 b|b}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Verdant Hellscape\n| A contradictory name. \"[[wikt:verdant|Verdant]]\" usually signifies to be lush with green plant life, while \"[[wikt:hellscape|hellscape]]\" describes a desolate landscape destroyed by heat and cataclysm.\n|-\n| {{w|Gliese 682 c|c}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| Unsubscribe\n| On YouTube, \"subscribers\" (people who get updates on a person's channel) are highly valued, and to \"unsubscribe\" from anyone is deemed to be offensive. \"Unsubscribe\" is also the command one sends to {{w|Electronic mailing list}}s to stop receiving said mailing list. In this sense it may imply a desire to no longer be bothered with these silly discussions around planet-names. Like \"help@gmail.com\" and \"How do I join the IAU\", \"unsubscribe\" is a frequently seen accidental message on the Internet in contexts where it is not going to work as a command.\n|-\n| {{w|Kepler-452}}\n| {{w|Kepler-452b|b}}\n| {{Yes|New}}\n| {{w|Pluto}}\n| This is the planet Black Hat is referring to at the top of the table.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|We don't use tables for accessibily, please convert this into a normal transcript!}}\n\n:[Black Hat points with a stick at a slide showing an image of a planet with unknown features marked by questions marks.]\n:Kepler-452b\n\n:Black Hat: NASA has announced the discovery of a (super-)Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star.\n:Black Hat: I suggest we name this planet \"Pluto\", both to celebrate the great work by the ''New Horizons'' team, and to make the stupid \"Is Pluto a planet\" debate a little more confusing\n\n:While we wait to hear from the IAU,\n:here's a revised and updated list of\n:planet name suggestions (see xkcd.com/1253)\n:<font color=\"red\">New or updated entries in red</font>\n\n:[The table is in three separate columns.
