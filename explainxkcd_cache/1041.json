His men were running low on bullets, so Prescott commanded that they hold their fire until the enemy was close enough to guarantee a hit. This was a tactic used by a number of armies, such as Napoleon's French at Aspern and Wellington's British in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nIn this comic, Prescott carries on after his initial command, adding increasingly intimate and sexual references to the enemies' bodies, nearly getting himself shot due to distracting himself. Also, each of his remarks reference a different sense out of the five senses, missing only hearing (which arguably is also satisfied when they actually hear the shots).\n\nThe title text expands on that, stating not to fire until you see the person's \"soul\" in their eyes.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Revolutionary War soldier gives orders to two others hunkered down behind a rock.]\n:Lead soldier: Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes\n\n:Lead: And smell the scent of their hair.\n\n:[The two others getting an incredulous look on their faces. They glance at each other.]\n:Lead: And taste the sweetness of their lips.\n\n:[They begin taking fire from the opposition.]\n:Lead: And feel the heat of their skin pressed against yours, trembling as you-\n:Soldier 2: Maybe we should just start shooting.\n:Lead: Right, yes.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Romance]]"
