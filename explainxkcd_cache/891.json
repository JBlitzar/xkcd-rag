In a way, this chart likens the age of the movie to the age of the person, as the person in each case was about 9-12 years old when the movie came out, but as movies have shorter \"life cycles\" and seem to lose glory quickly, it seems that the movie is very old. However, the age at which a movie is accepted to be old is not nearly as large as the age at which a person is accepted to be old, so the person is not actually that old. This makes it seem that the person is far older than they actually are.\n\nAnd since this chart is designed to make someone feel old, anyone over 35 gets lumped in with \"older people,\" which no one likes.\n\nThe title text states that if you are 15 or younger it is probably already  too late to be a {{w|child prodigy}}. This may be a reference to [[447: Too Old For This Shit]], in which Randall believes that anyone over the age of 11 has already missed out on their chance to become famous.\n\n[[Randall]] has covered making people feel old several times in [[647: Scary]], [[973: MTV Generation]], [[1393: Timeghost]] and [[1477: Star Wars]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:The 2011 Guide to Making People Feel Old\n:-Using Movie Release Dates-\n:[A chart with 2 columns. First column is labeled 'Their Age,' and is numbered 16 through 35 & 'over 35.' The second column is labeled 'You Say' and is divided into four sub-columns. The first sub-column reads '\"Did you realize that...' from 16-35, and the third sub-column says 'Came Out' from 16-35.]\n:Age 16: Snakes on a Plane... Half a decade ago?\"\n:17-19: Revenge of the Sith... More than half a decade ago?\"\n:20: Finding Nemo... Eight years ago?\"\n:21-22: Shrek... Ten years ago?\"\n:23-25: The Matrix...

Eighteen years ago?\"\n:29: Terminator 2... Twenty years ago?\"\n:30-32: Home Alone... More than twenty years ago?\"\n:33-35: The Little Mermaid ... Closer to the moon landing than the present day?\n:Over 35: \"Hey, did you see this chart? You match your age to movie - oh, right, sorry, it only goes up to 35.
