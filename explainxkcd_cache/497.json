He has a very dedicated and vocal base of supporters who believe that he is [[1083|the only true alternative]] to either side of [[661|the Two-Party System]]. These supporters go under the name \"{{w|Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008#Ron Paul Revolution|Ron Paul Revolution}}\" with the letters \"evol\" reversed to emphasise \"love.\"\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. It may be a continuation of the comic [[493: Actuarial]], in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was nominated as Internet secretary. These are all the comics in [[:Category:Secretary|Secretary series]]:\n* [[494: Secretary: Part 1]]\n* [[495: Secretary: Part 2]]\n* [[496: Secretary: Part 3]]\n* [[497: Secretary: Part 4]]\n* [[498: Secretary: Part 5]]\n\n{{w|Tron (film)|Tron}} is a movie made by {{w|Disney}}. There is also a joke about {{w|Pokémon}} in the phrase \"... evolves into ...\". Pokémon is a game where the player, a \"Trainer,\" has their Pokémon battle other Pokémon to level the Pokémon up. As the Pokémon levels up, they evolve into the next, more powerful, form of the Pokémon. Ron Paul and [[Cory Doctorow]] are fighting because Cory Doctorow believes he must support fellow bloggers no matter what, and Ron Paul wants the nomination that Black Hat, a blogger, is getting.\n\nThere is a subtle joke in the panel where Ron Paul and Cory Doctorow are firing at each other; the sound effect for Cory's guns is \"Boing! Boing!,\" which is the name of [http://boingboing.net Cory Doctorow's blog]. Also, a visual joke is that Cory's turret in panel 5 very much resembles an upside-down {{w|Dalek}}. The latter might not be an intentional joke, however, as Ron Paul's turret is designed the same way as Cory's and the head-mounted 'gun' here is an eyestalk on a Dalek, whose actual weaponry is on a mid-body mounting and not the revolving 'head' element. The quote \"Maybe if we dropped all the gold\" MAY be a reference to the Firefly episode \"Jaynestown\", in which Jayne sacrificed his partner in order to escape, before being forced to jettison 60,000 currency.\n\nThe reference to gold touches on Ron Paul's desire to see monetary policy once again be driven by the gold standard, namely that a country's currency value be driven not by its economic activity, but by the amount of physical gold it owns. Earlier in American history, this was the case; owning a dollar would (in theory) be owning one dollar's worth of gold somewhere in the treasury. This is in contrast with the current international practice, where countries are able to print an arbitrary quantity of paper money that is not necessarily backed by physical gold. Adherence to the gold standard is an extreme minority view; most economists, and the population at large, agree that the current system is much better.  This may also be a reference to the final scene in {{w|The Italian Job}}, where the heroes face a decision over losing a large quantity of gold or death, or a reference to {{w|The Mysterious Island}}, where the survivors have to drop the gold in their hot air balloon to prevent losing altitude.\n\nThe title text refers to the line of virtual light that streams out from the back of Tron's light grid vehicles. Normally it is a single, solid color, but in the comic, it is the colors and form of the American flag to show Ron's patriotism.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The Ron Paul Revolution blimp floats.]\n:Pilot: Sir!
