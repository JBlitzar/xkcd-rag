In the last line of panel 2, [[Cueball]] refers to the slogan \"There's an app for that\" from Apple's iPhone marketing.\n\nThen the third panel makes a joke anyway, at Apple's expense: apparently, this \"enlightenment app\" was rejected from Apple's app store, which is the only supported way to put third-party software on an iPhone. Apple has become infamous for rejecting apps from their app store without adequately explaining why. (Users of iPhones can sideload third party software using {{w|iOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking}} or {{w|iOS SDK|developer tools}}, but both are quite complicated.)\n\nIn the title text Cueball succumbs to the consumerism and marvels at the Motorola Droid's high (at the time) {{w|Pixel density|pixel density}}. Apple responded 9 months later by releasing the {{w|iPhone 4}} with a 326 ppi {{w|Retina Display}}.
