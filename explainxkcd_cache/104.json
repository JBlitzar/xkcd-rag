The text indicates that one of his loved ones used to be afraid of being taken away from him and being forgotten. It is not explicitly made clear whether the loved one in question is a woman with whom he is in love, a family member, or a relation of some other kind, but presumably the loved one is his partner.\n\nCueball had promised that he would always come looking for this person, but then they were actually taken from him. He reiterates that he was serious about his promise, and that he hopes they are not afraid, because he's coming to find them.\n\nIt's not clear exactly in what manner his loved one was taken from him, only that they were torn from his arms and vanished from this world. Though there are many other possible interpretations, this might be read to indicate that they have died and that Cueball is descending a cavern in search of the underworld where they have been taken.\n\nThe title text compares Cueball to the apparently unstoppable Terminator, from {{w|The Terminator|the 1984 film}} of the same name, in which Kyle Reese, talking to Sarah Connor, gives the following description of the Terminator: \"It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.\" The implication is that Cueball, motivated by love, can't be persuaded to stop looking for his loved one by any means, and that he will never stop looking until he finds them.\n\nThis may be a continuation of [[98: Fall Apart]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The panel is black with rough-edged white passages running down through it. Cueball is climbing onto a rope that is dangling down one of these passages. White text is in the black sections.]\n:You were afraid that you would disappear, that you would be lost and forgotten.\n:I held you tight against the dark and said that I would always come for you.\n:Then one day it happened. You were torn from my arms and vanished from this world.\n:Maybe you don't remember my promise. But I meant every word.\n:I hope you're not afraid, wherever you are.\n:You don't need to be.\n:I'm not.\n:I will find you.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nUntil 2023-09-28 or before, the image for this comic was rotated 180 degrees due to the EXIF metadata.\n\nFor technical reasons (see discussion below), some browsers displayed the image correctly, and some did not, during the time it was rotated.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n \t\t\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Terminator]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]"
