It could possibly be related to the recently discovered asteroid [https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2024/06/Close_approach_of_asteroid_2024_MK 2024 MK], which made a close approach to Earth on June 29, 2024, but it could be any of the {{w|Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Objects}} of the {{w|Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}'s Center for Near Earth Object Studies [https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/ ]. \n\nBlondie mentions that according to the astronomers, the asteroid only has 'a one-in-6000 chance of \"doing something cool\",' meaning that there is only a small chance that the asteroid will have a direct impact on Earth's surroundings. What is described as \"something cool\" would presumably be that the asteroid hits or almost hits the Earth or the Moon. She then states that further observations have shown that this will not happen and the asteroid will just be yet another boring dot in the sky. \n\nThe joke is that most people are afraid that a near-Earth asteroid would actually hit, and hope to hear that it will not. If the asteroid in this comic gets close enough that it will actually be a visible dot, then given the normal sizes of {{w|Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroids}}, it would indeed be very close to Earth. Many people interested in the night sky would find it interesting to see an asteroid with their naked eye.\n\nThe title text may refer to another asteroid that gets even closer than the one depicted, because this one should come closer than the Moon according to calculations (presumably by the astronomers). However, this asteroid will not hit the Moon even though it gets close, so the astronomers ask, \"What's the point?\". The comic is mute on the question whether the asteroid will hit the Earth, although this is generally very unlikely even for an asteroid passing closer than the Moon. Again Blondie implies that the astronomers hope for some visible effect.\n\nThis is the fourth comic in the last seven about space.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Close-up of Blondie as a news anchor speaking, alongside an image to the left of an asteroid passing by Earth.
