[[Cueball]] is clearly surprised when a bubble is actually formed by the filled sail.\n\nReaders infer from the title text that the water is also part of this fantastical scenario. If the boat was overturned ({{w|capsized}}) in a soap lagoon, a film would form between the mast and the boom (horizontal bar that adjusts the sail). The film would become like the sail in the comic, filling with air and forming bubbles until the film is used up.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sailing a lateen rigged sailboat.]\n:[The wind picks up, pushing the sail forward.]\n:[The wind builds strength. Cueball has to stand up to hold on to the main sheet, with curves depicting his tugging.]\n:[The distorted sail balloons out. Cueball is still holding on to the main sheet. More curves depict a stronger tugging.]\n:[Part of the sail separates into a bubble. Cueball starts to fall backwards. The sail begins to return to its normal shape.]\n:[Cueball lands on his rear and scratches his head in confusion as the sail-sized bubble floats away.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
