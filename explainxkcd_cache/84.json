A frequently expressed view in the U.S. (and in other countries) is that immigrants should learn English, which is the primary language in the United States.\n\nIn the comic, one character is arrogantly arguing the nativist position. However, the woman next to him interrupts him and says a phrase in the {{w|Cherokee}} language - \"Hello, my name is Sarah\" (<span lang=chr>ᎣᏏᏲ Sarah ᏓᏩᏙ</span> <span lang=chr-Latn>osiyo Sarah dawado</span>) - which is an Iroquoian language used by the Cherokee {{w|Native Americans in the United States|Native American}} people. Although Cherokee seems to be a relatively {{w|Cherokee#Origins|young culture}}, it is much more native to America than any European culture, such as English.\n\nThe woman is therefore effectively suggesting a \"what's good for the goose is good for the gander\" argument, that if the Europeans did not have to learn the native language, why should current immigrants learn English? She points out that even the English speakers are immigrants who did not learn the native language. Alternatively, she is saying that the term \"national language\" has no clear meaning, especially in the United States, where there is no official language; therefore, the \"language they speak there\" can be any of the languages spoken in the country: e.g. English, Spanish, German, Cantonese or Cherokee, to name just a few.\n\nThe title text reveals that Ponytail (identified as Sarah in the comic; probably the same Sarah that got engaged to [[Scott]]) is in fact Randall's friend; in the comic it is unclear who his friend is.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption on top:]\n:This happened to my friend:\n\n:[Three men and two women are standing in a row, next to a table on the right.]\n:Cueball: English should be the national language.
