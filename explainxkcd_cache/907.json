The layout is a parody of larger timescales of human or geologic history, e.g. \"Bronze Age\" or \"Iron Age\".\n\nThe \"ages\" identified and experiences typical at that age:\n\n===Table of \"ages\" identified and experiences typical at that age:===\n{| class=wikitable\n! scope=\"col\" | Age\n! Scope=“col” | Behavior\n! scope=\"col\" | Explanation\n|-\n| 0-3 || “[Non-sentient]” || Babies/toddlers are not self-sufficient and not intelligently communicative, which means they lack many of the elements that we associate with human intelligence. Sentience is difficult to clearly define, but it's often (and somewhat erroneously) correlated with self-awareness. There's disagreement about when self-awareness emerges in children, but some sources argue that it occurs around 2-3 years old. \n|-\n| 4-12 || “Everything is exciting!” || During this period, children are growing rapidly and learning many things for the first time. Between the newness of their experiences and a general lack of emotional inhibition, children of this age frequently exhibit a level of enthusiasm and excitement about the world which is rarely found in adults. \n|-\n| 13–17 || “Everything sucks!” || As children grow to be teenagers, they frequently have prolonged periods of personal and emotional turmoil. This age range includes the transition from childhood to adulthood, which carries multiple social, personal and biological implications. Many children of this age tend to encounter hard truths of life and lose much of the naivete of youth. This often leads to strongly cynical attitudes about life in general. \n|-\n| 18-22 || “Woooo college! Wooooo-“ [vomit] || This age is typically a young adult's first foray into the freedom of adulthood (frequently in college). With many of the restrictions of childhood removed, but lacking the experience and maturity of someone older, young adults will often take things to excess, including partying and drinking (which accounts for the vomiting).\n|-\n| 23-30 || “Relationships are ''hard''!” || Having grown out of the young adult stage, people in their twenties experience their first \"adult\" relationships, and generally encounter a great deal of difficulty and often no small amount of heartbreak.\n|-\n| 31-42 || “So are careers!” || Growing now into their thirties, many people become increasingly concerned about building careers. The more serious one becomes about a serious and long-term vocation, the more complexity they're likely to encounter. \n|-\n| 43-54 || “No daughter of mine is going out dressed like that!” || This is the general age range in which people might be the parents of teenagers. This phrase is a cliché, implying a parent is forbidding their daughter from wearing revealing clothing in public. This sort of interaction represents an older person who is focused on preventing perceived impropriety or danger, and is often thought of as an oppressive killjoy by the younger generation.\n|-\n| 55-75+ || \"[More sex than anyone is comfortable admitting]\" || For people with kids, this age is known as the \"empty nest\" phase, where their children have moved out on their own. For many people, this is also when retirement occurs. Both of these things bring about a significant increase in both free time and privacy. While many young people don't like to think about their parents being sexually active (and some would prefer to assume that older people don't have sex at all), there are many people who remain sexually active well into their later years.\n|-\n|}\n\nThe title text is a joke about the shortsightedness of many people (at any age) in believing their current age to be ideal.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A number line labeled \"age.\" The start point is 0, with points labeled 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70, and the line continues past the width of the panel. There are interstitial, non-labeled points. Above the line are labeled brackets, with the rightmost one trailing off in a dotted line.
