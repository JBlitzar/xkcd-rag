There have been no confirmed sightings, but HV 2112 and HV 11417, both in the {{w|Small Magellanic Cloud}}, have in the past been considered strong candidates.\n\nCueball is asking for a grant for funding for research into these theoretical astral bodies, the implication being that they are asking funding for telescope time, or even an entirely new telescope, in order to make such investigations possible. However, the caption reveals that he is asking for something completely different: funding to ''create'' the object, with a {{w|Gravity assist|gravitational slingshot}}.  Normally, astrophysics is an observational discipline, but the title of the comic (made explicit by the caption text) suggests that this is intended to be a 'practical' experiment to induce a TŻO into existence by actually sending a neutron star into our own {{w|Sun}}.\n\nCueball is complaining that no one is willing to fund this experiment to create the Thorne–Żytkow object for direct observation. Creating it would be impractical, for several reasons. First, you would need to find (or create!) a neutron star and bring it here, which requires amounts of energy, mass, and precision that we have no current possibility of achieving. Secondly, having a neutron star anywhere near the Sun would most likely destroy the solar system, or at least accelerate its transition to a red giant, which would likely result in {{w|Future_of_Earth#Red_giant_stage|Earth being engulfed by it}} and [[1606|ruining the weather]]. The funding body, presumably based on Earth, would probably find the study would not pass an {{w|Research_ethics|ethics review}}, and the end result would not generate a favorable {{w|environmental impact statement}}, given the almost inevitable destruction of our planet.\n\nA spin-off usually means something additional that was not originally planned. The title text in this comic is a two-layer joke on the phrase \"spin-off\", meaning that hitting the Sun off-center (from the right angle) would likely have many unintended consequences, but also cause the Sun to start rotating abnormally, due to the added angular momentum, in the same way as hitting a ball on the side makes it spin. A similar idea (the engulfment of a planet or companion star) has been proposed to explain the apparently anomalous rotation of the red supergiant {{w|Betelgeuse}}.{{acn}} \"Spin-off\" could also refer to material being flung off the Sun due to the impact of the neutron star. If the right material is sent in certain directions, it could have useful, or more likely just 'interesting', properties.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing on a circular podium with a screen behind him. He is holding his palm out towards an unseen audience. On the screen there is a large circle with a solid inner line and a ragged outer line. And then there are two much smaller circles also with solid inner lines and ragged outer lines. One of them is drawn just outside the large circle to the left. An arrow is pointing from this to the center of the large circle, breaking the large circle's edge. It points at the other small circle, which is drawn at the center of the large circle.]\n:Cueball: A Thorne-Żytkow object is a hypothesized nested star — a red giant with a neutron star inside it.\n:Cueball: So far, no TŻOs have been definitively observed, but your grant could help us change that.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:We're struggling to get funding for our project to slingshot a neutron star into the Sun.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]"
