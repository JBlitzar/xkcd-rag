Better to be on the safe side.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] has (by some ritual, judging by the {{w|pentagram}}) summoned himself from a {{w|Multiverse|parallel universe}}. [[Hairy]] suggests that Cueball should take advantage of this rare opportunity and {{w|Making out|make out}} with his other self.\n\nIn the third panel, Cueball seems to turn his head in response to the unexpected response. Hairy suggests that Cueball should make out with him instead, since he could also vanish at any moment. This indicates that Hairy may be attracted to Cueball, and he may have made the previous suggestion with the ulterior, voyeuristic motive of observing two attractive people making out with each other.\n\nThe title text is ambiguous. It could mean that Cueball should not risk his other self disappearing, or it could mean that the risk is Hairy disappearing.\n\nMaking out with yourself is also mentioned in [[267: Choices: Part 4]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Hairy are standing next to a large pentagram with candles at the points. A figure is hovering above it in a wave of energy.]\n:Cueball: Sweet. I summoned myself from a parallel universe.\n:Hairy: You know, he could vanish at any moment.\n:Hairy: You should take this chance to make out with yourself.\n:Hairy: . . . You know, '''<u>I</u>''' could vanish at any moment.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Homosexuality]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]"
