([http://www.xkcd.com/barrel_cropped_(1).jpg Part 1] and [http://www.xkcd.com/barrel_mommies.jpg Part 2])</div>\n}}\n\nThis was the twenty-third comic [[LiveJournal|originally posted to LiveJournal]]. The previous one was [[40: Light]], and the next one was [[23: T-shirts]].\n\n==Explanation==\nIn the first two comics in the [[:Category:The Boy and his Barrel|The Boy and his Barrel series]], the boy is floating in the ocean in a barrel, making fairly innocent points about life's uncertainty. In this comic, the view has zoomed out considerably, and the boy is seen to be on the edge of a gigantic {{w|whirlpool}}. Thus, there is now a palpably heightened sense of danger, though the boy's reaction continues to be innocent wonder. The comic's visual composition is reminiscent of {{w|File:Maelstrom-Clarke.jpg|a classic 1919 illustration}} by {{w|Harry Clarke}}, made for {{w|Edgar Allan Poe}}'s 1841 short story \"{{w|A Descent into the Maelström}}.\" In the short story, the main character escapes from drowning by using a barrel to escape The Maelström.\n\nThe two links in the original caption used to link to the pictures of the first and third comic in the series, but they are now defunct. Here is the last part of the caption containing links to the archived pages: \"([https://web.archive.org/web/20060529063505/http://www.xkcd.com/barrel_cropped_(1).jpg Part 1] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060529063505/http://www.xkcd.com/barrel_mommies.jpg Part 2])\".\n\nThis is the fourth in a six-part series of comics whose parts were randomly published during the first several dozen strips. The series features [[Barrel Boy]], a character that is different from what would quickly become the xkcd [[stick figure]] style. The full series can be found [[:Category:The Boy and his Barrel|here]]. After Randall released the full [http://liveweb.archive.org/web/20070207052159/http://www.xkcd.com/barrel.html The Boy and his Barrel] story on the site, it became clear that the original comic [[20: Ferret]] was also part of the series. The comics are listed in the order chosen by Randall:\n* [[1: Barrel - Part 1]]\n* [[20: Ferret]]\n* [[11: Barrel - Part 2]]\n* [[22: Barrel - Part 3]]\n* [[25: Barrel - Part 4]]\n* [[31: Barrel - Part 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A large and deep vortex is in the center; spinning water covers the whole panel. Barrel Boy in a floating barrel is near the edge, apparently about to be sucked in.]\n:Barrel Boy: wow!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 23]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:The Boy and his Barrel|04]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Barrel 04]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Barrel Boy]]"
