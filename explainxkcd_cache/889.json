While an offscreen character is panicking over deleting a file, the turtle is content with just being a turtle. The text saying \"turtles have it figured out, man\" indicates that Randall appreciates this simpler mode of thought.\n\nBased on its appearance, it is possible that the turtle is a tortoise (biologists call all ''testudines'' turtles, and tortoises are the family of land-based turtles), which is also supported by the fact that tortoises tend to have much longer lifespans (100 to 150 years) than sea turtles and terrapins (approximately 80 years).\n\nAn alternative explanation could be that the satisfaction of knowledge that the creature has poses an obstruction to his venturing out and finding its true identity. It was told that it's a turtle, thus, it continues to believe, even though it's wrong. The minor panicking of humans actually is a driving force of our sentience.\n\nThe title text is possibly a reference to [[231: Cat Proximity]]. It also resembles Towelie's Catchphrase from {{w|South Park}}.\n\nThe text at the bottom 'Turtles have it figured out, man' could be a reference to the turtle in {{w|Finding Nemo}}, who speaks in a similar manner.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[There is a turtle.]\n:Off-panel: Oh, crap, I deleted the file!\n\n:[There is a turtle.]\n:Turtle (thinking): I am a turtle.\n\n:[There is a turtle.]\n:Off-panel: No, wait, there it is.\n\n:[There is a turtle.]\n:Turtle (thinking): I am a turtle.\n\n:[There is a turtle.]\n:50 Years Later:\n:Turtle (thinking): I am a turtle.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Turtles have it figured out, man.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Turtles]]"
