It was among the [[:Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com|last eleven comics]] posted both on LiveJournal and on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] after the new site was launched. This comic was published on the same day across both sites, but not all of them shared the same posting day.\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are standing together in the middle of a strangely expressionist landscape/environment. As indicated by the words in the comic, they have simply '''found''' each other, implying that there is no relationship between them other than running into each other.\n \nAs indicated in the title text, there is nothing else to say about how they met. In the original caption, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] reassures his audience that he hasn't stopped making nerdy comics and puns, because a few of the previous comics diverged from these topics. [[47: Counter-Red Spiders]] covered the [[Red Spiders]], and [[46: Secrets]] covered relationships.
