Newfoundland ... microplate collided with, uhh ... Labrador.' 'Ok, now you're definitely just naming dogs.' 'Wait, no, that's actually almost correct.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis is another one of [[Randall|Randall's]] [[:Category:Tips|Tips]], this time a Geology Tip.\n\n[[Ponytail]] is describing the origin of some rock formations to [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]]. She apparently forgot the names of the {{w|Plate tectonics|microplates}} and the {{w|Geologic time scale|age}} when the {{w|subduction}} occurred, so she substituties them with names of {{w|Dog breed|dog breeds}} ({{w|Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian}}, {{w|Laika (dog breed)|Laika}} and {{w|Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian}}) to seem knowledgeable and impress her audience. \n\nAlthough no microplates or geological ages with these names exist, this is not obvious for people outside of the field, as dog breeds are often named after geographic regions.  For example {{w|Dalmatia}} is the name of a region in {{w|Croatia}}, and a microplate named after it could exist (possibly as a fragment of the former {{w|Adriatic Plate}}). Likewise, a Laika Plate ''could'' be named after the {{w|Shepherd Islands|Laika Island}} in {{w|Vanuatu}}; however, the name is unrelated to the island and originates from the Russian word лайка (lit. \"barker\", a generic name for several breeds of hunting dogs and also the given name of the {{w|Laika|first dog in space on Sputnik 2}}). Geological ages are often named after place where the first rocks dating from the age were found e.g. the {{w|Devonian}} is named after the {{w|ceremonial counties of England|English ceremonial county}} of {{w|Devon}} (aka Devonshire), while the {{w|Permian}} is named after the {{w|Russia}}n city of {{w|Perm}}. Thus, a Pomeranian Age named after {{w|Pomerania}}, a region on the {{w|Baltic Sea}} split between {{w|Poland}} and {{w|Germany}}, might reasonably exist.\n\nSo the comic concludes in the caption with one of Randall's many [[:Category:Tips|tips]], this time a geology tip, about how it is possible to pretend to be more knowledgeable regarding geology (and to bluff others not educated in the science) by just inserting dog breeds names instead of real names as no one remembers the names of all the microplates. An actual geologist, unlike Ponytail, would not be fooled.\n\nThe title text continues the situation until Ponytail starts to run out of dog breeds. Her audience catches on... until one of them chimes in that her \"explanation\" did name two real geological features: the dog breeds {{w|Labrador Retriever|Labrador}} and {{w|Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland}} are named after the two Canadian regions of {{w|Labrador}} and {{w|Newfoundland}} respectively. Geologically, Labrador is the easternmost section of the {{w|Canadian Shield}}, the ancient core of the {{w|North America}}n continent. In contrast, Newfoundland (especially western Newfoundland) was formed from {{w|terrane|terranes}}, the remnants of a series of plates that collided with - and subducted beneath - North America. Some geologists have assigned the name \"Newfoundland Plate\" to one of these former microplates that Newfoundland now comprises. However, the title text explanation is not likely to be entirely accurate, because the most significant mountains in Newfoundland are the {{w|Long Range Mountains}}, which are the northernmost of the {{w|Appalachian Mountains}}, created when {{w|Africa}} and North America collided to form {{w|Pangaea}}; no mountain range is identified as being the result of the collision of the Newfoundland Plate with North America.\n\nSubduction was featured in a previous comic [[1388: Subduction License]]. And later mentioned in the title text of [[3021: Seismologists]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail is gesturing toward some rock formations in a grass field while addressing Megan and Cueball who are looking down at the rocks, Cueball with a hand to his chin.]\n:Ponytail: This bedrock likely formed as the Dalmatian microplate subducted under East Laika during the Upper Pomeranian.\n:Cueball: Ah, yes.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Geology Tip: There are so many microplates and ages that no one remembers them all, so in a pinch you can bluff with dog breeds.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Tips]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Subduction]]"
