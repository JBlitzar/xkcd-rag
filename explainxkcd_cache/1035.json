    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number = 1035\n| date = March 28, 2012\n| title = Cadbury Eggs\n| image = cadbury_eggs.png\n| titletext = When they moved production from New Zealand to the UK and switched from the runny white centers to the thick, frosting-like filling, it got way harder to cook them scrambled.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Cadbury Creme Egg|Cadbury Eggs}} are a chocolate, egg-shaped candy with a white and yellow filling. They are supposed to replicate a real egg with a hard exterior and soft interior.\n\nIn this comic, [[Cueball]] is trying to say that {{w|Soft drink|sodas}} have way too much sugar to even be appealing as beverages, because they contain as much sugar as 2 or 3 Cadbury Eggs, and one Cadbury Egg alone makes him feel gross. (A 12 oz can equals 355 mL, while a 20 oz bottle is about 590 mL.)\n\nHowever, [[Megan]] interprets this in precisely the opposite way to what Cueball intended. Instead of comparing soda to Cadbury Eggs, she compares Cadbury Eggs to soda. If a [[1070|few]] Cadbury Eggs have the same amount of sugar as soda, Megan can eat as many as she wants year-round in place of soda, with no additional guilt. Cadbury Eggs are usually consumed around {{w|Easter}} — which is anywhere between March 22nd and May 7th, depending on whether one is consulting the {{w|General Roman Calendar|Catholic}} or {{w|Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|Orthodox}} calendar.\n\nThe title text mentions the closure of the {{w|Cadbury Creme Egg#Manufacture in New Zealand|manufacture in New Zealand}} in 2009 and the change of the filling from runny to thick as a consequence. The joke here is the comparison to real eggs, which can be cooked {{w|Scrambled_eggs|scrambled}}, the new thick filling is not liquid enough to be cooked in a pan, as was the old runny filling. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6wfXej1IG4 People did it anyway.]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two Cadbury eggs, one in the foil, the other out of the foil and broken open to reveal the gooey center.]\n:A Cadbury Egg has about 20g of sugar. (25g outside the US.) \"One Cadbury Egg\" is a nice unit of sugar content.\n\n:[A can of soda with an equals sign and two eggs; a bottle of soda with an equals sign and three eggs.]\n:One 12oz. can of soda has about two Cadbury eggs worth of sugar. One 20oz. bottle has three.\n\n:[Two unwrapped Cadbury eggs, with an arrow indicating they should be placed in a glass of water.]\n:One Cadbury egg is enough to make me feel kinda gross. Now when I see Coke or Snapple or Nestea or whatever, I imagine drinking a couple of dissolved Cadbury eggs.\n\n:[Megan puts her hand to her chin in thought, Cueball has his arms out in exclamation.]\n:Megan: Wow. Huh. So the takeaway is... I can eat Cadbury eggs by the handful all season and feel no worse about it than I do about soda?\n:Cueball: That's not really— \n:Megan: This is ''awesome!''\n:Cueball: *sigh*\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cadbury Eggs and the high sugar content of soda are referenced again in [[1793: Soda Sugar Comparisons]].\n*The Cadbury egg/soda comparison is also mentioned in the what if? {{what if|74|Soda Planet}}.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
