When [[Hairy]] makes a comment about the weather, Cueball launches into a detailed technical discussion, not realizing Hairy is simply trying to engage in small-talk. Only weather geeks would have this problem, but this topic is a common opening for a conversation in casual small-talk. Cueball switches to small-talk once he realizes that Hairy is confused and didn't expect this level of technical information.\n\nAs to the jargon:\n*{{w|Jet stream|Jet streams}} are strong air currents high in the atmosphere which have a big influence on the weather. \n*18z is 18:00 {{w|Coordinated Universal Time|UTC}} (6&nbsp;PM in London, 10&nbsp;AM in California). See {{w|ISO 8601}} at Wikipedia. The letter \"Z\" is used as 'Zulu' in the {{w|NATO phonetic alphabet}}, meaning just UTC.\n*GFS is the {{w|Global Forecast System}} (also known as NCEP-GFS). It is a computer model used by the {{w|National Weather Service}} to predict the weather up to 16 days in advance. The model is run 4 times a day and the output is distinguished by the UTC hour it was started (18z in this case).\n*Part of the prediction is the {{w|atmospheric pressure}} expressed in {{w|Bar (unit)|millibars}} (or mb). 960&nbsp;mb is very low pressure, which is usually associated with seriously bad weather (for comparison, the record low pressure for Minnesota was 963&nbsp;mb until 1998).\n*\"Think it'll verify?\": A forecast \"verifies\" when an analysis of observations at the forecast time are found to match the forecast. Cueball is asking if Hairy thinks the prediction of a 960&nbsp;mb low will be shown to have been correct.\n\nThe title text clarifies the problem weather nuts like Cueball here have: Unlike other geeky pursuits (like, say, the {{w|Derinkuyu Underground City|Derinkuyu Underground Cities}}, [[1368: One Of The|one of the]] most well-known {{w|History of Turkey|archaeological sites in Turkey}}) weather is a fairly common small talk subject. As a result, weather geeks have to be constantly vigilant so as not to launch into technical monologues.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Hairy are talking.]\n:Hairy: So, how 'bout this weather?\n:Cueball: I ''know,'' right? The whole jet stream layer is ''nuts!''\n:Hairy: Um, sure...\n:Cueball: The 18z GFS forecasts 960mb by Tuesday. Think it'll verify?\n:Hairy: What?\n:Cueball: ...Right. Sorry. Uh, yeah! Weather sure has been crazy.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Weather geeks have it tough.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nIn the [https://xkcd.com/1324/info.0.json official transcript for this comic], [[Cueball]] is referred to as \"Cueball\". This is very unusual, as Randall usually uses terms such as \"Person 1\" in [[Transcript|his transcripts]] and [[Cueball#Name|refrains from giving a distinctive name to the character]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]\n[[Category:Weather]]"
