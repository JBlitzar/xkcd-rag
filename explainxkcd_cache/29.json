The previous was [[34: Flowers]], and the next one was [[28: Elefino]].\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Man in Hats.png|400px|thumb|right|[http://meninhats.com/d/20040225.html The ''Men in Hats'' comic] on which Black Hat is based on.]]\n\n[[Cueball]] speaks to [[Black Hat]] about the {{w|Holocaust}} and {{w|Adolf Hitler}}. Hitler was the leader of {{w|Nazi}} Germany beginning in 1933 and starting {{w|World War II}} in 1939 by attacking Poland. During that war, the Germans (under Hitler's leadership) killed millions of people; most of them were Jews, but other ethnic groups, homosexuals, and the mentally disabled were all targeted as well. This has come to be known as the Holocaust. Black Hat's comment that Hitler wanted to be a painter, but did not get into art school, is historically accurate. He applied to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts twice. In any event, Cueball implies in the second frame that had Hitler been accepted into art school, the course of history might have changed, and the Holocaust might never have occurred. Black Hat suggests that perhaps God intentionally prevented Hitler from becoming an artist because God is an \"art lover\" and {{w|Paintings by Adolf Hitler|Hitler's art}} was terrible.\n\nAs with many of the earlier comics, the title text explains the joke rather than adding to it. It implies that God would have preferred the Holocaust to have occurred rather than allow Hitler to make some bad paintings. Such a comment that God could be so callous would surely be offensive to many people. Cueball's reaction to this shocking statement is relatively mild and suggests that Black Hat has made such controversial statements before. He will make a similarly controversial and Nazi-related statement again in [[984: Space Launch System]]. The title text also says Black Hat is based on a character named Aram from a now discontinued webcomic called ''[http://www.meninhats.com Men in Hats]'' and, in the original caption, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] directed the user to a specific ''Men in Hats'' [http://meninhats.com/d/20040225.html comic about parenting]. Like Black Hat, Aram frequently made judgmental, insulting, or controversial comments in a very emotionless manner. Aram wore a dark grey suit with a red bowtie and a black top hat with a white strip above the brim. Black Hat's hat clearly evolved from the top hat design later in xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Cueball are talking together in the same position in all four panels.]\n:Cueball: Learning about the Holocaust has really shaken my belief in God.\n\n:Black Hat: You know, as a young man, Hitler was rejected from art school.\n:Cueball: Yeah... shame he didn't get in.\n\n:Black Hat: Well, have you seen any of his paintings? They're <u>awful</u>. Defy all rules of composition.\n:Cueball: What are you suggesting?\n\n:Black Hat: Maybe there <u>is</u> a god, but he's a real art lover.\n:Cueball: This is why I don't go out in public with you.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring [[Black Hat]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 31]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring politicians]]"
