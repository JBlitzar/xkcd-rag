His phone also knows of a person called John, which seems to be the real name of the same person, although Cueball appears to have been unaware or forgetful of that fact. The humor arises when Cueball mentions this to \"Surf King\", who is flabbergasted that Cueball is not aware of this fact.\n\nSome algorithm that manages the contact-list has been offering (or trying) to merge the contact details into a single entry, as having the same core details, which intrigues Cueball but without him understanding why. Instead he directs a comment about this to \"@Surf King\", who apparently did not deign to respond (a typed-out ellipsis as a common shorthand for being rendered speechless, as opposed to the temporary \"[[Typing Notifications|Currently typing]]\" ellipsis).\n\nCueball's follow-up comment is clearly prompted by the realization that his 'two' contacts both share an interest in surfing, perhaps having been in separate group conversations with both John and Surf King personae in the interim, and he decides to revisit the issue. But from Surf King's response it looks like Cueball and Surf King have been chatting (indeed, in this specific chatroom) for several years, making it mildly impressive that Cueball apparently never made the connection between his identities in that time.\n\nThe title text jokes that John and his alter-ego \"Surf King\" seem different enough from each other that they might not get along well. Given that they are the same person, this might imply self-hatred or significant social masking on John's part.\n\nThis is another example of Cueball demonstrating [[1674: Adult|extremely nerdy habits]]. This can possibly be explained by developing different kinds of experiences at a significantly different rates than more extroverted and social individuals due to a much higher proportion of the time and focus in both childhood and adulthood spent doing technical work. Due to this different proportion of experiences, such people can miss normal conversational implications like this, while demonstrating great aptitude in less common scenarios such as engineering. Many see these kinds of people as the intended readership of the comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball is holding a phone and chatting in DMs]\n:Cueball: @Surf King Weird, my phone keeps trying to merge your contact with John's\n:Surf King: ...\n:Cueball: Hey, you two should meet up-He's into surfing too\n:Surf King: Oh my God\n:Surf King: Are you serious\n:Surf King: You've been in this chat with me for '''four years!'''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I wonder who holds the record for accidentally doing this the longest.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Phones]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
