Assuming they both take the one in front of them, each conveyor belt will speed them up a little bit more with little effort on their part, ultimately reaching a point where they are going very fast and are close enough to be able to high-five each other.\n\nFor the most central conveyor belts, there is no speed indicated: it could still be 5x, or a further increase to 6x. No number could also indicate a mere 1x or even a non-moving belt, which would make the whole setup tricky for a much different reason. The average moving walkway speed globally is 3 feet/second (~1m/s), so Cueball and Megan would only be travelling about 2/3 average human running speed by the time they meet. Even with the opposing forces added to their high five, it would be very unlikely for them to injure each other (though the slap would more than likely be painful). If they are additionally running along their belt setups, it might hurt some more.\n\nThe title text may be a reference to a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA music video] made by {{w|Here It Goes Again|OK Go, \"Here It Goes Again\"}}, in which the band jumps on and off of various treadmills in a similar fashion. A series of parallel accelerating conveyor belts is also a long-distance travel mechanism used in Robert A. Heinlein's {{w|The Roads Must Roll}} and in Isaac Asimov's Robot Detective novels.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan on the opposite far ends of a bidirectional moving sidewalk.  Arrows indicate that one half will carry Cueball from left to right, while the other half will carry Megan from right to left.  In each direction, the sidewalk is made up of a series of individual conveyors.]\n:Cueball: Ready?\n:\n:[A diagram labels various individual conveyors as follows.]\n:[Outermost conveyors:] Moving Sidewalk \n:[Second and second-last conveyors:] Moving Sidewalk (2x Speed)\n:[Next conveyors:] 3x Speed\n:[Next conveyors:] 4x Speed\n:[Innermost conveyors:] 5x Speed\n:[Spot between the two sidewalks, directly in the center:] High-Five Location\n:\n:Megan: Ready.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/5/52/20130218143130%21moving_sidewalks.png original version of this comic], all the arrows were facing in the opposite direction. This was later fixed.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
