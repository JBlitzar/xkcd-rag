At first, it seems as if he agrees to Cueball's statement, adding his own morbid point of view as if he follows the same psychology. Cueball agrees and continues the conversation, explaining how anything anyone does won't matter eventually, a common belief attributed to nihilists. Beret Guy responds rather dismissively and Cueball stops to ask Beret Guy why he's climbing the tree. When asked why he is doing so, Beret Guy responds with a cheerful and optimistic response about the future more fitting for his character, completely going against Cueball’s lecture. Cueball is now either trying to convince him otherwise or is put off from the sudden change of mood, while Beret Guy is oblivious to this. [[Squirrels]] are a reoccurring character in xkcd.\n\nThe title text can be taken in two different ways. One way it can be interpreted is that Cueball is telling Beret Guy to have “normal existential angst” like other guys. People do usually have angst, but not in a existential, nihilistic sort of way. It can also be interpreted as Beret Guy scolding Cueball for having “existential angst” of an abnormal sort rather than having a normal amount of existential angst.\n\n{{w|Nihilism}} is a philosophy that rejects some facets of existence. Usually, it's viewed as the idea that everything is pointless because we’re all eventually going to die. This is, however, just a specific “position” of nihilism called {{w|existential nihilism}}. Other positions include the idea that {{w|moral nihilism|moral values don't exist}} and that {{w|philosophical skepticism|knowledge is impossible}}. The concept of nihilism can be found in the fields of {{w|ethics}}, {{w|epistemology}}, {{w|metaphysical philosophy}}, and {{w|axiology}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy and Cueball approach a tree while talking.]\n:Cueball: There is no God. Our existence is without purpose.\n:[Beret Guy looks toward Cueball]\n:Beret Guy: Oh, definitely.\n:Beret Guy: We are adrift in an uncaring void indifferent to all our mortal toil.\n:[Cueball stops walking]\n:Cueball: Exactly! In the end, nothing we do matters.\n:[Beret Guy starts to climb the tree.]\n:Beret Guy: Totally.\n:Cueball: We just... Why are you climbing that tree?\n:[Beret Guy is now completely in the tree’s branches.]\n:Beret Guy: Because the future is an adventure! Come on!\n:Cueball: But--\n:Beret Guy: Hey! I found ''squirrels''!\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring [[Beret Guy]] and the first comic that mentions [[Squirrels]]. The first drawing of squirrels in a comic is in [[635: Locke and Demosthenes]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Squirrels]]"
