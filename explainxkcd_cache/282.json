But in fact, {{w|biofuel}} is a big industry today. It is criticized now and then, because it can affect food prices and is believed to exacerbate world hunger. Next comes a reference to the famous quote, \"Mussolini made the trains run on time,\" an oft-quoted piece of [https://www.snopes.com/history/govern/trains.asp propaganda] from Italy under Fascist dictator {{w|Benito Mussolini}}. The pun is made on the fact that {{w|Thyme|thyme}} (an herb, or as in this comic, a spice) and {{w|time}} (the universal phenomenon, as in the original quote) are {{w|homophones}}. But the organic matter thyme could technically be used as fuel. [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] later made another joke on the fact that thyme and time are homophones: [[1123: The Universal Label]].\n\nThe title text may be interpreted in one of two ways. It may be attributed to the pun-maker, in which case he makes no apology for his corny joke, or it may be attributed to Cueball, in which case he makes no apology for the termination of friendship, since the pun was too terrible.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball at a computer and a friend standing nearby.]\n:Cueball: Wow – Engines can burn vegetable oil.\n:Friend: Well, sure. You can burn most any organic matter. Corns, leaves, spices...\n:Cueball: Spices? Really?\n:Friend: Sure – Mussolini made the trains run on thyme.\n:Cueball: ...\n:Cueball: We are no longer friends.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
