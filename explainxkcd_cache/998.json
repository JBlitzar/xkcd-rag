This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the calendar used by the Mayan culture. Knowing this, some thought that the world was going to end on that date.\n\nConsequently, a lot of people were talking about the Mayans, concerned that the world might end. After December 21, 2012 passed uneventfully, everyone was less concerned about the Mayans, because the world didn't end.{{Citation needed}} It is worthy of note that this comic was published nearly a year ''before'' the \"significant\" date and that Randall predicted both the hype and the aftermath perfectly.\n\nThere is a measure of irony to be had in how the Mayans who still exist today were largely ignored by the doomsayers. \"Or acknowledging that huge city-building ancient American civilizations existed at all.\"\n\nIn the final frame, [[Megan]] parodies the phrase, \"Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it,\" applying a twist to suggest an academic context. In most American schools, a Grade Point Average is computed by assigning numeric value to each letter grade: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0; receiving high marks (all A's) thus yields a 4.0 GPA. However, if you \"Fail to learn from History\" — that is, get a failing grade, F, and had at least 3 other classes (not an unusual course load) — you would still get a 3.0 with A's in those other classes. With a more common workload of eight courses per year, GPA as high as 3.5 can actually be reached in those circumstances. She is making the callous — if roundabout — observation that failing to grasp history, while no doubt troubling, isn't an academic show-stopper. Her comment may also be taken to suggest that people who feared the Mayan \"prediction\" of the end of the world would come to pass had failed to appropriately extrapolate from the numerous other faulty {{w|List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events|predictions of the end of the world}}. In fact the Mayans never actually predicted the end of the world with their calendar, they just didn't have infinite stone.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe title text jokes that to make up for the lack of Mayan discussion, Randall plans to spend 2013 talking solely about Mayans. For obvious reasons,{{Citation needed}} people would probably get sick of this very quickly, hence his comment that his relationships might not fare well. Thankfully, as of 2014, not a single published xkcd comic of 2013 featured any Mayans, so we're pretty sure this promise wasn't kept.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: Well, it's 2012.\n\n:[Cueball and Megan in frameless panel.]\n:Megan: Yup.\n:Megan: Only 354 days left until everybody abruptly stops talking about Mayans.\n\n:[Cueball and Megan in wide panel to fit longer text content.]\n:Cueball: Or thinking about Mayans.\n:Cueball: Or acknowledging that huge city-building ancient American civilizations existed at all.\n:Megan: You know what they say — those who fail to learn from history can still manage a 3.0 if they ace their other subjects.\n\n==Trivia==\n*December 21 is the 355th day of the year (and the 356th in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar and because this comic was released on January 2 and 2012 was a leap year there were exactly 354 days left.\n*Two years later another New Years comic with just the new years number as the title was released: [[1311: 2014]]. But actually the content of that comic was more related to the previous comic before this one [[997: Wait Wait]], which is also a New Year comic, that took a look at what could happen in 2012, just as 2014 does for 2014... In 2016 a comic, with only the new year as the name theme, occurred again [[1624: 2016]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:New Year]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|2012]]\n[[Category:Calendar]]"
