Ha, ha get it? Oh god, don't throw those syringes! Your baby's fine!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIt is an old superstition that a {{w|groundhog}} (a type of rodent akin to a large squirrel) can predict the seasonal change from winter to spring in early February.  A groundhog that sees his shadow and retreats back in his home predicts another six weeks of winter, while a groundhog that does not see its shadow predicts an early spring.  This event is celebrated in a small town in western Pennsylvania, where {{w|Punxsutawney Phil}} serves as the forecaster in an annual ceremony on February 2.  This, in turn, becomes the basis for the comedy movie {{w|Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day''}}, which is also referenced in [[1076: Groundhog Day]].\n\nThe joke here is that, instead of a groundhog predicting when spring will come, the baby is predicting the change in season. Evidently, he predicts that we will have six more weeks of winter.\n\nThe title text indicates that the doctor was joking about the baby retreating back inside. He then makes a pun that results in an assault by the mother. The word ''delivery'' can mean the act of giving birth or the presentation of a joke. He then indicates that the baby is fine.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In a delivery room.]\n:Doctor: There's the head... he's looking at me... Wait, he's crawling back into the womb.\n:Megan: What?!\n:Doctor: Yeah, it's the darnedest thing.\n:Megan: Um, what does it mean?\n:Doctor: My guess? Six more weeks of winter.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Comics with babies]]\n[[Category:Medicine]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
