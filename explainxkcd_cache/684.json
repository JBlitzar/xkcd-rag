Are you going to get married?' 'I, uh, don't know--' 'Well, do you love her?' '...' 'Anyway, what were you saying about the movie?'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic illustrates how someone in a new relationship tends to be overly eager and giddy to let everyone know about it, while others tend to not be all that interested. The character on the left is so excited to let everyone know, that he goes off panel to get a ladder and a loudspeaker. The second character thinks it should be legal to murder (or at least wound) him for this annoyance if he acts like this for more than a week. The first character is so giddy that he doesn't notice what he has done and even tries to mention his girlfriend again.\n\nThe title text describes a very harsh way to respond to this annoyance. Since someone in the position of the first character is so excited about the new romantic commitment in their life, their friend brings up the much greater and more serious commitment of marriage. If they have only been dating for a week or less, it is probably much too early for them to seriously think about marriage. The friend then implies that if they aren't already excited to marry her, then he doesn't really love her. The end result is that the first character doesn't want to talk about his relationship anymore.\n\n''{{w|Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar}}'' is a 2009 movie that was very popular in theaters at the time of this comic. It in fact became the highest-grossing film, at that time, until being overtaken by ''{{w|Avengers: Endgame}}'' in 2019. It regained that title in 2021, due in no small part to being re-released in China.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and a friend are talking.]\n:Cueball: Avatar? Yeah, I saw it last week with...\n\n:[Cueball walks out of the panel.]\n\n:[Cueball returns with a ladder and megaphone.]\n\n:[Cueball stands on top of the ladder, shouting through a megaphone.]\n:Cueball: '''''...MY GIRLFRIEND.'''''\n\n:Friend: You know, if this phase of your relationship lasts more than a week, I'm legally allowed to stab you both.\n:Cueball: What phase?\n:Cueball: So, did I mention I'm seeing someone?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
