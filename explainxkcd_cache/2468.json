The joke in this comic is that Cueball has a massive sum of points that were not scored in the current game but rather handed down from his grandfather. Board games do not normally include an inheritance from previous sessions, in contrast to real life where some people become wealthy by inheriting vast sums of money from ancestors. Such inheritances tend to lead to 'successes' in life for those who have done little to earn their wealth.\n\nCueball offers to distribute a trifling fraction of his points to the other players, teasing them, but he will still have an insurmountable advantage.{{Citation needed}} Despite his 'generosity', no one wants to play a game that they have no chance of winning.  The value of his score, 10,019, seems to indicate that he \"earned\" 19 points during the course of the game (less than his competitors) and then added 10,000 from his 'inheritance'.\n\nThe comic may be a reference to {{w|Category:Economic simulation board games\n|economic simulation board games}} like {{w|Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly''}}, which was created as a critique to capitalism; in this case, no one can win the game against people who start out with a large amount of accumulated wealth. See also the '[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/a-small-loan-of-a-million-dollars Small Loan of a Million Dollars]' trope of a profile in which the author or subject discusses the simple tricks they used to retire early or buy a house, often involving a [https://twitter.com/macaulaybalkan/status/1398805590030241792 hurried admission] of financial assistance from a family member.\n\nThe title text asks Cueball if he has any moral qualms over the source of these points, then indicates his grandfather's fortune was made through {{w|factory farming}} in the farm-themed board game {{w|Agricola_(board_game)|''Agricola''}}. Factory farming is a broad term for applying mass-production techniques to agriculture, treating both plants and animals as commodities to be processed as efficiently as possible. These techniques are condemned, at least in some circles, as being cruel to livestock, in addition to having serious environmental and land-use implications, among other criticisms. The implication is that Cueball's grandfather somehow managed to introduce an immoral and/or socially harmful mechanic into a board game, greatly enriching himself and his heirs. This echoes another concern about inherited wealth: that the source of the money may have been unethical, but the heirs still get to enjoy the advantages, without considering themselves accountable for the harm. Cueball brushes off this criticism with the claim that the change was inevitable, which is a common response to analogous real-life concerns. The game Agricola was previously mentioned in [[696: Strip Games]] and [[778: Scheduling]].\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Ponytail, White Hat, Megan, and Cueball are playing a board game.
