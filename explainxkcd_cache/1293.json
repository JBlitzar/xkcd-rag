Because of this, the job interview becomes increasingly bizarre, starting with Beret Guy's assertion that the company headquarters is a \"real building [he] found\", implying that the building's reality might be in question. In addition, \"finding\" the building may imply that he does not own or rent it, but simply found it empty and moved in. He says his company makes \"stuff for phones\", but then adds, \"like apps and stickers,\" two wildly different products in terms of both production and profitability.{{Citation needed}} He is strangely vague about both the position (\"someone to write on our computers\") and the salary (\"a bunch of paychecks\"). Then he mentions ghosts, which is either a powerful disincentive from joining the company, yet another sign that Beret Guy is mentally unsound, or both.\n\nThe strip finishes with Beret Guy plugging a cord into what appears to be an electrical outlet clumsily labeled \"Soup,\" which then, implausibly, actually starts dispensing soup. Most electrical outlets do not function like this.{{Citation needed}} However, this is a typical behaviour of Beret Guy - see a similar example in: [[1395: Power Cord]]. It is possible that the electrical outlet is connected to a pipe which supplies soup from a soup reservoir or kitchen elsewhere in the facility, which would require the fixture to have a specialist valve-connector and the 'cable' to involve a pipe with a self-sealing end that 'keys' the valve open. It may even be more likely, given Beret Guy's [[:Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy|abilities]], that the outlet is taking electricity from a suitable power supply and the cord ultimately uses mass-energy conversion to turn it into soup; this would be in line with the possible operating mechanism of Beret Guy's water-creating dam in [[2710: Hydropower Breakthrough]].\n\nThe title text may be a reference to the biblical story of {{w|Job (biblical figure)|Job}} (pronounced with a long O to rhyme with globe), who was put through many horrendous ordeals to test his faith in God. This suggests that the interviewee will be taking on not a \"job experience\" but rather a \"Job experience\" (i.e. the job will be a horrendous ordeal).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy walks in, followed by Hairy.]\n:Beret Guy: Welcome to our company! We're headquartered here, in this real building I found!\n\n:[Both people sit down at a table. The 'hire' has a tray with food and a beverage. Beret Guy has a bowl. In the adjacent wall, there is a power outlet with a paper label taped to it marked \"Soup\". A small roll of wire sits next to Beret Guy's chair.]\n:Hairy: What do you.. ''do''?\n:Beret Guy: We make stuff for phones! Like apps and stickers.\n\n:[Beret Guy grabs the roll of wire.]\n:Beret Guy: We want to hire you to write on our computers. We can offer you a bunch of paychecks! <small>There are ghosts here.</small>\n\n:[Beret Guy unrolls the wire and plugs it into the wall.]\n:Hairy: ...Are you sure this is a company?\n:Beret Guy: I hope so!\n\n:[Soup streams out of the plugged-in wire into Beret Guy's bowl.]\n\n==Trivia==\nIf this series of Beret Guy's escapades is taken as a continuous series, it could be entirely possible that [[Hairy]] in this comic is actually Connr Clark from [[1032: Networking]], perhaps implying that either his own company (Eusocial Media Ventures) has fallen to ruin, or he has simply left his position as {{w|chief technology officer}}. Of course, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] has yet to confirm such, but [[Randall Munroe#Absence from explain xkcd|he also believes in death of the author]], leaving this up to ''massive'' interpretation.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Beret Guy's Business]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Job interviews]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]"
