Consequences for flouting these instructions are typically trivial (e.g. perhaps the form may not be processed correctly). However, Cueball's disregard for the rules prompts the preparations for an armed response by some sort of law enforcement or private security organization, presenting a serious consequence for Cueball.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Douglas Hofstadter}}, an author associated with the philosophical concept of self-reference. \"This space intentionally left blank\" is \"Hofstadterially confusing\" because if a space on a form contains the words \"This space intentionally left blank\", then the space is not, in fact, left blank. In sufficiently pedantic organizations the phrase has been modified to some variation of \"this space intentionally left mostly blank\". \n\nDouglas Hofstadter is also the subject of the comic [[917: Hofstadter]].\n\nA similarly harsh consequence for a trivial misdemeanor can be seen in both [[292: goto]] and [[499: Scantron]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[There is a sheet of paper, with a series of check boxes.
