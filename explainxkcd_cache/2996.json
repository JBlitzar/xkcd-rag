Such treaties, and other more casual associations between nations, can be based upon some close association in geographical, political, cultural and/or economic terms (or even, in some cases, by little more than sharing a common opposition to a ''different'' {{w|Trade bloc|bloc}} of nations).\n\nThe \"CIDABM\" group, named for the very specific membership criteria, has been formed on a rather more abstract basis than most geographically-focused groupings (e.g. {{w|NATO}} or the {{w|Pacific Islands Forum}}) and (currently) consists of four otherwise disparate islands:\n*{{w|Sicily}} is an autonomous region of {{w|Italy}}, which is on the south eastern edge of the {{w|Eurasia}}n mainland.\n*{{w|Sri Lanka}} is a nation in its own right, south of {{w|India}}, which is on the southern edge of the Eurasian mainland.\n*{{w|Hainan}} is a province of {{w|China}}, which is on the south eastern edge of the Eurasian mainland.\n*{{w|Tasmania}} is a state of the nation of {{w|Australia}}, south of the eastern side of {{w|Australia (continent)|continental Australia}} mainland.\n\nThese four islands 'dangle below' their mainlands only because of the convention of having north at the top of maps. If the mapmaking convention had instead been to have south at the top, the islands might have been described as floating above their continents. Conversely, {{w|Madagascar}}, {{w|Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland}} or {{w|Adelaide Island}} might have been applicable members of similar 'dangling' alliances where the basic premise might come from one or other different map orientations.  \n\nThe big island of Tierra del Fuego ({{w|Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego}}), mentioned in the title text, is off the southern tip of the {{w|Chile}}an mainland (as well as a small bit of {{w|Argentina}}). Unlike the others in the comic, it doesn't prominently 'dangle' south of a mainland: it has narrow channels separating its northern and northwestern sides from the mainland, and other parts of the {{w|Tierra del Fuego}} archipelago surround its southwestern side and make it appear well-connected to the mainland. In addition, it isn't a single political entity: the island is split between Chile to the west and Argentina to the east. The 'heated debate' mentioned in the title text may be a play on ''Tierra del Fuego'' being Spanish for ''Land of Fire''.\n\nWhile the banner on stage depicts each of the islands with approximately the same size, Tasmania (68,400 km²) and Sri Lanka (65,600 km²) are much larger than Hainan (35,200 km²) and Sicily (25,800 km²). Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego is in the middle sizewise (48,000 km²). \n\nHere is a list of island that clearly do not belong to this club:\n*{{w|Corsica}} (8,700 km², south of France's mainland) but clearly not dangling beneath the tip of a land mass like Sicily but on the side of Italy.\n*{{w|Cyprus}} (9,300 km², south of Turkey) but also to the west of Syria thus not dangling beneath a land mass.\n*{{w|Kyushu}} (36,800 km²) and {{w|Shikoku}} (18,800 km²) that are very close and south of the Japanese mainland of Honshu but this is an island state so island beneath island kind of makes no sense here.\n*The same problem with {{w|Stewart Island}}/Rakiura (1,746 km²), which dangles south of the South Island of New Zealand again an island state so island beneath island kind of makes no sense here.\n*The {{w|Isle of Wight}} (merely 380 km²) is not really beneath the UK as part of the mainland goes more to the south and again an island state so island beneath island kind of makes no sense here.\n*{{w|Gotland}} (3,200 km²) and {{w|Long Island}} (3,600 km²) are even smaller and, like {{w|Taiwan}} (36,200 km²), are not even close to being south of their respective mainlands. \n*{{w|Cuba}} (105,800 km²) which \"dangles\" south of Florida seems to also not quite fit the theme as it is much larger and longer than the part that is \"dangles\" beneath and thus would not be considered dangling from Florida, rather supporting Florida. \n*{{w|Sumatra}} (482,300 km²), is not dangling south of the Malay peninsula as it goes much higher up and is also much larger than the part of the mainland it should dangle beneath so makes no sense to look as it as dangling.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A banner hangs at the top of the frame with a large acronym written above four map segments.
