Sudden shifts in the positions of tectonic plates relative to each other is a major cause of earthquakes, especially the largest ones. {{w|anchor bolt|Anchor bolts}} are used to secure an item in place, for instance to attach a building to its foundation.  In earthquake prone areas, anchor bolts are often used to secure furniture so it won't slide or jump around during a tremor, potentially creating a hazard. The joke is that, instead of settling for an engineering solution that minimizes the <em>consequences</em> of an earthquake, geophysicists have applied the solution to <em>prevent</em> earthquakes from happening. The caption facetiously expresses frustration that the geophysicists have taken <em>this long</em> to address the earthquake problem at its source. The simple absurdity  of this project is another part of the joke.\n\n{{w|Subduction}} is a geologic process in which two {{w|Plate tectonics|plates}} of planetary {{w|lithosphere}} converge, and one is dragged under the other.  The Earth's lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates. They slowly move across the surface at a few centimeters per year, although the rate is nonuniform across plates. Where they collide, the denser plate gets dragged under the less dense plate, in a process called subduction. {{w|Earthquake|Earthquakes}} are common at subduction zones, and subduction can also lead to volcanic activity. An \"anti-subduction anchor bolt\" would aim to stop the process of subduction and the movement of plate tectonics as a whole.\n\nA round head bolt is screwed in through both the oceanic lithosphere and the continental crust from the bottom up, with a plain washer on either side, and a wing nut tightened at the surface. Washers are present to prevent the bolt and the wing nut from sinking into the crust, by distributing the forces over larger areas. There are several concerns not addressed in the comic with such a design. The implication that the bolt is being screwed in from the mantle side would imply that a very large bolt head was operated from inside the mantle. (There are types of nut-and-bolt system that might be easier to deploy, such as {{w|toggle bolt}}s and {{w|Molly (fastener)|mollys}}. These would have the bolt head on the Earth's surface, rather than in the mantle, and use a spreading \"nut\" inside the Earth. They wouldn't require conducting enormous operations from below, \"merely\" a large hole bored from above.) As of the time of posting of the comic, {{w|Kola Superdeep Borehole|humans have not drilled a hole through a continental crust}}, still less deployed large vehicles in the mantle. In addition, the presence of wing nuts, fasteners that are designed to be able to be screwed in by hand, implies work done by a larger being that has appendages able to use the wing nut. The bolt itself would be a technological challenge, as well. It would need to be made to withstand the temperature of Earth's mantle, around 1000&deg;C near the surface.  At these temperatures, most commercial stainless steel used to manufacture bolts would experience noticeable strength losses. The bolt would need be around 50 km long. Moreover, as subduction zones move parallel to each other, the construction would have to withstand high shear forces, something that a bolt is rather unsuited to compared to other tools, such as rivets. On top of that, ways to alleviate stress must be sought out as if the bolt fails, it could produce a highly amplified earthquake. On top of all this, having secured the bolt, the mantle team would have sealed off their most obvious route of exit back to the surface.\n\nIn the short term, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are typically bad for those living nearby, and thus ways to prevent them happening might reduce economic risks in those areas. However, volcanic eruptions deposit nutrients in the surrounding area, enriching soils.  Volcanos also release gases. The vents mentioned in the title text might replenish the nutrients and gases, replacing the benefits of eruptions. Earthquakes sometimes trigger {{w|tsunami|tsunamis}}, which create or modify beaches, and redistribute nutrients from bays and estuaries across coastal plains. So, while the immediate effects of eruptions and earthquakes can be disruptive, they also enrich the environment. Areas at risk from these \"disasters\" are also attractive and enriched as a result of these same events.\n\nWhen plates collide but do not subduct, they often uplift, thickening or raising the crust. The {{w|Himalayas|Himalaya}} mountains, are an example. Tectonic plates spread apart as new lithosphere is formed at ridges, most of which occur under oceans. If spreading continued, but subduction was prevented by the system of anchors pictured in this cartoon, there would likely be new areas of uplift. If positioned appropriately, the mantle ducts, mentioned in the title text, might slow or stop the spreading, reducing uplift.\n\nThe title text references the {{w|Carbonateâ€“silicate cycle|carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle}}. Briefly, subduction and subsequent heating of the global crust restores carbon dioxide and silicate rocks to the planetary surface, countering the effects of carbonate deposition and silicate rock weathering. Anchor bolts sufficient to stop plate tectonics would also stop the carbonate-silicate cycle, leading to unexpected, and likely unwelcome, changes in the surface geosphere and biosphere. (Arguably, if the carbonate cycle alone could be paused, it might be a means of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the biosphere.) To restore the cycle by an unknown mechanism, \"mantle ducts\" have been installed as part of the planet-wide plate anchoring system. It is stated that the mantle duct installation was the most expensive part of the project, implying greater intellectual and technical challenges than the already-massive ones associated with anchor-bolt design and deployment. It is unclear how these mantle ducts would operate in a way that does not replicate many of the issues that the anchor bolts were intended to solve.\n\nThis project would presumably render [[Beret Guy]]'s [[1388: Subduction License|subduction license]] worthless.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Panel shows Randall's usual illustration of a subduction zone: a tectonic plate subducting from the left side of the panel with water above it, and a mountain range forming on the right side of the panel on the other tectonic plate. Beneath each tectonic plate is the asthenosphere. The main difference between this image and others like it is that there is a bolt shown attaching the plates together in the subduction zone. The head of the bolt is shown in the asthenosphere below the subducting plate. There are two washers displayed, one between the bolt head and the subducting plate and one above the other above the upper plate on the side of a smaller mountain. A wing nut is positioned above this washer, with part of the bolt sticking out above the nut, higher than the tallest mountains in the panel]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Good news: Geophysicists are '''''finally''''' installing Earth's required anti-subduction anchor bolts.\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/0/00/20250419063115%21anchor_screws_2x.png original version of the comic], the caption said \"anti-subduction anchor '''screws'''\" instead of \"anti-subduction anchor '''bolts'''\". The title of the comic was also changed, from \"Anchor Screws\" to \"Anchor Bolts\". The original comic image and title can be seen on an [https://web.archive.org/web/20250419024242/https://xkcd.com/3078/ archived version] of the [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] site. The fastener illustrated is indeed a {{w|Bolt (fastener)|bolt}} (with a {{w|Wingnut (hardware)|wing nut}}), not a screw. A screw has a pointed end and is drilled into a hole that is smaller than the diameter of the screw; the pressure caused by its {{w|screw thread|thread}} and screw head binds two objects together. A screw does not need a nut to go with it.\n\nA bolt has a flat end, and it goes into a hole that is larger than the diameter of the bolt; it needs a nut which, when fixed onto the bolt and tightened, together with the head creates the pressure that binds the two objects together. Because a nut is used to create pressure, \"bolt\" is a more correct term than \"screw\", although it is very common to talk of 'screws' for [[1474: Screws|screw-headed]] bolts which attach panels (with non-threaded holes) against a substrate which incorporates a 'nut-like' threaded hole within it (or a nut encapsulated and held non-rotating in the backing plate's recess), even though they are also flat-faced at the thread-end and not self-tapping.\n\nOr, for a differently worded definition, {{w|Screw#Differentiation between bolt and screw|see here}}.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Subduction]]\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
