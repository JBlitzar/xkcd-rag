Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n[[Randall]]'s then-fiancée, now wife was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010. This is a matter he has discussed in the comic [[:Category:Cancer|multiple times before]], with Randall being depicted as Cueball and his wife as Megan. At this comic's release, it had been 15 years since her diagnosis and treatments.\n\nThis comic continues previous comics in the [[:Category:X Years|the series]] – [[1141: Two Years]], [[1928: Seven Years]], and [[2386: Ten Years]] – the initial parts of which are shown in the first 20 panels, which are grayed-out.\n\nThe first of the new panels shows Randall and his wife in bed, with Randall reading her {{w|Tove Jansson}}'s ''{{w|Moominland Midwinter}}''. He wants to stop because they need to get to sleep, she convinces him to read one more chapter. It didn't take much arm-twisting, her argument was simply a grunt.\n\nThe next panel appears to depict the {{w|Covid-19 pandemic}}. [[Hairy]], Megan, Cueball, [[Ponytail]], and [[White Hat]] are all wearing masks and looking at cellphone graphs showing the progression of the virus. Happily, they both survived this.\n\nThe next panel shows them feeding birds. It's apparently winter, since Randall is wearing a knit cap and they're both wearing scarves. There are three birds around Randall, including one perched on his head; there's one bird that has landed on Megan's phone. Randall concludes that the birds like his birdseed more than hers. Megan can't figure out how to take a picture of her bird, since the phone's camera can't be pointed at the phone itself.\n\nThe next panel shows them on a kayaking expedition in a pond or river surrounded by cattails and a dense forest. They're kayaking past lily pads and turtles, with clear skies and birds above.\n\nThe next panel shows Randall in a bed, recovering from appendicitis. He has previously mentioned getting an appendectomy in [[2508: Circumappendiceal Somectomy]], in August, 2021. His wife is enjoying the shoe being on the other foot, going overboard taking care of him after a major medical procedure, but Randall tries to downplay the severity of his procedure.\n\nThe next four panels show them driving. They notice something, pull over, and get out of the car. The panel after this shows them viewing a spectacular {{w|aurora borealis}}. 2025 has been a {{w|solar maximum}}, producing a number of auroras that have been visible at unusually low latitudes, including Massachusetts, where Randall lives. \n\nThe final four panels show them sitting and talking in a field. Randall is lying down, his wife is sitting against a tree. They're celebrating her being cancer-free 15 years after her diagnosis. They do notice some other conditions, and realize they're the natural results of aging. This is good news, considering the serious medical scares they lived through.\n\nThe title text continues that ending with a play on a common conversation topic. Normally someone rhetorically asks \"Want to feel old?\" and then follows it with a description of a difference the conversants have with the younger generation, or how long it's been since some significant event they both experienced, as Randall has done in [[:Category:Comics to make one feel old|several previous comics]]. But in this case, the question is taken literally, with a simple \"Yes\" response to indicate that feeling old is better than being dead and they are happy to be alive.\n\nThe finality of this new installment suggests that it may be the last in the series, as it is solely related to Randall's wife's recovery from cancer.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n'''From [[1141: Two Years]]'''\n:[Randall (drawn as Cueball) and Randall's fiancée (drawn as Megan) sit on a bed, Randall's fiancée is talking on the phone.
