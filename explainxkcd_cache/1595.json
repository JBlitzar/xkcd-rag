[[Cueball]] is reciting the mnemonic trying to figure out how many days October has. This comic was released during the last week of October (the 26th) where it becomes increasingly relevant to know if there are 30 or 31 days in the month. However, he seems unable to concentrate on reciting the poem correctly, keeping track of which months the poem has named and keeping in mind the specific month he was interested in, so by the time he finishes the poem he is unsure whether October was in the list of 30-day months or not. So he starts over again with the same result every single time, as can be seen from the caption below the frame. It seems he also get stuck in all the other months disregarding if it is one of the month mentioned in the mnemonic.\n\nThere are numerous versions of the mnemonic, some of which rhyme better, but this version is one of the more common ones. The {{w|knuckle mnemonic}} is an unrelated alternative.\n\nIn the caption, [[Randall]] states that this happens to him every month. It's assumed that, after a number of iterations with the poem, he eventually remembers the months correctly and figures out the number of days in the current month, which he then remembers until the month changes and forces him to resort to the mnemonic again.\n\nThe title text is a parody of {{w|life hacking}}, and suggests just looking up on one's computer's calendar how many days there are in each month, with the punchline disguised by over-explaining the process of the \"cool mental calculation hack\" (even though there's nothing even remotely resembling a mental calculation in checking a calendar). Alongside the comic, the joke is that the mnemonic is supposed to be the real \"cool mental calculation hack\" which supposedly saves a lot of effort. This is similar to [[1567: Kitchen Tips]].\n\nIt may also be considered amusing that Cueball is unsure whether there are 31 days in October, seeing as Halloween is a largely celebrated holiday on the 31st.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is thinking.]\n:Cueball: Thirty days hath September, April, June and November\n:Cueball: All the rest have 31â€”except February, which has 28, and leap year makes it 29.\n:Cueball: Wait, which month was I listening for? Oh right, October.\n:Cueball: Did I say \"October\" in there? Now I can't remember.\n:Cueball: 30 days hath September...\n\n:I get stuck in this loop every month.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Calendar]]"
