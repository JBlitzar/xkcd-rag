The chances of a random object being a scone are about one in six.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] and [[Beret Guy]] are on a mission, intending to destroy whatever machine they are in, except that Beret Guy tends to be a bit surreal and brought a bag for holding pastries instead of explosive charges.\n\nThis is not the first time he's made such a bakery mistake; see [[434: xkcd Goes to the Airport]].\n\nHe then attempts to eat what Cueball identifies as {{w|lug nut|lug nuts}}, believing them to be scones. In reality, lug nuts do not look very similar to scones.{{Citation needed}} He bites into them and it hurts him, but as he says, maybe some of them are not lug nuts, and he wishes to test them all. (One of Beret Guy's strange powers seems to be superhuman jaw strength: the crunching sound implies he is biting down on steel lug nuts hard enough to crack them apart)\n\nThe title text further emphasizes Beret Guy's obsession with bakery goods, by stating that if a random object is selected, there will be a 1/6 chance that it is a scone, which explains his behavior with the lug nuts. This is, of course, a ridiculous assertion, as if it were true, more than 16% of all things in the universe would have to be scones. (However, Beret Guy's obsession with bakeries and the fact that he doesn't realise he's not in a bakery could make this statement justified from his perspective.) Given Beret Guy's powers, he may have just made this true.\n\nBeret Guy and scones are also referenced in the title text of both [[677: Asshole]] and [[1030: Keyed]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy and Cueball are rappelling down separate ropes into the interior workings of a large machine.]\n:Cueball: Okay, we're in the belly of the machine. You got the charges?\n:Beret Guy: The what?\n\n:[The two are standing next to some large pieces of machinery.]\n:Cueball [gesturing]: The explosive charges!\n:Beret Guy [pulling out a bag]: I just brought this bag for pastries.\n:Cueball: The hell? We're on a mission here!\n\n:Beret Guy [looking around]: This isn't a bakery?\n:Cueball [head in hand]: Oh, Christ, not this shit again.\n\n:Beret Guy [crouching by some lug nuts lying on a piece of machinery]: What about these scones?\n:Cueball: Those are lug nuts.\n:Beret Guy [stuffing them in his mouth]: ...Maybe SOME of them aren't. ''crunch'' Ow! ''crunch''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
