This, and the title text are saying that the likelihood that out of all the possibilities in the universe, the chances that the one single place you would most want to be is just sitting with your significant other is fairly low.\n\nThe title text is Megan's comment to Cueball, where she asks him if he is serious, when there are like a thousand species of Dinosaurs he could be riding (or running from). \n\nPreviously, in [[15: Just Alerting You]], a person rode on a {{w|Brontosaurus}} which at the time of release of this comic was thought to just be an outdated name for {{w|Apatosauruses}}. This was made clear a few comics earlier in [[636: Brontosaurus]]. Apatosauruses are also mentioned in [[460: Paleontology]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is sitting on a couch with Cueball lying in her lap, his feet going out over the armrest.]\n:Cueball: There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you here right now.\n\n:[Zoom in on Megan, still showing Cueball's head in her lap.]\n\n:[Further zoom in on Megan, so only most of Cueball's head can be seen. The couch is only partly sketched, and behind her three thought bubbles lead to a day dream she is having, where we see she is imagining herself riding an apatosaurus, holding the reins going into the dinosaurs mouth.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Apatosaurus]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]"
