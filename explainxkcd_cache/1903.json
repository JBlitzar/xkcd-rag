The governor is confused, then finally comes to grasp that Beret Guy is talking about {{w|rabbit}}s, lots of which can be seen if he would just go outside (by the way, there is a ''small'' one '''RIGHT NOW'''!).\n\nElections in the United States often have a blank spot on the ballot for the voter to write the name of a {{w|write-in candidate}}. Beret Guy thinks he works for the governor because he wrote his name in on the ballot. This does not mean that he actually works for the governor.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe governor finally takes appropriate action by calling security, and Beret Guy confronts his fate with poise and honor. Indeed, the readiness with which he accepts his removal almost seems to suggest that he doesn't belong, which would be an unusual level of awareness for his character. Alternatively, Beret Guy might have misinterpreted the governor's request for security as a question of whether he works in security, or simply ignorance.\n\nBeret Guy's uncertain position in the government is very similar to the way he treats and operates his business. \n\n\"Buns\" have been mentioned previously in [[1682: Bun]] and [[1871: Bun Alert]].\n\nIt is likely that Beret Guy is using the aforementioned Bun Alert app to measure the rabbit population. If this is the case, the recent increase in alerts may simply represent an increase in people using the app, rather than an actual increase in the rabbit population - a common fallacy. One simple way of correcting for this is to divide the total alerts by the number of active users during each interval; a change in this value would indicate that the bun population is actually changing.\n\nIn countries where rabbits are an invasive species or crop-destroying pests, an increase in rabbit populations may be of concern. In the title text, however, experts characterize the ecological impact of a large number of bunnies as \"adorable\" instead of giving information on how the rabbits are affecting the environment.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy holds a stick and points at a board next to him. The board contains a picture of a rabbit, a data point graph, and other notes.]\n:Beret Guy: Good morning, Governor. Our tracking systems show a rapid increase in the number of buns around the Capitol.\n\n:[Hairy is sitting at an office desk and facing Beret Guy in a frameless panel.]\n:Hairy: Buns?\n:Beret Guy: Yes; there's been a long-term upward trend, but it has accelerated recently.\n:Hairy: The trend in... rabbits.\n:Beret Guy: Yes.\n\n:[Beret Guy takes out his phone.]\n:Hairy: So... so what?\n:Beret Guy: So if you want to see some buns, there are lots of them outside!\n:[Beret Guy's phone vibrates]\n:Phone: ''beep!''\n:Beret Guy: Ooh!\n:Beret Guy: There's a small one right now!\n\n:[Zoom-in on Beret Guy.]\n:Hairy (offscreen): Do you... actually ''work'' for me?\n:Beret Guy: Almost certainly. We had an election, right? I wrote my name in on the thing.\n:Hairy (offscreen): Security?\n:Beret Guy: It's been an honor to serve.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Buns]]\n[[Category:Beret Guy's Business]]"
