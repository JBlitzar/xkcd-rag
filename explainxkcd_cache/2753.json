For example, when using a {{w|heat pump}}, if the interior temperature drops below a preset lower limit, then the heating function would be activated.  If the interior temperature rises above another preset upper limit, the cooling function would be activated. This kind of ranged function is common with humidifier/dehumidifier units as well, to create a comfortable condition not too dry nor too damp for comfort.  By specifying upper and lower limits for the operation of the device in question, minor variations of the controlled value will not cause the device to rapidly turn on and off, even working against itself, improving efficiency and reducing unnecessary wear and tear on the device and the building contents.\n\nDevices that manage temperature and humidity are often installed in buildings to improve occupant comfort.  Beyond that, the listed qualities become increasingly problematic and even dangerous.\n\nChanging the pressure of the air could lead to <s>unintended</s> effects like large winds blowing through any cracks in the building.\n\nThe air handler also attempts to force the parameters of dust, smoke, odours, and number of bees into an \"ideal\" range. However, as opposed to being in a certain range, most people who live indoors prefer that these be minimised.{{citation needed}} It's also worth noting that \"a normal amount\" of bees varies widely depending on the situation. A typical honeybee colony contains [https://www.science.org.au/curious/earth-environment/honeybee-hive 60,000 to 80,000 bees], and a typical {{w|Swarming_(honey_bee)|swarm}} (bees looking to establish a new hive) is anywhere from [https://www.bee-commerce.com/content/freedownloads/FactsAboutSwarms.pdf 1,500 to 30,000]. To pollinate an acre of fruiting trees typically requires a minimum of [https://treefruit.wsu.edu/orchard-management/pollination/honey-bees/ 20,000 bees], or approximately five bees per square meter.\n\nIt is not particularly usual to directly monitor the number of bees in an air-stream (usually, insect-screens are the main way to filter out any pesky creatures that might find themselves likely to be caught up in that way), and one might imagine that the upper limit ''should'' be zero, for use indoors in standard living/working spaces, but it might be technically feasible to accurately count bees (with or without distinguishing from wasps and other flying insects) and be able to allow ''some''. But, unlike temperature or humidity, it would be rare (outside of a location used for agriculture) to have a non-zero ''minimum'' desirable quantity of bees. Even more so to then be directly equipped to upwardly correct the current value. The comic ends with Megan asking what the minimum value for bees is, and Black Hat giving an unhelpful but ominous answer that seems to confirm the \"minimum number\" of bees is ''not zero'', with his machine priming itself to release bees to get from below that minimum (it seems to have at least one trapped inside it ready to be released, judging by the buzzing sound). Even after any 'lack of' bees is dealt with, it's implied the machine can also generate smoke, dust and odours â€“ something one would typically not miss if lacking.{{citation needed}}\n\nAs the title text elaborates, the machine analyses and adjusts the ''freshness'' of the air. A smart system in charge of odour-control (by spraying smell-suppressing chemicals and/or more desirable and dominant scents) could be made less wasteful by only trying to ''freshen'' the air when it detects enough necessity. But, of course, this machine also has an opposing limit. And, when the air is considered ''too'' fresh, it has a way of ''adding'' staleness/stinkiness to meet expectations with dirty laundry.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat is standing to the right of an \"air handler\", talking to Cueball and Megan on the left side, probably presenting the sales pitch for the air handler in between them.]\n:Black Hat: Our device monitors your home's air and keeps every variable between a lower and upper limit.\n\n:[Zoom in on Black Hat]\n:Black Hat: Temperature, humidity, pressure, dust, smoke, odors, number of bees...\n\n:[Zoom out similar to Frame #1]\n:Megan: Wait.\n:Megan: What's the '''''lower''''' limit for \"number of bees\"?\n:Black Hat: A normal amount.\n:Air Handler: ''Bzzzzzz''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Bees]]"
