The first, a simple equation for the area of a circle, the second an equation for the area of a triangle with a semi-elliptic base, the third an equation for the area of a rectangle with an elliptical base and top, and the fourth an equation for the area of a hexagon consisting of two opposing right-angled corners and two parallel diagonal lines connecting their sides. In each case, only the area formed by the outline of each shape is calculated.\n\nSimilar illustrations are commonly found in geometry textbooks, which are used to depict three-dimensional figures on a two-dimensional page. They commonly make use of slanted lines to indicate edges receding into the distance and dashed lines to indicate an edge occluded by nearer parts of the solid. The joke is that the formulae given here are for the area of each two-dimensional shape within its outer solid lines, not for the surface area or volume of the illustrated 3D object (as would be shown in the geometry textbook). The title text continues the joke by claiming that the dotted lines are simply decorative.\n\nThe illustrations depict the following plane or solid figures, depending on the interpretation.\n\n; Top Left - Circle with an inscribed ellipse, or Sphere\nThis illustration is commonly used to depict a three-dimensional sphere, with the ellipse representing a \"horizontal\" or axial cross-section through the center; the solid lower half of the ellipse represents the \"front\" of the circumference of this cross-section, while the dotted upper half represents the \"back\" of the same section, which would be occluded from view if this were a solid shape.\n\nThe radius of the circle, from the center to the right edge where it meets the ellipse, is labeled 'r'. In a textbook diagram of a sphere, the radius might be instead labeled with a diagonal line from the center to a different point on the ellipse, implying the generality that all points on that cross-section, and indeed on the whole spherical surface, are at the same radius from the center. However, this line would be shorter on the page than the actual radius, making it useless for the formula of the area of the 2D outer shape.\n\nThe area of the 2D shape on the page is the area of the circle, which is A = πr<sup>2</sup>.  This is captioned below the figure. \n\nCoincidentally the area of the horizontal cross-section of the 3D sphere, as depicted by the ellipse, is also πr<sup>2</sup>, and a reader familiar with such diagrams might initially assume that this is what was meant.  However, this does not extend to the other figures.  \n\nThe 3D sphere commonly depicted by this drawing would have a volume of <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;πr<sup>3</sup> and a surface area of 4πr<sup>2</sup>.  \n\n; Top Right - Ellipse with symmetrical diagonal lines, or Cone\nThis illustration is commonly used to depict a three-dimensional right circular cone, with the lower half of the ellipse representing the \"front edge\" of the bottom surface, and the upper half representing the occluded \"back edge\".  However such drawings would usually not use both 'a' and 'b' to describe the radius of the base of the cone, which is drawn as an ellipse due to foreshortening.  Alternatively, the drawing could depict a right elliptical cone.\n\nRandall approximates the area of the 2D shape on the page as the sum of the area of the triangle formed by the major axis of the ellipse and the two lines, and half of the area of the ellipse (<sup>π</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;ab) since most of the upper half of the ellipse overlaps the triangle.  The equation for this area is A = 1/2 πab + bh.  This is captioned below the figure.\n\nThe actual area of a picture of a cone is not Randall's approximation, because the sides connect at the points on the ellipse where they can spread widest and form tangents to the ellipse, and such points are a little higher than those which define the major axis. This is most obvious in cases when h is only a little larger than a. The area can be computed to be exactly A = b (a arccos(-a/h)) + √(h<sup>2</sup>-a<sup>2</sup>)).\n\nThe 3D right circular cone commonly depicted by this drawing would have a volume of πr<sup>2</sup>h/3 where r=a=b.  The area of the \"lower\" surface would be πr<sup>2</sup>, while the surface area of the upper conical surface would be πr√(h<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup>).  Neither of these areas can correspond with the caption in the comic, nor does the total surface area (the sum of these two).\n\nIf we do not assume that a = b, this drawing could also depict a right elliptic cone.  The volume of the elliptic cone would be <sup>π</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;abh.  The area of the lower surface would be πab and the area of the curved upper surface would be <br>2a√(b<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;h<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;<sub>0</sub>∫<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;√(<sup>a²h²(t²-1)&nbsp;-&nbsp;b²(a²+h²t²)</sup>/<sub>a²(t²-1)(b²+h²)</sub>)&nbsp;dt. \n\n; Bottom Left - Two ellipses joined vertically, or Cylinder\nThis illustration is commonly used to depict a 3D cylinder or right circular prism.  In this case, the upper ellipse represents the \"visible\" part of the top circular surface, with its \"depth\" shorter than its \"width\" due to foreshortening, and the lower part of the lower ellipse represents the \"front\" edge of the lower surface; the dotted half of the lower ellipse represents the occluded \"back\" edge of the lower surface.  \n\nTo add to the confusion, the upper ellipse has its major axis labeled 'd' which usually denotes the diameter of a circular surface, while the lower ellipse has its semiminor axis labeled 'r' which similarly denotes a radius, even though the ellipses drawn have neither diameter nor radius.  The 'h' denoting height is also used for both rectangles and solid objects.  While 'd' in this case is required for the area calculation of the 2D shape, in textbooks only 'r' may be marked and the arrow may be offset at a diagonal rather than in line with any figurative axis, to imply its applicability to any angle of radius.\n\nThe non-overlapping parts of the 2D shape are composed of the rectangle formed by the major axes of the two ellipses and the vertical lines, plus half of the top ellipse and half of the bottom ellipse.  The area of the rectangle is dh, and the area of an ellipse with semimajor axis d/2 and semiminor axis r is πrd/2.  The total area is A = d(πr/2 + h), which is captioned below the figure.\n\nA 3D right circular prism (cylinder) would have a volume of πr<sup>2</sup>h and a surface area of 2πr<sup>2</sup> + πdh, or 2πr(r + h) since in this case d = 2r.  The area of each flat surface would be πr<sup>2</sup>.  If we do not assume d = 2r, then the lateral surface area of the right elliptic cylinder is 4h&nbsp;<sub>0</sub>∫<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;√(<sup>1&nbsp;-&nbsp;t²(1-4r²/d²)</sup>/<sub>1&nbsp;-&nbsp;t²</sub>)&nbsp;dt. The volume is <sup>π</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;rdh. \n\n; Bottom Right - Parallel Hexagon, or Prism\nThis illustration is commonly used to depict a rectangular prism, with 'b' denoting the 'breadth', 'd' the 'depth' and 'h' the 'height'.  However, the labeled angle θ, which is necessary for the area calculation of the 2D shape, would not normally be used in a diagram of a rectangular prism, as all angles are assumed to be right angles.  A rhomboidal prism could be accurately described by this diagram with the assumption that the 'base' parallelogram is perpendicular to the 'front' and that the only non-right angle is θ.  In that case 'd' would not accurately describe the depth of the solid, which would be d sin θ.\n\nThe area of the 2D shape comprises the rectangle at the lower left, the parallelogram above it, and the parallelogram on the right.  The area of the rectangle representing the front face of the prism is bh. The area of the upper parallelogram is db&nbsp;sin&nbsp;θ. The area of the right parallelogram is dh&nbsp;cos&nbsp;θ.  The equation for this area is  A = bh + d(b sinθ + h cosθ) as is given below the figure. \n\nThe surface area of the prism would be 2bh&nbsp;+&nbsp;2db sin θ&nbsp;+&nbsp;2dh. The volume is bdh sin θ. Assuming a 3D shape, θ can be artificially altered by the projection; the assumption could be made that θ is 90 degrees, and sin θ is 1 (and therefore can be eliminated from the formulas), but since θ is marked, such an assumption might not be valid.\n\nIn the history of the development of computer-generated 3D graphics, calculations of the apparent visual area taken up by the projection of a volume may have been useful in occlusion-like optimizations, where each drawn pixel may be passed through many fragment shaders.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Four figures in two rows of two, each being a common two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object, with solid lines in front and dotted lines behind.

The upper edge of the bottom ellipse above the major axis is drawn with a dotted line, while the lower edge is drawn with a solid line, similar to textbook depictions of a right elliptical prism or, more commonly, a right cylinder (circular prism). Inside the shape, the major axis of the upper ellipse is drawn as a double-ended arrow and labeled 'd'.
