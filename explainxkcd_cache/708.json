[roll]... wow, do you ever take it.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Sex dice}} consist of two dice, one listing various actions, and one listing various body parts ([https://i.imgur.com/2ryEaPV.jpg sometimes] a third specifying a manner in which the action should be done). Roll the dice, do the specified action to the specified body part, repeat as necessary.\n\nBecause most games require the same dice, in many peoples' game collections, the dice get mixed around between games. Unfortunately it seems [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] have accidentally exchanged one of their sex dice (the one that contains actions) with a normal six-sided die; as a result, the people playing a {{w|role-playing game}} in the last panel find themselves doing unusual actions.\n\nGiven the situation, it's likely the player who fondled the guard was supposed to roll 2 or 3 six-sided dice to determine the damage of his attack. The sex die came up as \"fondle,\" while the other dice added up to six; hence, he fondled the guard for 6 damage.\n\nThe title text is another possible situation that might arise: \"rolling for {{w|Initiative (role-playing games)|initiative}}\" in role-playing games is how the players determine who attacks in what order during combat. Here, the player rolled the sex die as part of his initiative roll, and therefore \"took initiative\" in an entirely different way. \n\nTypically the missing sex dice will show different actions like these: Blow, bite, nip, lick, pat or suck (from a set that did not include fondle). The other dice with places on the body like breasts might also have these options: Ass, thigh, ear, navel or lips. Other dice may show positions to use, like doggy style, or places in the house on which to perform these, as in the kitchen. It is a little difficult to imagine any of the actions mentioned above resulting in the response in the title text: ''Wow, do you ever take it.''

Behind Megan is a pillow and the bed poles.]\n:Cueball: All right, baby. Get ready for...\n:''Shake shake shake roll''\n\n:[There is no frame around the next drawing of the two dice that have been rolled. The first is a regular five (seen almost from the top, but the sides with one and three can be seen). The second die has text written on it:]\n:Breasts\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are bent over the dice lying on the bed staring at them.

Hairbun is sitting and Ponytail also lying on her stomach, hands beneath her chin. They are sitting/lying down around a game board. On the board is what appears to be two dice.]\n:Guy lying: I... ''fondle'' the castle guard? That doesn't seem right.\n:Hairbun: It did 6 damage, though.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Board games]]"
