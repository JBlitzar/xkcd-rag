The series is composed of four comics, released between in November 2010 and August 2011. They are listed here for convenience:\n*[[819: Five-Minute Comics: Part 1]]\n*[[820: Five-Minute Comics: Part 2]]\n*[[821: Five-Minute Comics: Part 3]]\n*[[Five-Minute Comics: Part 4]]\n\nThe caption above the comic explains the circumstances which led to this series' release. Here are the explanations for each of the small comics and the title text:\n\n; Comic #1\n\n: The first comic pokes fun at improbable conspiracy theories. {{w|Dealey Plaza#Grassy knoll|The grassy knoll}} is a location famous among conspiracy theorists who believe it to be the location of an unknown accomplice in the {{w|assassination of John F. Kennedy}}. It turns out that, somehow, this will all lead up to a theory that perfectly explains the {{w|September 11 attacks}}.\n\n; Comic #2\n\n: When a woman described as having a \"glow\" about them, it's usually just a vague sentiment of attractiveness, specifically during pregnancy, which here very suddenly reaches its conclusion as a baby is unceremoniously plopped into the world.\n\n; Comic #3\n\n: \"{{w|Cogito ergo sum}}\" is philosophical statement in Latin, formulated by {{w|René Descartes}}, translated as \"I think, therefore I am\". Descartes wanted to build a philosophy from scratch, starting with something he could be absolutely certain of. \"Cogito ergo cogito\", is Latin for \"I think, therefore I think.\" This can even beat \"cogito ergo sum\" in uncontroversiality; it is a {{w|tautology}}, which is why the off-screen character describes it as \"playing it safe.\"\n\n; Comic #4\n\n: The comic on the far right is a reference to {{w|trick or treating}}, a major part of the modern {{w|Halloween}} holiday.  Children go from door to door saying, \"Trick or treat?\".  The ''trick'' is a non-serious threat to play a trick on the person if no treat is provided (but see also {{w|Mischief Night}}).   Normally, the person at the home then gives them candy (a ''treat'') as a response. Here, a Megan-like character, possible [[Danish]], is the one playing the trick, visiting nightmares upon small children by gifting them blood. The feat of turning things into blood has been previously mentioned in [[812: Glass]].\n\n; Comic #5\n\n: To bail out of a plane means to escape the plane, usually via the {{w|Ejection seat|cockpit's eject mechanism}}. To bail out a boat means to manually drain water coming onto the ship with buckets. The pilots here have confused the two, although if a plane was somehow taking on a large amount of water, bailing out that water would be a reasonable course of action.\n\n; Comic #6\n\n: Sometimes, TV shows will tell true stories while playing up the drama angle for ratings purposes. In these cases, they will often air a notice similar to \"The following program is a dramatization of real events\" before the show, to indicate that the story they're about to tell is true, albeit not as a literally accurate retelling of events. Here, the disclaimer is technically true, although the events are normally devoid of any drama whatsoever. To add some, Cueball is screaming.\n\n; Comic #7\n\n: {{w|Black light}}s are a kind of lamp that filters out sub-violet light. This means that the only light it gives off is a small amount of violet light, plus plenty of ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light is invisible to humans, but it is noticeable in a few ways; it hurts the eyes, which is why it's hard to focus on things under a black light; it causes sunburns, although the amount given off by a black light is far too insignificant to do this in a realistic time; and it causes a fluorescence reaction in semen, urine, some food stains, and dust making them appear to glow, which is why the robes look dirty. As such, a \"{{w|Lightsaber|blacklightsaber}}\" would, indeed, be a bad idea. It also causes a fluorescent reaction in clothes washed with common washing detergents (which contain brightening agents [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/optical-brightener Optical Brighteners]) - most notably white cotton, which is why it has been used in discothèques, because of the way people in white T-shirts will light up. Interestingly, there is a \"Black Lightsaber\" in Star Wars canon; a unique, one-of-a-kind weapon known as the [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darksaber Darksaber].\n\n; Comic #8\n\n: Most judicial systems have a {{w|jury}}, a panel of impartial laypeople that, primarily, determines the guilt or innocence of a suspected criminal. \"Ladies and gentlemen\" is a formal way of addressing a crowd, and so Cueball addresses the jury as \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury\". However, it turns out the jury consists only of women, so the \"gentlemen\" part is not needed. This poses a problem to Cueball's defense, which apparently relied on somewhat sexist tactics. This, sadly, is not too uncommon in real life.{{cn}}\n\n; Comic #9\n\n: The commander's first line is a line from ''{{w|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope}}''. In the original film, the commander was cut off by {{w|Darth Vader}} using {{w|Force_(Star_Wars)|the Force}} to strangle him, delivering the rebuttal \"I find your lack of faith disturbing.\" Instead of belief in the Force as in the movie, the \"ancient religion\" referred to here is actually {{w|Wicca}}, a modern pagan religion with two deities that is most notable for practicing magic, and is related to {{w|voodoo}}. So, naturally, Darth Vader puts a hex on the commander's family. (Although, to modify a quote from the Internet, Wiccans hexing you as punishment is like a hippie threatening to punch you in your aura.)\n\n; Title text\n\n: The title text notes that modern Wiccans don't really practice the whole \"putting hexes on people\" thing, which is true. Episcopalianism probably refers to the {{w|Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church of the United States}}, which was founded during the American Revolution to replace the Church of England in the colonies.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends.
