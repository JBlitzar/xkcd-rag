We realize the allusion to Gmail by the first continuation, \"Try reloading Gmail if the problem persists\".\n\nIn the second continuation, \"Maybe we should just go to bed\", the opening instead refers to a person suffering from {{w|Sexual dysfunction|sexual performance anxiety}}, taking \"longer than usual\" to achieve either {{w|orgasm}} or {{w|erection}}, probably despite considerable efforts of their partner. Often such frustration then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that renders orgasm/erection virtually impossible by ruining the mood. In such situations it is likely that one or the other partner becomes frustrated and gives up, suggesting \"let's go to bed\" instead of 'pointlessly' continuing the sexual activity.\n\nThe title text ties both interpretations together by referencing an infamous [http://www.howtogeek.com/135351/how-to-troubleshoot-mozilla-firefox-crashes/ error message] given by the {{w|Firefox|Firefox internet browser}}. As an error message, it fits nicely with the Gmail interpretation of the comic, though it is equally likely to be used as an apology or frustrated slight in the sexual interpretation. It would be a likely next line after \"this is taking longer than usual\". Alternatively, it would be embarrassing to get the two responses confused, thus necessitating a flowchart as a guide.\n\nIt could also simply be a jab to people who stay online late even when doing nothing, as when a lag occurs, and finally realising it might be better to switch off the computer and go to bed; or people who stay up late obsessed that \"[[386|Someone is wrong on the internet]]\".\n\nThis is not the first time [[Randall]] juxtaposes sex and more abstract topics, such as sex and math in [[487: Numerical Sex Positions]] or sex and engineering in [[592: Drama]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A flowchart with one starting bubble at the top. Two arrows goes left and right below this bobble to two other bobbles.]\n:Top: \"This seems to be taking longer than usual-\"\n\n:Left: \"-Try reloading Gmail if the problem persists.\"\n\n:Right: \"-Maybe we should just go to bed.\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Flowcharts]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"
