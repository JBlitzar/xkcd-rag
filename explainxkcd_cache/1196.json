In reality, none of these systems are interconnected, but in the diagram subways from different cities that have the same color on the official subway map have whimsically named connections, such as the \"Ohio-California Tunnel\" connecting the Green Lines of Cleveland and Los Angeles, or the \"Rocky Mountain Tunnel\" connecting the Blue Lines of Chicago and San Francisco. Vancouver and San Francisco are connected through a station called Richmond, which appears to double as {{w|Richmond, British Columbia}} and {{w|Richmond, California}}. The \"Springfield Monorail\" is fictional, from the animated series ''{{w|The Simpsons}}'' (see {{w|Marge vs. the Monorail}}), but its approximate location on this map would suggest the [http://www.seattlemonorail.com/ Seattle Monorail], or perhaps Springfield, Oregon, which [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Matt-Groening-Reveals-the-Location-of-the-Real-Springfield.html Matt Groening revealed was the inspiration for the  Simpsons' hometown].\n\nThe [http://www.radicalcartography.net/subways.html Urban Mass Transit Systems of North America] map (right) created by [http://hshm.yale.edu/rankin Yale Professor Bill Rankin] on his website [http://www.radicalcartography.net/ Radical Cartography] in 2006 presents all of the subway systems in North America at the same scale using geographic, instead of topological, layout. The networks on xkcd's map are displayed with absolutely no consideration to geographic position, in order to connect like-colored routes together. While {{w|Vancouver}} is the most North-West, {{w|Mexico City}} being the most South, and San Francisco the most west, distances are not accurate (in reality, Vancouver is closer to Chicago than to Toronto for example) and cities are often arranged in the wrong direction from one another:\n\n* San Francisco is shown directly west of Toronto - in reality west southwest \n* Boston is shown directly north of New York City and just slightly to the west - in reality east northeast\n* Atlanta is shown west southwest of Miami - it is actually north northwest\n* Atlanta is shown northwest of Mexico City - it is actually northeast\n* Atlanta is shown slightly east of being south of Los Angeles - it is actually just slightly north of being directly east\n\nThe map's design is modeled after the system map of the {{w|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}} in Boston where Randall is from.\n\n===City-specific notes===\n\n===={{w|SkyTrain_(Vancouver)|Vancouver}}====\n*The {{w|Canada Line}} and the {{w|Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line}} are shown as the same color; SkyTrain's official maps depict them with light blue and dark blue respectively.\n*{{w|Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond}}, B.C., is the name of the city where the southernmost terminus of the Canada Line is located, and shares its name with {{w|Richmond, California}} (see San Francisco section).\n\n===={{w|MBTA subway|Boston}}====\n*The \"Green Line Extension to Canada\" references {{w|Green Line Extension|the actual project}} to extend the {{w|Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line}} into Medford, north of Boston, which was completed in 2022.\n*The \"Ashmont–Manhattan High-Speed Line\" shown as connecting Boston's Red Line to New York City's 1 train is a play on the {{w|Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line}} in Boston.\n*The renamed {{w|Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line}} stops {{w|Quincy Center station|Skinflower}} and {{w|Quincy Adams station|Bonevine}} are plays on the actual name of the Red Line's terminus, {{w|Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree}}.\n*The {{w|Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line}} terminates at {{w|Forest Hills station (MBTA)|Forest Hills}} in {{w|Jamaica Plain}}. It is connected to New York's IND Concourse Line, but unfortunately despite its ambiguous appearance on the map this does not actually through-run to the IND Queens Boulevard Line with its {{w|Forest Hills-71st Avenue station|Forest Hills}} and {{w|Jamaica–179th Street station|Jamaica}} stations.\n\n====San Francisco====\n*Both {{w|Muni Metro|Muni}} and {{w|Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART}} are depicted in San Francisco's map and are completely separate systems, although the map gives the impression that trains interline between the two.  Non-wheelchair-accessible stops on Muni lines are omitted.\n*{{w|Richmond, California|Richmond}} is the name of the city where the northern terminus of the {{w|Richmond-Fremont line|Richmond–Fremont}} and the {{w|Richmond-Daly City/Millbrae line|Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae}} BART lines are located, and shares its name with {{w|Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond, British Columbia}} (see Vancouver section).\n*\"Sunnydale\" is the {{w|Sunnydale Station|actual name}} of the terminus of the Muni {{w|T Third Street}} line, not to be confused with {{w|Sunnydale|the city}} where ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is set, nor the very real city of {{w|Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale}}, located approximately at the location shown, some 40 miles Southeast of San Francisco.\n\n===={{w|Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles}}====\n*The {{w|Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Gold Line}} and the {{w|Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Orange Line}} are shown with swapped colors.\n*The Orange Line is the only {{w|bus rapid transit}} (BRT) line to be shown on the map. LA Metro also operates a second BRT line, the {{w|Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Silver Line}}, which is not shown.\n\n====New York City====\n*The {{w|New York City Subway}}, {{w|Port Authority Trans-Hudson}} (PATH), and the single line of the {{w|Staten Island Railway}} (with a connection via the {{w|Staten Island Ferry}}) are shown.\n*{{w|Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica}} is the name of the neighborhood in Queens where the E, F, and J/Z trains terminate. Kingston is the capital and largest city in the country of {{w|Jamaica}}.\n*The actual {{w|G (New York City Subway service)|G train}} is notorious for unreliable service, hence the \"Random Service\" notation.\n*The \"Robert Moses High-Speed Line\" refers to the NYC urban planner {{w|Robert Moses}}, who was one of the most influential planners in supporting cars over all public transport, creating the car-dependent {{w|New York metropolitan area}}.\n\n====Philadelphia====\n*Both {{w|SEPTA}} subway lines, a portion of the {{w|SEPTA Subway–Surface Trolley Lines}}, and the {{w|PATCO Speedline}} are shown.\n*\"Trolley Rt. 10 to California\" is a play on the actual {{w|SEPTA Route 10|Route 10}} trolley.\n\n===={{w|Washington Metro|Washington, DC}}====\n*The \"Graveyard for passengers killed by closing doors\" refers to the warning played in the Washington DC Metro system advising passengers that the subway doors are \"not like elevator doors\" and will close on your limbs or belongings rather than opening when contact with an object is detected.\n*The \"Morgantown, WV Automated Line\" references the {{w|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}} system, which was built in 1975 as a {{w|personal rapid transit}} demonstrator and serves the three campuses of West Virginia University.\n*{{w|Greenbelt (WMATA station)|Greenbelt}} is the northern terminus of the Washington Metro's Green and Yellow lines, hence the Green line being depicted as forming a belt.\n*This comic was made before the Silver line was constructed, so it does not appear in the comic.\n\n===={{w|Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Miami}}====\n*The \"Caribbean Metromover\" references the {{w|Miami Metromover}}, a people mover in downtown Miami (not shown on the map.)\n*The airport logo for Miami International Airport (MIA) is replaced with a paper airplane.\n\n===={{w|Tren Urbano|San Juan}}====\n*The \"Puerto Rico Submarine\" that connects the Red Lines of San Juan and New York refers to the fact that San Juan is on an island, namely {{w|Puerto Rico}}. It is a pun on the Staten Island Ferry, which also has New York at one end, the idea being that there could be a different, comically unlikely sea-faring vessel travelling to Puerto Rico.\n*The \"Mona Tunnel\" that connects the Red Lines of San Juan and Santo Domingo may refer to the island of {{w|Isla de Mona|Mona}}, which lies between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.\n\n===={{w|Metrorrey|Monterrey}}====\n*The \"Chicxulub Tunnel\" that connects the Red Lines of Santo Domingo and Monterey refers to the 65-million-year-old {{w|Chicxulub crater}}, which lies roughly between the two cities.\n\n===Official subway maps===\n*Atlanta - http://www.itsmarta.com/rail-schedules-or-route.aspx\n*Baltimore (MTA Maryland) - http://mta.maryland.gov/sites/default/files/metro-subway.jpg\n*Boston (MBTA) - http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/\n*Chicago (CTA) - http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/maps/P19_2012_CTA_Rail_Map.pdf\n*Cleveland - http://www.riderta.com/pdf/maps/System_Map_Rapid_Connect.pdf\n*Los Angeles (LACMTA) - http://www.metro.net/riding_metro/maps/images/rail_map.gif\n*Mexico City - http://www.metro.df.gob.mx/imagenes/red/redinternet.pdf\n*Montreal - http://www.stm.info/english/metro/images/plan-metro.jpg\n*New York City (MTA) - http://www.mta.info/maps/submap.html\n*New York City (PATH) - http://www.panynj.gov/path/maps.html\n*Philadelphia (SEPTA and PATCO) - http://www.septa.org/maps/system/index.html\n*San Francisco (BART) - http://www.bart.gov/images/global/system-map.gif\n*San Francisco (MUNI) - https://www.sfmta.com/maps/muni-metro-map\n*Toronto (TTC) - https://www.tourbytransit.com/toronto/public-transit/subway\n*Vancouver - http://mapa-metro.com/mapas/Vancouver/mapa-metro-vancouver.png\n*Washington (WMATA) - http://wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm\n\n===Missing cities===\nNot all cities with a subway are shown on the map.
