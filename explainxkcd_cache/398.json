However, throughout the comic, Cueball uses the phrase ambiguously.\n\nIn the first panel, it is possible that [[Cueball]] is using \"tap that ass\" sexually. However, it is more likely that he is using \"tap\" to mean \"pick\" or \"choose,\" in which case he would be the one choosing the next committee chair. \"That ass\" refers to one of the individuals in the meeting room to be picked for the position.\n\nIn the second panel, \"tap\" is referring to wiretapping. The Cueball character with the headphones on has just unplugged his headphone. This suggests that he and his colleague at the phone were just done with the wiretapping. In this scenario, it is strange that the colleague is still on the phone instead of hanging up. However, it would be much stranger to wiretap someone in plain eyesight, unless that person is blind. \"Ass\" likely refers to the person they have just wiretapped. Cueball says he'd tap that ass \"without a warrant,\" suggesting that they had one in this situation.\n\nIn the third panel, \"tap\" is referring to extracting sap from trees. A sexual connotation would make no sense in this context. \"That ass\" refers to the maple tree.\n\nThe final panel reveals that Cueball was purposefully implying the sexual meaning of \"tap that ass\" all along, even though he framed it in a non-sexual context. He reaffirms his previous statement from the third panel by turning toward the direction of the third panel (thus implicitly breaking the fourth wall) and asserting \"I'd have sex with that tree.\" \"That tree\" refers to the tree from the previous panel.\nAlternatively, Cueball may have finally realized that he indeed wanted to have sex, but instead of using the euphemism \"tap that ass,\" he says it literally.\n\nThe title text features a request from Cueball from the last panel to Cueball from the third panel. He asks Cueball not to plug up the hole left behind from tapping the tree, so he can have sex with it.\n\nIn [[xkcd: volume 0]], below the comic is a bonus comic, replete with horrible puns:\n[[File:398 bonus comic.jpeg|500px|center]]\n(\"Wood\" also meaning \"erection\" and \"son of a {{w|beech}}\" sounding like \"son of a bitch\".)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball in a hallway looking in on a board meeting.]\n:Cueball: I'd tap that ass to be the new committee chair.\n\n:[Cueball wearing headphones with a briefcase and a laptop.
