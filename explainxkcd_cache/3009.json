Even quantifying how many numbers are left uses up some of those numbers when stating the results.\n\n\nIn real life, being able to write or say digits is not a limited resource.{{cn}} However, the comic does parallel many {{w|Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot|educational video games}} for young children where numbers and mathematical concepts are treated as living people or factory goods, in order to give some sort of story or context to the math-related activities. In addition, the plight faced by the shortage resembles the {{w|look-and-say sequence}} where trying to quantify the list changes it, requiring it to be quantified again (which changes it again, and so on).\n\nThe comic conflates numbers with decimal digits. So when [[Blondie]] says \"15 2s and 12 3s\", that uses up two 2s (one in \"2s\" and one in \"12\") and one 3 (in \"3s\"). She adjusts the counts as she's speaking, so when she says \"13 2s\", that uses up another 3, leaving only 10 3s as she's completing the sentence.\n\nIn the title text, she uses the last two 0s when saying that they had two 0s left, so now they have no more 0s. But she can't use the number 0 to describe this situation because they're now out of them.\n\nBlondie could have taken a different approach by saying \"14 2s and 11 3s\", which would be accurate once it has been said.\n\nJokes with a similar theme been made about letters, such as shortages of vowels (and later consonants) in {{w|The Onion}}'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20020124120633/www.theonion.com/onion2816/vowels2816.html \"Clinton Deploys Vowels to Bosnia\"]. A similar joke where numbers were treated as a limited resource appeared in [[2956: Number Line Branch]].\n\n===Continuation===\n\nA continuation of the pattern would go:\n\n* \"We have only 15 2s and 12 3s left.\"\n* \"No, wait, 13 2s and 10 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 12 2s and 9 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 10 2s and 8 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 9 2s and 7 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 8 2s and 6 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 7 2s and 5 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 6 2s and 4 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 5 2s and 3 3s.\"\n* \"No, wait, 4 2s and 1 3.\"\n* \"No, wait...\"\n* \"How many more do we have?\"\n* \"I ... don't know!!\"\n\nAt that point, having used up the last 3 at the end of the previous line, Blondie would lack the necessary 3s to articulate that there are \"3 2s and 0 3s.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Blondie is standing on the left, facing Cueball and Megan on the right.]\n:Blondie: The Math Department number shortage is getting worse. We have only 15 2s and 12 3s left.\n:Blondie: No, wait, 13 2s and 10 3s.\n:Blondie: No, wait...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Blondie]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]] <!-- The plural \"s\"es. -->"
