However, although Newton had begun working on calculus before Leibniz, he didn't publish it, and Leibniz was the first to publish it (see the {{w|Leibnizâ€“Newton calculus controversy}}).\n\nIn calculus a {{w|derivative}} is the result of mathematical differentiation: the instantaneous rate of change of a function relative to its argument, and denoted df(x)/dx. As taught in schools, if a function is drawn as a graph, the derivative of that function at a given point is equal to the slope of that graph at that point. However, the literary word derivative [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/derivative means] developed from something older or copied/adapted from others, as Newton claims is the case here.\n\nThe pun is that Newton is claiming that Leibniz's mathematical derivative is a derivative, or descendant, from his earlier development of this calculus.\n\nThe comic as a whole is mocking the pattern of corny one-liners that {{w|David Caruso}} often spurts out during the opening scenes of {{w|CSI: Miami}}. The one liner is followed by him dramatically pulling off or [[:Category:Puts on sunglasses |putting on his sunglasses]] and then the show breaks into the title sequence which starts with Roger Daltrey singing an extended \"YEEEEAAAAAAAH\", from the song {{w|Won't Get Fooled Again}} by {{w|The Who}} as noted in the title text. This has become a [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/csi-4-pane-comics popular Internet meme] and was used frequently with {{w|Death of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's death}}. The sunglasses joke was also used in the title text of [[977: Map Projections]]. The counts of each letter (Y E A H) in the scream are 1, 6, 6, and 6, which combined produce the year in which Newton is credited to have discovered calculus.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Newton with long white hair, facing right, holds up a sheet of paper, with several lines indicating the writing on it, in one hand and the other hand is also held up. He stands in front of an empty desk. A smaller frame breaking the border at the top of the frame has a caption:]\n:Newton, 1666\n:Newton: I've invented calculus!\n\n:[Leibniz with long black hair, facing left, holds up a sheet of paper, with several lines indicating the writing on it, in one hand. He stands in front of a desk with a book and two pieces of paper, one lying below the other paper but up above the book. A smaller frame breaking the border at the top of the frame has a caption:]\n:Leibniz, 1674\n:Leibniz: I've invented calculus!\n\n:[Back to a similar image of Newton, but he has now taken his arms down, still holding his paper.]\n:Newton: Really? Sounds a little bit...\n\n:[Zoom in on Newton as he puts on a pair of sunglasses in a panel without a frame. The table is not included.]\n\n:[Newton now with sunglasses on, again in front of the table.]\n:Newton: ...'''''Derivative.'''''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Analysis]]\n[[Category:Puts on sunglasses]]\n[[Category:Puns]]\n[[Category:Math]]"
