It is slightly less than one-thousandth of sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth (a standard atmosphere is 1013.25 millibar).\n\nThe millibarn is a metric unit of area, equal to a thousandth of a {{w|Barn (unit)|barn}} (a humorously-named unit approximately equal to the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus), or 10^-31 m^2 or 10^-27 cm^2. Both units would theoretically have the symbol '''mb'''. Hence '''mbmb''' (the pressure unit multiplied by the area unit) would be a unit of force. This can be seen by applying dimensional analysis; pressure x area = (force/area) x area = force.  Nobody in the comic strip discusses the magnitude of this force, but it would be 100 Pa x 10^-31 m^2 = 10^-29 newtons = 10^-24 dynes, or about the weight of an electron under Earth's gravity.\n\n'''am''' would be the symbol of an {{w|Atto-|atto}}meter, or 10^-18 meters. Multiply that to create the unit '''mbmbam''', which would be a unit of energy. Specifically, it would be a unit of work: the energy expended to move an object. More dimensional analysis: force x distance = (work/distance) x distance = work. The actual value of 1 mbmbam is correctly calculated in the comic: 100 Pa x 10^-31 m^2 x 10^-18 m = 10^-47 joules = 10^-40 erg. White Hat dubs this unit \"one podcast\".\n\nThe final panel is an extended series of puns: 'rise' referring to physically moving upward as well as biologically growing (expanding and becoming lighter and softer) as yeasts do; 'foam' referring to both {{w|quantum foam}} (the fluctuation of spacetime on very small scales due to quantum mechanics) as well as the foam generated by yeast fermenting; 'unleavened dimensions' punning on the eleven dimensions of spacetime in {{w|string theory}} (actually, ten—{{w|M theory}} says eleven), while continuing to play on the theme of yeast--in this case, the universe is presumably flat because some of its dimensions lack the Planck yeast that would make them rise. White Hat appears to have managed to have caught onto these puns, much to his (extreme) dissatisfaction.\n\nThe example used in the comic of lifting a yeast cell 1 Planck length is one of many possible examples of 1 mbmbam of work. (The {{w|Planck length}}, approximately 1.6×10^−35 m or 1.6×10^−33 cm, is how far light travels in one unit of {{w|Planck time}}.) Another interpretation of 1 mbmbam would be the work necessary to pull two socially distancing (6 ft) SARS-CoV-2 {{w|Virus|virions}} apart by the thickness of a single strand of hair against the gravity they exert on each other.\n\nThe Planck Era (or {{w|Planck_units#Cosmology|Planck Epoch}}) referenced in the title text is the near infinitesimally short period covering the first 10^-43 s after the Big Bang, when energies were so high that the four fundamental forces were combined into one and ordinary subatomic particles didn't yet exist. It is unlikely there were advice shows during this era{{Citation needed}}, so this would likely be a modern nostalgia show for physicists. The title text is also a play on My Brother, My Brother and Me's tagline: ''An advice show for the modren [sic] era.''\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball, Megan, and White Hat are standing next to each other, talking. Megan has her hands raised to the side, in a shrugging gesture.]\n:Megan: Odd how in physics \"'''mb'''\" is both millibars (pressure) and millibar'''n'''s (area).\n:Megan: '''mbmb''' could mean millibar-millibarn, which is a unit of force, strangely.\n:White Hat: Units are weird.\n\n:[Same scene - Megan is now checking her phone. White Hat is raising his right index finger.]\n:Cueball: So what's '''mbmbam''', the My-Brother-My-Brother-And Me unit?\n:Megan: Millibar-milliibarn-attometer, I guess? That'd be a unit of energy. 10<sup>-47</sup> Joules.\n:White Hat: \"One podcast\"\n\n:[Same scene in a frameless panel. Megan holds her phone to her side. White Hat has his arms raised to the side, excited.]\n:Cueball: 10<sup>-47</sup> sounds small.\n:Megan: Yeah, it's roughly the energy you'd need to lift one yeast cell by one Planck length in Earth's gravity. \n:White Hat: Planck yeast!\n\n:[Same scene in a regular panel. Megan has put away her phone, and has her right index finger raised. White Hat has his hands balled into fists, frustrated.]\n:Cueball: Doesn't Planck yeast rise on its own?\n:Megan: Yeah, that's what makes quantum foam. But data suggests our universe is flat.\n:Megan: String theory says it's because spacetime has unleavened dimensions.\n:White Hat: ''...I hate you.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category: Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category: Comics featuring White Hat]]"
