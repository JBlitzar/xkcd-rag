The \"watch it for the ads\" addition was a master stroke.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe third in the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby series]]. The {{w|Super Bowl}} is the championship {{w|American football}} game of the {{w|National Football League}}, which is usually played each February, and the final game of the 2006 season, {{w|Super Bowl XL}}, was played on the evening of 2006-02-05, the day before this comic was released.\n\nAs the game is one of the most watched television broadcasts in North America, {{w|Super Bowl commercials|advertising during the game}} has become increasingly expensive (among the most expensive advertising rates of any broadcast) to the point where corporations produce their best, most expensive advertisements to air during the game, to ensure that they would get value out of the expensive spots. The Super Bowl has thus become notorious for the \"best\" commercials, with some viewers purportedly tuning in solely to see the commercials, rather than the actual football game. News reports the next day often highlight the best and worst Super Bowl commercials, as do websites devoted to Super Bowl commercials.\n\nRealizing that the Super Bowl is viewed by a large percentage of the population, [[Randall]], somewhat tongue-in-cheek, states that those people would be quite distracted during that time, and therefore it would be possible to steal cars without fear of being caught. The title text takes this even further, suggesting that the entire Super Bowl was invented entirely for the purpose of being a distraction for car thieves. Naturally, the addition of the ads would make this even more effective, as it would attract even more viewers and ensure that they stayed in front of the TV during commercial breaks as well as the game.\n\nThe phrase \"I steal cars\" also provides a contrast to the fact that many viewers are only watching for the advertisements, making their smug sense of superiority seem petty compared to the fact that they but not Randall are not stealing cars and that they therefore are morally superior to Randall in this respect. This calls into question whether or not they really are significantly superior by comparing this marginal superiority to not being criminals. Alternatively, Randall may resent these people for feeling superior even though they aren't actually superior (at least in the eyes of Randall) and therefore steal their cars as punishment. Or Randall might be implying that they have no reason to being smug as they are being duped into having their cars stolen, and the thief is the one in the best position to be smug.\n\nRandall may have chosen to use a car as a reference to the large number of car commercials that play during the Super Bowl, in addition to the ease of stealing a car at that time.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A green car with text above and next to it.]\n:My hobby:\n:While everyone is watching the Super Bowl, feeling smugly superior because they're \"Only watching for the ads,\" I steal cars.\n\n==Trivia==\n* This comic has the same title as [[1480: Super Bowl]], released on January 30, 2015. While this is the second time this happens, there have been other instances of [[:Category:Disambiguation pages|comics sharing the same name]]. The first was [[786: Exoplanets]], released on August 30, 2010, and [[1071: Exoplanets]], released on June 20, 2012.\n* In between this comic and the one nine years later, no other comics related to the Super Bowl came out. The year after, in 2016, the comic [[1640: Super Bowl Context]] was the third comic to talk about it.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:American football]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
