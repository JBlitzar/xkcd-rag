However, this ignores light travel times. In fact, a fast-moving butt would appear rotated toward the observer but not substantially distorted. Shakira was right.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n''Gedankedank'' is a humorous {{w|portmanteau}} of ''Gedankenexperiment'' (German for \"{{w|thought experiment}}\") and ''badonkadonk'' (slang term for [http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=badonkadonk an attractive, round butt]).\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] often used thought experiments to explore scientific hypotheses too impractical or impossible to actually perform, in order to examine their consequences. Moving close to the speed of light, '''c''', is nigh-impossible with existing technology; and according to Einstein's theory of {{w|special relativity}} accelerating a mass exactly to '''c''' ''is'' impossible. Einstein is well known not to have cared about his appearance (e.g. {{tvtropes|EinsteinHair|his uncombed hair}}, the tongue photo, etc.) so it is unlikely that he pondered how relativistic velocity would affect the appearance of his butt.{{citation needed}}\n\n{{w|Lorentz contraction}} is a consequence of special relativity, whereby objects contract in the direction of travel. \n\nThe appearance of rotation while moving close to the speed of light is known as {{w|Terrell rotation}}. The title text then connects this rotation to the Shakira song \"{{w|Hips Don't Lie}}\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[We see a head and shoulders view of Einstein. He looks pensive.]\n:[Einstein's \"line\" is in a thought bubble.]\n:Einstein: If I were traveling at the speed of light, my butt would look ''awesome''.\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Einstein was famed for his ''Gedankedank''.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Albert Einstein]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Portmanteau]]"
