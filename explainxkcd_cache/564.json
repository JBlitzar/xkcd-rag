Experimental confirmation of the Higgs mechanism and its signature particle (the {{w|Higgs boson}}) was seen as so important that the boson was dubbed the \"God particle\". Detecting it, however, required accelerating particles to energies higher than ever before. Since this was at the cutting edge of physics, it was unknown what would actually happen. There were [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/05/lhc_to_leave_fabric_of_spacetime_continuum_unripped/ fears] that the experiment would create a micro black hole or worse. This comic could be seen as applying those fears to a common trope in horror movies and video games where a mutant infestation is created by unknowing scientists. The scientists here, apart from poor [[Cueball]], have done their research and armed themselves for any upcoming dangers. It is unknown whether these dangers are specific or not. Some argue that [[:Category:Velociraptors|velociraptors]] are a common enough theme in xkcd that the experimenters are preparing for a velociraptor attack. Others point out that the crossbow is a weapon in the game series ''{{w|Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life}}'', whose plot has a similar infestation following a failed physical experiment ripping dimensional seams. They mention that someone at the particle accelerator closely resembled one of the main characters of ''Half-Life''. Of course, the crossbows may just be a general preparation for danger.\n#Since the experimental confirmation or denial of the Higgs mechanism was widely recognized as important to the development of physics, the experimenters involved were likely to receive Nobel Prizes. Nobel Prizes, however, are only given to living people and groups of up to three in size. The experimenters, therefore, are preparing to fight to the death when the discovery comes. Peter Higgs had [http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/07/us-science-particle-idUSL0765287220080407 made a statement] in 2008 hinting that the confirmation would come within one year, and that statement was made one year before the Tuesday mentioned in the comic. Tentative experimental confirmation of the Higgs boson was made in July 2013.\n#This comic may simply be general sympathy for those late to catch on to something. Substituting different things for \"crossbow\" and \"Higgs excitation\" would give a similar situation for Cueball. [[Randall]] apparently hates these situations. A layer of {{w|metahumor}} could be present here, as Cueball may represent the clueless readers of xkcd who have to go to the [http://forums.xkcd.com/index.php forum] or [[Main Page|this wiki]] to understand its comics.\n#The comic may simply be making a jab at school/university labs used in science classes, which have a reputation of containing strange or confusing equipment that may or may not pertain to the assigned experiments. While the particular nature of the object (a lethal weapon) and the complexity of the supposed topic (the then-unconfirmed Higgs-Boson particle) may be exaggerations, this only adds to the surreality often present in xkcd (as well as the fact that Cueball's peers have a complete understanding of the crossbow's purpose).\n#The other scientists are messing with Cueball.\n\nIn the first and second interpretations, the title text could refer to literally being the slowest in the lab, and therefore the least able to outrun whatever is making everyone carry crossbows.\n\nThe proper interpretation of this comic, or whether there even is one, remains an open question.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is pulling a crossbow out of a desk.]\n:Cueball: Why do you have a crossbow in your desk?\n:Megan (off-screen): You ''don't''?\n\n:[Pan to Megan who looks towards Cueball who is off-screen to the left.]\n:Cueball (off-screen): No—why would—\n:Megan: You ''are'' studying the consequences of Higgs excitation, aren't you?\n:Megan: Like the rest of the lab?\n\n:[Cueball, now carying Megan's crossbow joins her as the panel extends to include another Cueball-like guy to her right, he also carries a crossbow.]\n:Cueball: Yes, but why—\n:Guy: Maybe he's slow with the math.\n:Megan: Well, he has until Tuesday.\n:Guy: Poor guy.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"
