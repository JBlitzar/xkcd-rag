However, as he walks, some grass speaks up to insult him, and Cueball is upset to find that he hasn't escaped the negativity at all. (see [[1749: Mushrooms]] which involves an unusual occurrence of a vocalizing angry mushroom).\n\nThe title text expands on this, with him searching {{w|Google}} for how to \"block the lawn\". Blocking someone refers to a standard setting on websites and online services that can prevent certain users from communicating with you, but it is as yet unknown how this would work for a lawn insulting you. This is made ironic by the fact he is using the Internet to find an Internet technique (blocking) on a non-Internet object, while at the start of the comic, he just wanted to escape the Internet.\n\nThe term \"[https://www.bayeradvanced.com/articles/how-to-tell-if-your-lawn-needs-dethatching blocking]\" is actually used in lawn-care to refer to techniques where sunlight is restricted from reaching the lower parts of the grass stems and to persuade the root system to grow deeper into the soil.\n\nLater in [[1802: Phone]], Cueball cannot go outside for a walk without bringing his phone as he cannot stand to be disconnected from his feed, which is the exact opposite of what he tries in this comic. Although in the title text he does try to disconnect, he then finds that this is also bad because it leads to social isolation.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball walking on grass]\n:Cueball: It's nice to get outside, away from the pain and negativity of the internet,\n\n:[Cueball stops walking]\n:Cueball: And just enjoy the cool breeze and the grass under my feet.\n\n:[Cueball stands there, hands to his hips, looking to the cloudy sky]\n\n:[Cueball looks down while pointing a finger at the grass behind him.]\n:Grass: You ''suuuuck''\n:Cueball: ''Hey!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Google Search]]"
