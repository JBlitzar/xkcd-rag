This is a clue that things are not as they appear.\n\nAs the point-of-view pulls back in each successive frame, we see that \"Megan on a ship\" is really a {{w|Thought bubble#Thought bubbles|thought-bubble}} belonging to [[Cueball]], who is sitting at his desk. He apparently is day-dreaming instead of working. This is presented in the standard, crisp format, as if drawn on a computer. This suggests it shows us our \"normal\" view.\n\nHowever, as the perspective continues to pull back, we see that \"Cueball thinking of Megan\" is actually a thought-bubble belonging to Megan. In the final frames, the ship sails out of frame. However, since the final frames are in the same grainy pencil-drawing format, it suggests that this is still Cueball's thoughts, rather than an actual image of Megan.\n\nThe title text, \"Or so I hope,\" shows us what this {{w|recursion}} really means: Cueball hopes that Megan realizes that he misses her, but suggests he's not entirely certain she does.\n\nBut, the comic can be interpreted in a different manner. \n\n;Alternative explanation\nThe comic starts with Megan on the bow of a ship, but in following panels, it turns out that Cueball (presumably in a relationship with Megan) is thinking about her, sitting afar from her. As we move forward (or downwards) in the comic, it turns out indeed that Megan is thinking that her partner Cueball might be missing her and thinking about her while she is on a voyage, or at least she hopes it to be that way, as the title text suggests. This also explains the title of the comic \"To Be Wanted,\" which Megan expects from Cueball.\n\nBoth of the above explanations could be true without conflict. But as the title text is most often assigned to [[Randall]] himself or to a Cueball character, the \"Or so I hope?\" is most likely written by the guy who drew the comic. This would then indicate that it is Cueball/Randall who wishes to be wanted by Megan - but he also hopes that Megan knows/hopes that he wants her.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands looking out on the bow of a ship.]\n:[Scene backs up.
