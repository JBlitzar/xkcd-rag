It is most used in spy movies or books. In this case, the book is ''Atlas Shrugged'' and instead of a secret passage, the wall swings around and takes you to a message \"You have terrible taste\".\n\n''{{w|Atlas Shrugged}}'' is a {{w|dystopian novel}} by {{w|Ayn Rand}}. [[Randall]] is suggesting it's a bad book.\n\nAlthough the intent behind the book was in Rand's theory of {{w|Objectivism}}, it has become largely adopted as a battle-cry by Libertarians. One could find this as another reason to dislike Rand's literature, as Libertarians have been notoriously disruptive and annoying to many who oppose their political philosophy or their means to get their message across.\n\nThe title text is a general criticism Randall has with Rand, since most of Rand's characters are fiercely independent and rather tactless. Also see [[Ayn Random]].\n\nBut the title text also shows the fact that people reading Rand can easily be swayed and aligned with her beliefs by the fact that it stresses that you are unique and individual, and that Randall was victim of these circumstances until he finds Rand's approach preposterous and rejects it. Oddly, since he seems to be judging Rand this on his own accord and making his own decision, one could theorize that he is truly an individualist in that he is not swayed by anyone, even a person who preaches not to be swayed and to make your own decisions â€” a subject pursued in Ayn Rand's ''{{w|The Fountainhead}}''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands in front of a bookshelf.]\n:Cueball: Ooh, ''Atlas Shrugged''.\n:[Cueball yanks out book only for a click to be heard.]\n:[The entire setup begins to rumble, while the bookcase and a surrounding platform takes both it and Cueball behind the wall.]\n:[The tiny, dark room behind the wall has one thing painted on it.]\n:Wall: You have terrible taste.\n:[The whole piece of kit moves back to its original position. Cueball stands there mildly stunned.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
