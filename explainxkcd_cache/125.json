I wonder if you're safest just buying the most popular one.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Black Hat]] is trying to get a job running a marketing program. [[Cueball]] conducts the interview and says that although he has heard that Black Hat is the best in the business, his portfolio does not show that he has run any major marketing campaigns. Black Hat asks where he heard that rumor and Cueball begins to respond with \"word of mouth.\" This makes him realize that Black Hat's marketing skills are so strong that he built a reputation for himself without ever running a major campaign. Then, Black Hat tries to skip ahead of the interview process and coyly asks, before being offered the job, when he can start working.\n\nA book that becomes the most popular in its field is the one with the best marketing, not necessarily the one with the best content. The title text suggests that in this case, where the subject matter is marketing, the most popular book would in fact be written by those with the best marketing skills, and would therefore contain the best content. However, this fails to realize that the publishers of the book would only be good at marketing themselves, but not necessarily at teaching marketing. Furthermore, it could be that the people authoring those marketing books are incentivized to sell bad advice, since less competition in the field means more opportunities for themselves.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat, standing in front of Cueball, who is sitting behind a executive desk, looking at some papers.]\n:Cueball: I've heard you're one of the best in the marketing business, but I've got your portfolio here and looks like you've never run a major campaign. Why should I hire you to head our new initiative?\n\n:[Same scene.]\n:Black Hat: If you don't mind my asking, what gave you the idea I was one of the best in the business?\n:Cueball: Hm? I don't remember. Just word of mouth or someth-- ...oh, you're good.\n:Black Hat: Thank you. When can I start?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Job interviews]]"
