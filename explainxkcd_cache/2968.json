In a speech, he declares that his goal during those five years has been to make his university overtake the age of the oldest university in his state, which is obviously impossible.{{Citation needed}} The other university was then two years older than his own (215 years vs 213 years old). He states he has funded an intensive program to make the university five years older, or three years older than the rival university was. That would have happened anyway, whatever he had done (short of such gross mismanagement as to cause his university to cease operations), or if he'd done nothing at all.\n\nThe final line of Cueball's speech, \"Unfortunately, I have terrible news\", presumably precedes the announcement that the rival university has also aged 5 years and is therefore just as far ahead as they were before.\n\nUniversities often plan ambitious initiatives to boost prestige. However, true success often depends on factors outside administrative control, such as student quality, alumni achievements, faculty research, historical reputation, and external economic and social factors. While administrative efforts are important for operations and gradual improvements, a university's overall prestige cannot be engineered quickly through planning alone.\n\nIn the title text, Cueball's proposed \"roadmap for the next 10 years\" could mean more of the same ineffective efforts, perhaps merging his university into another institution that was founded before the rival university, or undermining the rival university so it ceases operation, probably by malicious means. A much more unlikely plan could involve placing the rival university in a spacecraft on a near-light speed journey, slowing its apparent age due to relativistic time dilation. Most likely, his plan is to continue doing the same thing as he'd done the last five years but making it sound like a new idea even though nothing will ultimately change.<ref>According to Einstein, this may imply that [[1657: Insanity|Cueball has gone insane]].</ref> This may be part of the joke.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing behind a lectern on a stage. He has raised a finger in the air while addressing an unseen audience.]\n:Cueball: When I took the helm five years ago, our university was 213 years old â€“ the second oldest in the state, just behind our 215 year old rival.\n:Cueball: Under my leadership, we've funded an intensive program to increase our age to 218, overtaking our rival by 3.\n:Cueball: Unfortunately, I have terrible news.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Time]]"
