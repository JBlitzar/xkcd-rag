Strip versions of popular games are a common activity at parties, especially when alcohol is involved. The obligation to remove pieces of clothing is supposed to add an extra zest to the game. A very widespread variant is {{w|Strip Poker}}, followed by strip versions of regular party games like {{w|Truth or Dare}} or {{w|Spin the Bottle}}.\n\nHowever, the comic also suggests playing other games in a way that involves stripping. In reality, playing such games as \"Strip {{w|Tennis}}\" or \"Strip {{w|Agricola (board game)|Agricola}}\" is rather unusual. The Chris Van Allsburg picture book ''{{w|Jumanji (picture book)| Jumanji}}'' and the Robin Williams movie adaptation \n''{{w|Jumanji}}'' are about a magical board game that manifests dangerous creatures and traps from the jungle and lost civilization therein; a theoretical Strip Jumanji would probably not remain very titillating during the chaos (evidently, therefore, \"strip Jumanji\" refers to [https://jumanji.fandom.com/wiki/Jumanji_(Milton_Bradley_Board_Game) the real-life board game based on the movie]). \n\nThe last column features games of which strip versions are (according to Google) nonexistent. While the other columns named sports or board games where a strip variant would be at least conceivable, the last one includes the {{w|zero-player game|zero-player}} {{w|Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life}} and the {{w|Prisoner's_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma|Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma}}, which is a theoretical example in {{w|game theory}}. It is therefore left to the reader to imagine how a strip version of these pseudo-games would appear.\n\n\"Global Thermonuclear War\" in the title text is a reference to the film \"{{w|WarGames}}\", where a young hacker accesses a US military supercomputer and starts a nuclear war simulation, believing it to be only a computer game.  The film ends when the computer is shown that nuclear war is \"a strange game\" in which \"the only winning move is not to play\". The computer then proposes (on its all-caps screen): \"HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF CHESS?\"\n\nStrip global thermonuclear war is a patently absurd idea; while it is a common trope for people to engage in one last moment of intimate pleasure before certain doom, foreplay (including strip games of any type) is a time-consuming practice, and time is something you don't have much of considering that the bomb could drop on your place of residence at any moment. Besides all that, the act of betting on which city is going to go up next in a nuclear inferno tends not to be an effective aphrodisiac for most people.{{Citation needed}} But at least you wouldn't be wearing your radioactive clothes!\n\n==Table of games==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!style=\"width:15%\"|Frequency\n!style=\"width:20%\"|Name\n!Explanation\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Frequent<br>n > 1%\n|{{w|Poker}}\n|Poker, a card game with rounds of betting, is a game with common \"strip\" variations, see {{w|strip poker}}.\n|-\n|{{w|Spin the bottle}}\n|Spin the bottle is a party game where players must kiss a randomly selected other player. As this is a semi-sexual party game, strip varieties are relatively popular.\n|-\n|{{w|Beer pong}}\n|Beer pong is a drinking game common at universities and colleges, occasionally accompanied with stripping for either missing a shot or for the opponent making one.\n|-\n|{{w|Never have I ever}}\n|Never have I ever is a drinking game where players take turns asking other players about things they \"have not done\". A relatively common variation has players remove clothing, rather than put down fingers, if they have done something.\n|-\n|{{w|Truth or Dare}}\n|Truth or dare? is a party game, in which players are given the choice between answering a question truthfully, or performing a dare. A common twist is for players who wish to skip a truth or dare offered to them to remove an article of clothing instead.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Rare<br>1% >= n > 0.01%\n|{{w|Chess}}\n|Chess is a board game between two players. Theoretically, clothing could be removed whenever a piece is captured. \n|-\n|{{w|Blackjack}}\n|Blackjack is a gambling card game, played between players and a dealer, in which players do not play against each other. This makes it harder than poker to create rules for stripping, but it is still feasible.\n|-\n|{{w|Tennis}}\n|Tennis is a racket sport played between 2 players (or between teams of 2, in the case of doubles). As the sport is active and outdoors, there may be hazards associated with stripping during tennis, but it isn't implausible.\n|-\n|{{w|Settlers of Catan}}\n|Settlers of Catan is a strategy board game, where players compete to \"settle\" an island by harvesting resources. Settling on a set of rules to strip to may be difficult, as the points scored in Catan are kept secret until the end.\n|-\n|{{w|Pictionary}}\n|Pictionary is a party board game, involving drawing and guessing words. Enforcing stripping on a missed word is a plausible twist, though not particularly common.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Extremely rare<br>0.01% >= n > 0\n|{{w|Cricket}}\n|Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport, commonly played in the UK, India, and other Commonwealth countries. The laws of cricket (and, given that cricket is an outdoor sport, public obscenity laws) disencourage the players' removal of clothing, though it is far from unknown for {{w|Sheila Nicholls|spectators}} to do so.\n|-\n|{{w|Magic: The Gathering}}\n|Magic: The Gathering is a trading card game, released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. The rules of Magic: The Gathering do not have allowances for stripping built into them, but it is still likely possible for someone to come up with a ruleset.\n|-\n|{{w|Stickball}}\n|Stickball is a game similar to baseball, using a broom handle and a rubber ball. Consequentially, strip stickball likely has the same hazards as strip cricket and strip tennis, though it differs from stick tennis in that agreeing on a set of stripping rules may be difficult.\n|-\n|{{w|Agricola (board game)|Agricola}}\n|Agricola is a farming-inspired strategy board game. Agricola is not a game designed for stripping, though it isn't impossible to figure out a way to accommodate it.\n|-\n|{{w|Jumanji#Games|Jumanji}}\n|''Jumanji'' is a 1995 fantasy film (based on a {{w|Jumanji (picture book)| picture book by Chris Van Allsburg}}) that centers on a supernatural board game. A board game based on the film was released by Milton Bradley. As explained above, Jumanji is not a particularly sexy game, and therefore may not serve as an effective medium for stripping.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Nonexistent<br>n = 0\n|{{w|Poohsticks}}\n|A children's sport mentioned in the {{w|Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh books}} played by dropping sticks into a river and watching them reappear on the other side of a bridge. Despite the kid-friendly origins, and unlike the other games below it, a \"strip\" version of Poohsticks is actually viable.\n|-\n|[[wikia:w:c:starwars:Podracing|Podracing]]\n|Podracing appears in the {{w|Star Wars}} films as a racing competition held with hovering vehicles. How a \"strip\" version would work between two racers is unclear, but a determined set of spectators \"wagering\" their clothes on the races could probably hammer out a system.\n|-\n|{{w|Prisoner's_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma|Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma}}\n|The prisoner's dilemma is a \"game\" that is analyzed in game theory, showing why rational individuals may not cooperate, even if it is in their best interest to do so. While the standard version of the game seems to lack any scoring mechanism that could be tied to stripping, the iterated prisoner's dilemma could conceivably having such a mechanism, being repeated over and over.\n|-\n|{{w|Chess by mail}}\n|Could conceivably work if the players include increasingly-nude photographs of themselves in their correspondences. The problem is, a game by e-mail can take days to finish, and a game by {{w|snail-mail}} can take upwards of ''several months''. The titillation factor is far too spread out to satisfy the desires of anyone who would elect to play a game of strip chess in the first place.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n|{{w|Conway's Game of Life}}\n|Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player {{w|cellular automaton}} devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is not a \"game\" in the traditional sense, so \"stripping\" would also be very difficult, if not impossible.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:Frequency of Strip Versions of Various Games\n\n:n = google hits for \"strip <game name>\" / google hits for \"<game name>\"\n:(at the time of this writing)\n\n:Frequent\n:(n > 1%)\n:-Poker\n:-Spin the Bottle\n:-Beer Pong\n:-Never Have I Ever\n:-Truth or Dare\n\n:Rare\n:(1% >= n > 0.01%)\n:-Chess\n:-Blackjack\n:-Tennis\n:-Settlers of Catan\n:-Pictionary\n\n:Extremely Rare\n:(0.01% >= n > 0)\n:-Cricket\n:-Magic: the Gathering\n:-Stickball\n:-Agricola\n:-Jumanji\n\n:Nonexistent\n:(n = 0)\n:-Poohsticks\n:-Podracing\n:-Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\n:-Chess by Mail\n:-Conway's Game of Life\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Sport]]\n[[Category:Chess]]\n[[Category:Nuclear weapons]]\n[[Category:Games]]\n[[Category:Google Search]]"
