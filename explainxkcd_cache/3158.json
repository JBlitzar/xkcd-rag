Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\nThis comic is part of a series on [[:Category:Confusion matrices|confusion matrices]].\n\nVarious hazardous (or merely obnoxious) materials, objects, and effects can have their danger reduced with specialized protective equipment. The yellow squares are where the shield fails to protect against the object. The grey-yellow squares are where the shield is partially successful, but still presents some risk. The grey squares are where the shield succeeds.\n\nThe first five barriers are materials/conditions which may be used to block some things and not others, which makes for a relatively normal comparison matrix. The last five barriers are devices which are deliberately designed and manufactured to block the last five materials/effects.  Comparing those with effects for which they aren't designed is presented for absurdity. \n\nAll but two tiles<!-- sound through water, with fish; heat through vacuum, with ice --> feature [[Cueball]] who tries to make use of that column's chosen 'protective shield', although in the case of some scenarios (involving vacuum or water) he may also be sufficiently equipped against the environment he finds himself in. Also present will be the row's specific 'effect', either in its own right (an object or creature that embodies the phenomenon automatically) or as conveyed by [[Megan]] (when not just present as onlooker) who may also have had the 'shield' primarily delegated to her. The two main exceptions are where Cueball himself emits the sound (from within 'protective' suits that turn out to be ineffectual sound-blockers), to apparently annoy Megan, and depictions of radio reception (which always shows Cueball's attempt to transmit, whether or not it shows a successful incoming message).\n\nSome hazards, such as {{w|alpha particles}}, a form of radiation with particularly low penetrative power, can be easily deterred by common things; even a relatively short distance through air is enough to minimize their impact. Comparatively, more dangerous hazards, such as the far more penetrative {{w|gamma rays}}, are unaffected by all but the shielding methods actually intended for them. No effect is either all effective or all ineffective, against each form of 'shielding', and neither is any instance of shield consistent against all effects.\n\nThe title text notes that, while the shark hazard is shown on the chart to be entirely nullified by a sufficient air barrier, in reality sharks are capable of attacking prey even if it is a short distance out of the water.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"background:#E6C3C3;\"\n!

Lead works because of its density and high atomic number, scattering gamma rays.\n| style=\"background:#D5C58A;\"|Water can be used to shield against gamma rays, but you need at least 10 feet of water between you and the gamma rays for it to work.\n|colspan=7; style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|Gamma rays have the highest energy of any type of light, and has no mass and no charge, making them pass through most materials easily.\n\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Neutrons}}\n| style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|Neutrons are not stopped by low densitiy materials such as air.\n| style=\"background:#D5C58A;\"|Leads high density means that the neutrons will keep bumping into lead nuclei loosing their energy through inelastic scattering. However since the lead nuclei are much heavier than neutrons most of the energy will remain with the neutron, as a result many collisions are needed to slow the neutrons. Some neutrons will also be absorbed by the nuclei although the cross section is rather low.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Since protons an neutrons have almost the same mass, a collision with a hydrogen atom in water will result in the neutron losing almost half of its energy resulting in a very rapid attenuation. Moreover the cross section for the fusion of neutrons and protons is high, leading to most neutrons being captured to form deuterium.\n|colspan=7; style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|None of these materials is dense enough to slow or absorb neutrons in significant quantities.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Alpha particles}}\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n| style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\n|colspan=2; style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|Outside of a vacuum, Alpha particles are only detectable within short distances (millimeter scale), and the presence of the two cages is incidental.

It also makes this a fairly useless set of armor.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|As with the oven mitts, Hairy uses the helmet part of the biohazard suit to block the light source.\n|colspan=2; style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|As both types of cages have holes in them, it is easy for the light to pass through the holes and reach Cueball.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Sound}}\n| style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|\n| style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|\n| style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|\n| style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\"In space, no one can hear you scream\".
