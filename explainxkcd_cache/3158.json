Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\nThis comic is part of a series on [[:Category:Confusion matrices|confusion matrices]].\n\nVarious hazardous (or merely obnoxious) materials, objects, and effects can have their danger reduced with specialized protective equipment. The yellow squares are where the shield fails to protect against the object. The grey-yellow squares are where the shield is partially successful, but still presents some risk. The grey squares are where the shield succeeds.\n\nThe first five barriers are materials/conditions which may be used to block some things and not others, which makes for a relatively normal comparison matrix. The last five barriers are devices which are deliberately designed and manufactured to block the last five materials/effects.  Comparing those with effects for which they aren't designed is presented for absurdity.\n\nThe first three hazards - Gamma Rays, Neutrons, and Alpha Particles - represent different types of radiation. Their associated \"beep\" and \"click\" sounds mirror real detection behavior: \"beep\" corresponds to ionizing radiation like gamma and alpha particles, detected by modern radiation detectors, while \"click\" refers to neutron detection, which uses a separate type of counter designed for neutral particles. {{w|Geiger counter|Geiger counters}}, an earlier form of radiation detector, also clicked.\n\nAll but two tiles<!-- sound through water, with fish; heat through vacuum, with ice --> feature [[Cueball]] trying to make use of that column's chosen 'protective shield', although in the case of some scenarios (involving vacuum or water) he may also be sufficiently equipped against the environment he finds himself in. Also present will be the row's specific 'effect', either in its own right (an object or creature that embodies the phenomenon automatically) or as conveyed by [[Megan]] (when not just present as onlooker) who may also have had the 'shield' primarily delegated to her. The two main exceptions are where Cueball himself emits the sound (from within 'protective' suits that turn out to be ineffectual sound-blockers), to apparently annoy Megan, and depictions of radio reception (which always shows Cueball's attempt to transmit, whether or not it shows a successful incoming message).\n\nSome hazards, such as {{w|alpha particles}}, a form of radiation with particularly low penetrative power, can be easily deterred by common things; even a relatively short distance through air is enough to minimize their impact. Comparatively, more dangerous hazards, such as the far more penetrative {{w|gamma rays}}, are unaffected by all but the shielding methods actually intended for them. No effect is either all effective or all ineffective, against each form of 'shielding', and neither is any instance of shield consistent against all effects.\n\nThe title text notes that, while the shark hazard is shown on the chart to be entirely nullified by a sufficient air barrier, in reality sharks are capable of attacking prey even if it is a short distance out of the water. However, it claims a high \"attenuation coefficient\", which is an {{tvtropes|ExpospeakGag|overly scientific way of saying}} that you don't need a ''lot'' of air between you and the shark before it can't hurt you. Indeed, while sharks can jump out of the water to a certain height, there's a hard line between \"vulnerable\" and \"out of reach\", and a person can be within arm's reach of a shark's attack while they themselves are in no danger whatsoever.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"background:#E6C3C3;\"\n!

Lead works because of its density and high atomic number, scattering gamma rays.\n| style=\"background:#DDDCB2;\"|Water can be used to shield against gamma rays, but you need at least 10 feet of water between you and the gamma rays for it to work.\n|colspan=7; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Gamma rays have the highest energy of any type of light and have no mass or charge, making them pass through most materials easily.\n\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Neutrons}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Neutrons are not stopped by low density materials such as air.\n| style=\"background:#DDDCB2;\"|Lead's high density means that neutrons will keep bumping into lead nuclei, losing their energy through inelastic scattering. However since lead nuclei are much heavier than neutrons, most of the energy will remain with the neutron; as a result, many collisions are needed to slow the neutrons. Some neutrons will also be absorbed by the nuclei, although the {{w|Cross section (physics)|cross section}} is rather low.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Since protons and neutrons have almost the same mass, a collision with a hydrogen atom in water will result in the neutron losing almost half of its energy, resulting in a very rapid attenuation. Moreover the cross section for the fusion of neutrons and protons is high, leading to most neutrons being captured to form deuterium.\n|colspan=7; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|None of these materials are dense enough to slow or absorb neutrons in significant quantities.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Alpha particles}}\n|colspan=4; style=\"background:#C4C5C7\"|As alpha particles are almost completely unable to travel through most materials, any of these would effectively stop them. Even if they didn't, the intervening air and distance to Cueball would prevent them being detected in any case. In the third panel, Cueball questions if his equipment is working, as this is the only thing which isn't detected within the first four shields.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|While alpha particles are unable to travel through air, they can move freely in a vacuum. As such, alpha particles are able to reach Cueball in this scenario, activating his detector and allowing Cueball to know that his equipment is indeed working properly.\n|colspan=3; style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|As with the first four shields, any of these materials would block the particles, and in any case they would have a hard time travelling through air to reach Cueball regardless of the shield provided.\n|colspan=2; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|There are gaps in both the cages through which the particles could pass. In both cases, the emitter has been moved closer to the observer, because otherwise the effect would be masked by the intervening air.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Light}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Light passes easily through air; if it didn't, we would not be able to see.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|As lead is a solid, opaque material, light is not able to pass through it.\n| style=\"background:#DDDCB2;\"|Water is mostly transparent to visible light. It will attenuate over long distances, but won't be quickly blocked.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|As glass is a largely transparent substance, light is usually able to pass through it.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Because a lack of air does not impact the travel of light, it reaches Cueball without issue.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Cueball is able to use the opaque oven mitts to cover the light source, successfully preventing the light from reaching him.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|The helmet Cueball is wearing is opaque, blocking the light from reaching him. It also makes this a fairly useless set of armor.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|As with the oven mitts, Hairy uses the helmet part of the biohazard suit to block the light source.\n|colspan=2; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|As both types of cages have holes in them, it is easy for the light to pass through the holes and reach Cueball.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Sound}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Air is the most common medium through which we perceive sound. It would not serve as an effective barrier between a source of sound and someone's ears, unless it was over a very great distance.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Lead is very dense, and is in fact used for soundproofing due to its resistance to buffeting by airborne sound waves. But, as an extremely dense solid, it is a very fast conductor of vibration within itself (so long as the thickness of the material does not invoke the dampening softness and attenuate those vibrations). In this case, Megan is directly knocking upon the lead screen itself, which seems to be enough for the sound of the knocking to emerge at Cueball's side.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Sound travels significantly faster and further in water than in air, making it difficult to locate and understand, but certainly not doing any good when it comes to ''blocking'' sound. The image in this square is of a dolphin,<sup>&#91;[[285: Wikipedian Protester#top|''cetacean&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup> detecting fish using sound waves, which it is very good at doing precisely ''because'' its sounds travel very well through water.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Glass, while useful for muffling sound, cannot block it entirely, as anyone whose neighbors mow the lawn at 6:00 can attest to.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|\"In space, no one can hear you scream.\" In a vacuum (like space), there are no atoms or molecules to carry sound waves. \n| style=\"background:#DDDCB2;\"|Oven mitts are thick enough that they block some of the sound if a person shouts into them, but it will not be enough to fully block out the sound.\n| colspan=2; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|The two cases of whether sound can penetrate suits are the only two cases where Cueball is trying (successfully) to inflict the phenomenon on [[Megan]], who otherwise features only as the (attempted) instigator.<!-- Though Cueball may actively apply the \"protection\" against Megan's \"issue\". --> Neither suit is able (or intended) to significantly block sound waves.\n| colspan=2; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|The cages are open enough that their ability to block sound is negligible, and standing in one will do very little to block out sound.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Heat}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Air can be a fairly effective thermal insulator when constrained, as in {{w|aerogels}} and many types of insulation. However, freely moving air as depicted in this panel flows as it heats up, transferring heat from the campfire to Cueball's marshmallow. Additionally, air does little to block thermal radiation from the heat source.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Lead conducts heat, allowing Cueball to toast a marshmallow on the surface of the shield.  However, since lead is poisonous, he should not do this.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Heat will raise the temperature of water. If the temperature is raised high enough the water will start to boil; boiling has long been used by humanity to prepare food. Marshmallows however are not meant to be boiled.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Cueball appears to be holding a glass bottle over an open fire, into which he has presumably placed his marshmallows. Depending on the temperature, the type of glass and its thickness, it is possible to heat the contents of a glass container, but if the container is unsuitable this can be dangerous to the user. Also, it is unclear how he proposes to consume the sticky marshmallow mess this would create.\n| style=\"background:#DDDCB2;\"|The lack of matter in a vacuum completely blocks transmission by conduction and convection, the two main ways in which heat is spread. It still allows transmission by radiation, which is less efficient. For the specific example of the thermos shown in the image, the way they are constructed, completely blocks radiation, but there are enough residual air particles for a very slow convection. The fact that the shielding is made from one single (very thin) piece, and it has lips, also allows some conduction.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Cueball is holding a pan over an open fire while wearing oven mitts. Pans whose grip or handle is not made of a material that conducts less heat than the pan proper are dangerous to grab onto with one's bare hands: wearing oven mitts protects the user from heat. It should be noted that, depending on the weight of the pan and the time the pan needs to be held over a fire to prepare its contents, this can be quite tiring for the user.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|A suit of armor is made of metal, which will conduct the heat and do little to protect one's hands against an open flame. The inside of the gloves will be made of some kind of cloth and/or leather, which, as well as giving little protection, might pose a fire hazard.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Bio-hazard suits are designed to help filter air and allow the user to handle dangerous chemicals. However, most bio-hazard suits are made out of fabrics with a laminate coating, both of which are prone to burning and allow heat to pass through.\n| colspan=2; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Both cages have a minimal effect on the heat from a fire. Depending on the intensity of the fire and the distance from the cage this can create a comfortably warm temperature to the person inside of the cage.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Swords}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Air has a negligible force against objects and is unable to stop Megan's sword's thrust.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Lead is a heavy and dense metal, and as a result, it can stop blows from a sword.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|While water has a greater force than air against objects, it is still not enough to stop Megan's attack.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Glass is easily broken by sharp blows, especially if it isn't tempered, and as a result does not stop Megan's sword.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|A vacuum has no resistance against objects and unsurprisingly is not able to stop Megan's attack.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Oven mitts are typically made of fabric, which would provide only limited protection. They also do not cover the full body.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|The metallic armor Cueball is wearing was probably designed to stop penetrating and slashing sword blows, with further layers beneath to dampen impacts.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Swords are sharp, and as such are able to break through the thin hazmat suit Cueball is wearing.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|A Faraday cage can be a fine mesh, optimal to screen out various radio frequencies of EM radiation but not intended to stop anything else and comparatively delicate against any physical penetration.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|A shark cage, while able to provide resistance against larger threats, has holes through which Megan's sword can go.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Particulate matter#Health problems|Toxic dust}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Dust can travel through air, hanging onto small currents. Air does nothing to protect Cueball.\n| style=\"background:#DDDCB2;\"|{{w|Lead poisoning|Lead is poisonous}}, so while a solid lead barrier would prevent toxic dust from passing through, any dust or metal fragments from the shield would still be dangerous.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Water actually can be {{w|Dust abatement|used to prevent the spread of dust}}. However, toxic dust that gets into drinking water will {{w|Water pollution#Groundwater pollution|contaminate it}}, and could cause health problems, just as airborne toxic dust can.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Dust cannot travel through glass, and being fully encased in a glass bell protects one from dust (though it would bring its own problems).\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|With no air to slow it down, dust in space can move at dangerously high speeds, possibly fast enough to tear through Cueball's space suit.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Oven mitts are worn on the hands and do not normally interfere with one's breathing. However, if there is a notable amount of toxic dust in the air, holding an oven mitt over one's face is better than no protection.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|A suit of armor still allows the wearer to breathe, and provides no particular protection from dust.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|A biohazard suit is fully enclosed with its own internal oxygen supply, and so protects the wearer from airborne particles.\n| colspan=2; style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Both cages are too open to provide any significant protection against dust.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Radio}}\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Radio waves are more than able to travel through air. This is what allows walkie-talkies to work.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Because of lead's high density, radio waves are unable to penetrate it, and would not work in Cueball's situation.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Radio waves from two-way radios, like the kind shown in the comic, {{w|Radio propagation#Direct modes (line-of-sight)|cannot penetrate deep water}}. There are {{w|Radio propagation#Surface modes (groundwave)|radio frequencies that ''can'' penetrate deep water}}, but these have a much lower frequency, require more powerful transmitters, and (in the case of {{w|Extremely low frequency#Difficulties of ELF communication|extremely low frequencies}}) cannot transmit audio.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|In a similar way that glass is transparent to visual light, it is also transparent to radio waves, allowing them to pass through.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|As there is nothing getting in the way of radio waves in a vacuum, radios work very well in space. This allows ground control to communicate with astronauts in space.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Oven mitts, typically being made of fabric, have no effect on radio waves.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|A metal suit of armor blocks radio waves. This is because metals are very good electrical conductors, which block the radio waves.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Biohazard suits do not block radio waves, and someone wearing such a suit can send and receive radio transmissions without issue.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|A {{w|Faraday cage}} is specifically designed to block electromagnetic fields such as radio waves. In fact, this is the ''only'' 'hazard' here that it blocks.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|The openings in a shark cage are too wide for the cage to experience the properties of a Faraday cage.\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Sharks}}\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Sharks cannot travel very far on land or in the air.\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Shielding yourself with lead plates will effectively protect you against sharks.\n| style=\"background:#FFF978;\"|Sharks live in water, so water is not an effective shield against sharks.{{cn}}\n| style=\"background:#C4C5C7;\"|Glass will effectively protect you against sharks, provided that it is thick enough.
