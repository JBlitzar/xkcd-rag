This is an illustration of boredom and pointlessness in life. But suddenly the wall in front of her is opening. She considers running for the door, but curiosity overtakes her. She enters the hole, closes it behind her, and with that, she enters a different world. The hole appears as if it is a rip in a sheet of paper, implying that since they are drawings (which they are),{{cn}} this would be essentially a hole in space-time from their perspective. Most people would run away from such a thing, but Megan seems to feel that since she is currently bored (shown by the fact that she is constantly refreshing her E-mail), this is a break from her normal life, and she may not fully be realizing/acknowledging the inherent dangers of leaving her realm into an unknown universe.\n\nIn the title text, she worries that she is missing an email, though, much as a person often does resist breaking from routine.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. These are all the comics in [[:Category:Choices|Choices series]]:\n* [[264: Choices: Part 1]]\n* [[265: Choices: Part 2]]\n* [[266: Choices: Part 3]]\n* [[267: Choices: Part 4]]\n* [[268: Choices: Part 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan sits at a desk, using a computer, refreshing the page.]\n:''*Refresh*''\n:''Click''\n:[She sits back and looks at the monitor.]\n:[She refreshes the page on the computer.]\n:''*Refresh*''\n:''Click''\n:[She sits back and looks at the monitor.]\n:[Megan leans forward and clicks the mouse.]\n:''Click''\n:[A hole opens up in the panel. It appears to be the torn paper of the comic itself. A light-blue, sky-like background is revealed. Megan jumps in surprise, nearly tipping over her chair.]\n:[Megan stands up as the chair falls over completely.]\n:[Wide view. Megan looks back at the door furtively.]\n:[She begins to climb into the hole.]\n:[By now, Megan is entirely inside the hole. She is closing it behind her.]\n:[Only her head and arms are visible.]\n:[The hole is closed, revealing a formation of ripped paper.]\n:[Large frame, where Megan appears to be in space, with blue not black background. Stars dot the sky, and rays of light seem to originate from a point to the right, and then traverse the frame both horizontally and vertically, almost like lightning. Megan is in a bubble, floating disconnectedly. Both she and the bubble have become white, tinged against the backdrop.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThe text \"Megan is in a bubble\" is from the [https://xkcd.com/264/info.0.json original transcript] by [[Randall]]. At all other lines in that transcript, she is just \"a girl\".\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Choices]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Choices]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Space]]"
