Colds are bad!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is another in a [[:Category:COVID-19|series of comics]] related to the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}. \n\nThere is no hidden humor in this comic, it simply states an opinion. [[Randall]] is saying that he is looking forward to not having to wear a mask everywhere after the pandemic is over.  Mask mandates were a common way various organizations reduced the spread of Covid-19.  Now that the vaccines exist, people are assuming that these mask mandates will soon end, and in many jurisdictions they have already.\n\nHowever, Randall hopes that people will continue to wear a mask when they are sick, as is common in many East Asian countries.  This lets other people know the person may be sick, or trying to avoid becoming sick, so they can give the person extra distance.  Wearing a mask reduces the spread of infectious droplets when one exhales or coughs, and reduces exposure to droplets from others.  Both features help reduce the spread of communicable diseases.  Also, Randall thinks other people coughing on him is gross, as do most people.\n\nMasking when ill would help reduce influenza, [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110517162020.htm tuberculosis] and colds.  The flu is a deadly disease that usually kills tens of thousands of people each year.\n\nPeople with less common diseases, like tuberculosis, may be more likely to wear a mask if mask wearing becomes more common, so they don't feel as conspicuous. For less severe illnesses and less vulnerable populations xkcd's wish may not be such a good idea, as every cold - albeit unpleasant - constantly trains the immune system and keeps it alert.[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/common-cold-infection-may-train-the-body-to-recognise-and-fight-coronavirus/articleshow/77366133.cms?from=mdr]\n\nThe title text continues this line of reasoning by saying Randall wants to worry less about COVID-19, but hopes people would worry more about colds. Colds are generally mild and might cause someone to spend a few days home sick from work or school. However, colds cost [https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20030224/cost-of-common-cold-40-billion tens of billions of dollars annually] in the US.  Costs include the value of lost productivity at work or school, time spent caring for the sick, cost of doctor visits and medications.  Inappropriate treatment of colds with antibiotics is common, and contributes to the rise of {{W|antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistant bacteria}}, and {{W|clostridium difficile infection|clostridium difficile infections}}.[https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/for-patients/common-illnesses/colds.html].\n\nRandall has made a specific corona comic targeted at colds before: [[2306: Common Cold]]. And in 2015 he probably had a severe cold (or more than one) as he published these two comics [[1612: Colds]] and [[1618: Cold Medicine]] in December 2015.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Things I will not miss one bit after the Pandemic\n|Things I hope stick around and become normalized\n|-\n|Wearing masks everywhere\n|Wearing masks when you're feeling sick, because it's an easy way to tell people to give you space, and also getting coughed on is gross\n|}\n\n\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:COVID-19]]"
