In this comic, [[Cueball]] recounts how he used a command line hack to solve a problem with his monitors turning off during a movie, something that an attempt to change settings (possibly via a standard GUI configuration dialogue) has failed to resolve adequately. The scripted get-around appears to have worked, as far as it has been used.\n\nHowever, in an attempt to apply his dedication toward best programming practices to the solution, Cueball also became absorbed in fully documenting the mini-project. This could have been either alongside the project, keeping pace with the structured plan (e.g. the {{w|Waterfall model}}'s conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases), or as a 'necessary' final step to summarise the realized solution.\n\nIn either case, the sheer simplicity of the solution (for someone as technically minded as Cueball) suggests that the documentation writing has become the bulk of the effort. In the time that he spends trying to complete the issue to his satisfaction, the woman he had brought home had already left and the current opportunity to enjoy the movie (and company) was gone. Although at least it is likely that the ''next'' opportunity to {{w|Netflix and chill|enjoy a movie in company}}, with the same companion or another, will now run flawlessly. Or at least ''probably'' without this particular problem, if there is no problem with its implementation.\n\nThe title text applies this story's narrative in reverse. Whereas for Cueball to have a successful evening, he should have hastened the design process to the bare minimum required to provide a workable solution, it forces any designer of an interface (which would include the unsuccessful 'inbuilt' configuration wizard) to ensure that it at least does what it purports to do. If that had been done thoroughly enough, originally, someone like Cueball (and his date) would not have had this reason to be prevented from fully enjoying the evening as originally anticipated.\n\nSoftware that [http://google.com/search?q=mouse+wiggle jiggles the mouse] exists, as well as [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=608212 instructions for Linux scripting] (although installing the necessary libraries might take longer).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Two men talking.]\n:Cueball: Last night I was watching videos with this girl and my monitors kept turning off - even though I had disabled power save.\n:Friend: Odd.\n:Cueball: However! I wrote a command to jiggle the mouse pointer every couple minutes to keep it from going idle.\n:Friend: Not the first hack I'd try, but see? Linux has problems, but it gives you the tools to deal with them - and save your date!\n:Cueball: Actually, I was half an hour into the pointer scripting documentation when she got dressed and left.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:Time management]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
