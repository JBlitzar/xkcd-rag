It is a graph showing multiple areas corresponding to the number of photos taken per day by a user and the total time spent reviewing them.\n\nThe comic is split into 6 sectors as described below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sector\n!Caption\n!Explanation\n|-\n| Left sector / Low Amount of Photos Taken,  more than a little amount of time to sort \n| No problems\n| With only a few photos to sort, and lots of time to do so, Randall is able to maintain his photo library efficiently.\n|- \n| Bottom sector / Area under line increasing  where more time is spent as more photos are taken \n| Can't find the good photos among the thousands of bad ones\n| The amount of photos being taken is too high for Randall to adequately sort in the small amount of time he has. \n|- \n| Top sector / Area above line of negative gradient, as number of photos increases and time decreases\n| Can't sleep, too busy sifting through photos to find the best ones\n| Randall has taken too many photos, but has dedicated the time to sorting them. As a result, he is lacking sleep through his determination to complete the task.\n|-\n| Middle sector / Area in between both side lines, after No Problems but before cloud storage\n| Photo library fits on most devices as long as they're not too old\n| Randall takes quite a few photos, but still enough to fit on a more modern hard drive.\n|-\n| Middle-right sector / Area in between both side lines, after 'not too old' but before 'Moore's Law'\n| Need cloud storage, external hard drives, or frequent upgrades\n| Randall takes so many photos that he needs more storage than is on his computer to hold them.\n|-\n| Right sector / Area after 'cloud storage', going off until the two side lines meet\n| Photo library grows faster than Moore's Law\n| {{w|Moore's Law}} is a law that states that technology will keep getting better exponentially. However, Randall's photos take up so much space that even Moore's law can't catch up to the number of photos stored.\n|}\n\nAs Randall goes through more photos, he finds more bad ones, erases them and more storage becomes available. This allows taking more photos and still don't exceed the limits of the quota. This is why the \"secondary\" lines (e.g between the different storage types) are not completely vertical but tilted to the right at the top. \n\nThe title text states \"A good lifehack is to use messy and unstable systems to organize your photos. That way, every five years or so it becomes obsolete and/or collapses, and you have to open it up and pick only your favorite pictures to salvage.\" If you know that you will lose everything, that knowledge will encourage you to save what you want the most and leave everything else. It will also help decrease how many photos you have through the same awareness.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A line graph is shown. The x-axis is labeled \"Photos taken per day\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Time spent going through photos per day\". The content is divided into six sections:]\n\n:[Section 1: Few photos taken per day, no limit to time spent:]\n:\"No problems\"\n:[Section 2: Some photos taken per day, a limited amount of time spent going through:]\n:\"Photo library fits on most devices as long as they're not too old\"\n:[Section 3: More photos taken per day, less time spent going through:]\n:\"Need cloud storage, external hard drive, or frequent upgrades\"\n:[Section 4: A lot of photos taken per day, and even less time spent going through:]\n:\"Photo library grows faster than Moore's Law\"\n:[Section 5: Above line increasing where more time is spent as more photos are taken:]\n:\"Can't find the good photos among the thousands of bad ones\"\n:[Section 6: Below line of negative gradient, as number of photos increases and time decreases:]\n:\"Can't sleep, too busy sifting through photos to find the best one\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:Photography]]"
