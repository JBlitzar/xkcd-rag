It may have been inspired by Iceland being recently in the news for its {{w|2023 Sundhn√∫kur eruption|notable volcanic activity}}.\n\nNoting that being nearer the magnetic pole might more frequently provide you with an {{w|aurora}}, but the more severe (on the {{w|K-index#The Kp-index and estimated Kp-index|Kp index}}) geomagnetic storms invoke their auroral displays at lower latitudes. Once you get a Kp of 5 (out of a theoretical 9), Iceland may be far ''too'' close to the pole to fully appreciate the sight.\n\n{{w|HVAC}} in the title text is jargon for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The {{w|Gulf Stream}} is a warm and swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows through the Straits of Florida and up the eastern coastline of the United States, then veers east near 36 degrees latitude and moves toward Northwest Europe as the North Atlantic Current, providing Iceland with a milder and more liveable climate than would be otherwise expected for its latitude. The electrical costs associated with providing airflow at a certain temperature, over such a vast area would prove incredibly expensive, not to mention the fact that the Gulf Stream is not in fact an artificial phenomenon powered by electricity, but rather a natural one.{{cn}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing in front of a board and pointing to it with a stick. In front of him is a long table with White Hat, Blondie, another Cueball and Megan sitting on the long side of the table (the same side, the one away from the reader) with Hairbun sitting at the end of the table furthest from Cueball. All are sitting on office chairs and looking at Cueball. On the board there are two figures and some unreadable text. The top figure is an skewed ellipse with some dots inside. There is a label text beneath it. The next large figure depicts an island with a rift going down its middle. The rift extends on either side of the island. There is a label above it. Beneath this there is a box with four lines of unreadable text and above it a heading. Cueball's stick points to the island.]\n:Cueball: Okay, we'll make it an island on a mid-ocean ridge to satisfy the mantle people and the oceanographers.\n:Cueball-like man: But what about my glaciers?\n:Cueball: We can just pile them on the volcanoes.\n:Hairbun: Don't forget that it has to be near a pole - I was promised aurora!\n\n:[Caption below the comic:]\n:Iceland was designed by a committee of planetary scientists that was trying to satisfy everyone.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Blondie]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Geography]]\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Engineering]]"
