From her description, ''zapped you with energy beams'', it sounds like they just took an {{w|Projectional radiography|x-ray image}}, maybe in the form of a {{w|CT scan}}, and Ponytail is following up on the results. It appears that he may have {{w|appendicitis}}, the title of the comic, which could be treated through {{w|antibiotics}}, or through an {{w|appendectomy}} surgery.\n\nAs is typical for Doctor Ponytail, she characterizes the diagnosis in a strange, militaristic and not particularly helpful way, likening Cueball's inflamed appendix to an armed rebellion or insurgency. In some ways, this is not a bad metaphor - Cueball is an organism, and as such, functions best when all of his organic parts are working correctly in unison, much as do national governments and economies. People often express a similar sentiment of being \"betrayed by their own body\" to describe a biological function that isn't working right. However, Dr. Ponytail insists on talking \"only\" in military metaphors, preventing Cueball from getting any useful medical details about his condition. This may suggest a background in {{w|military medicine}} or simply a very strange view of the world on her part. \n\nAntibiotic treatment is described as using \"chemical / biological weapons\" (typically considered an extreme military tactic but a common first step in treating illness), while the appendectomy is described as \"victory through the sword\". She further describes more extreme \"battle tactics\", like crushing all other rebellions in his body. Lastly, she mentions \"salting his abdomen\" to prevent other rebellions. This is a reference to the {{w|salting the earth}} tactic in battle, which was a ritual to symbolize a curse on a conquered city and would have theoretically hindered future crop production, thus preventing that city from being rebuilt. It is likely that the medical usage would be the application of saline solution, salt in water, which is used for cleaning wounds.\n\nAfter all this explanation, Cueball begins to question Ponytail's strange and militaristic methods, and requests to see a different doctor to get a {{w|Second_opinion#Medicine|second opinion}}. \n\nThe title text appears to be [[Randall]] speaking directly to the reader addressing a recent appendicitis and his current health state. He continues the comic's joke with a meta reference pondering the repercussions if his organs subsequently discover this comic. The title text of [[2508: Circumappendiceal Somectomy]], from August 2021, seems to indicate that while antibiotics may have cured this event, a later infection required surgery anyway, a bit more than two years after this comic was released.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is seated on an medical examination table, clutching his stomach, while Ponytail stands dressed in a doctor's coat holding a file on a clipboard in her left hand.]\n:Ponytail: Well, we zapped you with energy beams, and it looks like one of your stupid organs is a traitor.\n:Cueball: ...which one?\n:Ponytail: I dunno, appendix? Gallbladder? One of the little ones that sucks.\n:Cueball: What should I do?\n\n:[Closeup on Ponytail. She holds her left hand in a clenched fist.]\n:Ponytail: You could quash the revolt with the ruthless deployment of chemical and biological weapons.\n:Cueball (off-screen): ...antibiotics?\n:Ponytail: But certain victory comes only through ''the sword''.\n:Cueball (off-screen): Surgery.\n\n:[Closeup on Ponytail with her fists raised.]\n:Ponytail: While we're inside, we'll look around-if we see any signs of insurrection elsewhere, we will not hesitate to act. There can be no armistice. Your parts must fall in line or be crushed.\n:Cueball (off-screen): Um.\n\n:[Zoom out again to the entire scene. Ponytail points her left hand up.]\n:Ponytail: When the battle is won, we will salt your abdomen so no new organs can ever sprout up to trouble you again.\n:Cueball: Maybe I should get a second opinion.\n:Ponytail: Only if you care what a ''weaker'' doctor would say.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Doctor Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Medicine]]"
