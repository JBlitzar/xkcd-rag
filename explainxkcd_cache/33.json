The previous one was [[32: Pillar]], and the next one was [[41: Old Drawing]].\n\n==Explanation==\n[[:Category:Self-reference|Self-reference]] is a situation where something (a comic, a drawing, a musical work, a novel, a mathematical theorem) refers to itself in some manner. This can be a powerful technique in art, music, mathematics, and computer science (it is the basis of recursion). In this comic, [[Cueball]] promises not to use self-reference for humor, and then realizes after a beat panel that, since this comic is referring to the series of comics he is part of, he is using self-reference, thus breaking his promise. Without the last panel, this comic wouldn't be funny, and therefore wouldn't break the promise about using self-reference for humor. But with it, and his realization that he is breaking his promise, it does break that promise. Self-references would be most famously used later in [[688: Self-Description]], but also in [[6: Irony]] and [[:Category:Self-reference|many other comics]].\n\nThe title text is just another humorous self-reference, which cites itself as a reason for Cueball/Randall thinking about self-reference, becoming self-referential in the process.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing alone.]\n:Cueball: I promise to never again squeeze humor out of self-reference.\n\n:[Beat panel.]\n\n:[Cueball is standing alone.]\n:Cueball: God dammit.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The original title of the comic was wrong, as this comic was released on a Monday, not a Friday. The [[32: Pillar|previous comic]] was actually supposed to come out on a Friday, but [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] forgot to post it in time and released in on a Saturday.
