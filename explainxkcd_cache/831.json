Much like 'the shuffle on my MP3 player has a bias', this is occasionally true but universally believed. Brains are so interesting!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nA {{w|weather radar}} is a device which uses the reflection of radio waves from rain or snow to detect where there is rainfall. The information from the radar is then shown on a map. In this case green means light rain while red or white represent very heavy rain - possibly a {{w|thunderstorm}}. These maps can be quite beautiful and mesmerizing to look at. In this case the speaker (who is located where the black dot is) enjoys watching interesting, unexpected events on the radar and is surprised to see a massive, unexpected storm heading straight for him. A storm indeed appears but splits in half and passes either side of him. The reaction of the speaker shows that this has happened before.\n\nThe caption suggests that this happens when the people who run the radar notice you looking at the page enough they tease you by adding a fake storm coming towards you which then disappears just as it approaches the speaker.\n\nThe title text explores how our perceptions are often inaccurate - someone may think that there are fewer storms than when they were young or that certain songs come up more often on their MP3 player, even when they don't. There are lots of these {{w|List of cognitive biases|types of biases in judgement}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A black dot on a pixelated weather radar screen.]\n:Sigh. Just a few clouds.\n\n:[The clouds develop into orange, to the left of the dot.]\n:Whoa! Huge storm out of nowhere!\n\n:[The orange becomes red, and the storm moves towards the dot.]\n:It's ''growing!'' And headed right for me! ''Awesome!''\n\n:[The storm splits in half.]\n:Hey! What's it...\n\n:[The two halves of the storm pass by the dot.]\n:Dammit! ''Again?!''\n\n:When the folks at the weather offices see you refreshing the radar too often, they start teasing you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Weather]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
