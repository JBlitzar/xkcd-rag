Cueball points out that they could've stayed home and used {{w|Photoshop}} to alter pictures they've already taken, saving themselves the trouble of going on the trip. The {{w|hue}} control in such image editing programs shifts the colors around the spectrum without altering the brightness; the green leaves in a summer picture could then easily be shifted to yellow or red. \n\nMegan simply shushes him in the strip, but the title text is implied to be Megan's retort, saying that Cueball used to be a happier person, and if he will continue being like this, she would prefer to see him in old pictures rather than living with him. Or it could be that Cueball is making a response to the shush as he seems to be the more technologically inclined and more annoyed.\n\nThe comic is also showing how, because of technology, many people are not as \"happy\" as they once were. Instead of appreciating natural beauty, Cueball simply wishes to \"replicate\" the experience by using Photoshop; unfortunately, this would deprive him of both the experience of beautiful fall leaves and a shared intimacy with Megan.\n\nSee also [[1314: Photos]] about people taking pictures and White Hat complaining.\nLater in [[1719: Superzoom]] White Hat and Cueball again discusses photography, while in [[2111: Opportunity Rover]] White Hat shares his anti-photography opinion again.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are standing on a cliff overlooking a forest of gorgeous orange foliage. The forest grows up a hill and behind and right of the forest there are is forest free hill and in the horizon two small mountain peaks rises up to the gray blue sky. Cueball is holding his camera down while Megan is holding her camera up taking a photo. As opposed to normal the text is written inside two speech bubbles with arrow ending pointing at the two. Also the sound of the camera is written inside a white area with small u shapes forming part of the frame for this sound.]\n:Cueball: Instead of driving all this way, we could've just taken our summer pictures and messed with the \"hue\" slider in Photoshop.\n:Megan: Hush.\n:Camera:  ''Click''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Photography]]\n[[Category:Computers]]"
