The previous comic in the series [[1549: xkcd Phone 3]] was released just over a year before this one and the next [[1809: xkcd Phone 5]] was released almost 8 months later.\n\nThe tagline of the phone is a reference to the tenth version of Apple's operating system for its {{w|Macintosh computer}}. It was named {{w|OS X}} and was intended to be read as \"oh ess ten\", but [[Steve Jobs]] was irritated that everyone else preferred \"oh ess ecks\". This phrase is labeled with trademark and copyright symbols, as if someone desires it to be the product's {{w|tagline}} but has poor understanding of relevant laws. In particular, \"<big>{{w|™}}</big>\" is a symbol for {{w|unregistered trademark}}s while \"<big>{{w|®}}</big>\" is a symbol for {{w|registered trademark}}s. If the phrase were an unregistered trademark, the owner would be prohibited from using \"<big>{{w|®}}</big>\". \n\nFrom the top, going clockwise:\n\n; 18,000 μAh (micro-Ampere hours) nickel-lithium-iron battery (non-rechargeable)\n\n: Phone battery capacity is measured in {{w|ampere-hour}}s (which, thanks to {{w|dimensional analysis}}, is just an unusual way of denoting electric charge; one ampere-hour is 3600 Coulombs). Usually, the capacity is quoted in milliampere-hours (one-thousandth, or 10<sup>-3</sup>, of an ampere hour); however, this one is quoted in ''micro''ampere-hours (one-millionth, or 10<sup>-6</sup>, of an ampere-hour), presumably as a marketing ploy to give a more impressive-looking number. Quoted in more standard terms, this phone's battery capacity is 18 mAh. In comparison, an iPhone 6+ has a battery capacity of 2,750 mAh.  This phone's battery is dreadful (under a typical current draw of 0.1A, it would power the phone for about 11 minutes). There is nothing normally called a \"nickel-lithium-iron battery\" — rather, this seems to be a [[739|malamanteau]] of the experimental {{w|nickel–lithium battery}} and the common {{w|lithium ion battery}} (which does not contain any iron) or the lithium-iron-phosphate battery, often called lithium-iron, but more often called the LiFePO battery. The {{w|nickel–iron battery}} may contain {{w|lithium hydroxide}}, but it's ''terrible'' for most applications. Worse, this battery is non-rechargeable, meaning that it would have to be replaced to use the phone again after it is exhausted (every 11 minutes, at that!). The [[xkcd Phone 3]] was powered by two {{w|AA battery|AA batteries}} (not included), which have an energy capacity roughly 100 times larger.\n\n; Subwoofer\n\n: A {{w|subwoofer}} is a large bass speaker, which this is not.{{Citation needed}} Some phones do have high-quality speakers for playing music, but these are not placed right next to the earpiece — this would be a surefire way to deafen your users. When put next to Dog Whistle, this is probably a pun, since both relate to dogs; the English onomatopoeia for the sound a dog makes is \"Woof\".\n\n; \"Dog whistle\"\n\n: A {{w|dog whistle}} is a high-pitched whistle that humans cannot hear, but dogs can. In speaker terminology, a bass speaker is called a {{w|woofer}} because it could reproduce the low pitch of a dog bark. A treble speaker is a {{w|tweeter}}; if this \"whistle\" is actually a speaker, it might be termed a ''supertweeter''. The scare quotes may be a reference to \"{{w|dog-whistle politics}}\", in which certain phrases have a particular meaning to a segment of the audience that passes unnoticed by the rest. This allows a candidate to surreptitiously signal agreement with that group, without alienating the rest of the audience, among whom the ideas might be unpopular if plainly stated. The [[xkcd Phone 2]] contained a \"dog noticer\".\n\n; Non-porous, washable\n\n: On the one hand, it's rare for a phone to be made of porous materials.{{Citation needed}} On the other, there are legitimately waterproof phones that seal the speakers and ports with rubber. The [[xkcd Phone 2]] was also washable (though only once).\n\n; ''WebMD'' partnership<nowiki>:</nowiki> cough-activated feature reads aloud a random diagnosis for \"coughing\"\n\n: {{w|WebMD}} is a website to help people diagnose themselves. For the vast majority of people, a cough just means an irritated throat or maybe a cold, but selecting randomly from all WebMD diagnoses gives some much more ominous — if very unlikely — ones, including {{w|ricin}} poisoning, {{w|plague}}, {{w|lung cancer}} and {{w|radiation poisoning}}.\n\n; Wings\n\n: These {{w|wings}} resemble the ones found on {{w|sanitary towel}}s (usually called \"pads\", making this a possible iPad pun) which attach the pad to the {{w|gusset}} and keep it in place between the woman's legs during her period ({{w|Menstruation}} cycle). If actually functional as {{w|aerodynamic}} wings, they would likely come into play when the \"SpaceX\" impact protection feature becomes engaged and would likely make holding the phone awkward if rigid. The [[xkcd Phone 3]] had a similarly positioned wristband.\n\n; Beveled bezel\n\n: The ''bezel'' is the ring around the edge of watches and screens. This one's {{w|bevel}}ed, which means it's cut at an angle.\n\n; Bezeled bevel\n\n: Punning on the above. Doesn't make much sense but could mean that it features a beveled edge which is surrounded by a bezel.\n\n; Seedless\n\n: Fruit such as grapes can be \"seedless\", which means that they're grown from a special {{w|cultivar}} that doesn't grow seeds in the normal way. Making a phone seedless probably won't do anything, but {{w|Random seed|it might hurt}} its {{w|random number generator}} (or make it better if proper alternative to PRNG is introduced). Alternatively, this might be a dig at Apple's iPhone. There are [https://farmingbase.com/why-are-some-apples-seedless/ seedless apples]. The [[xkcd Phone 3]] was boneless.\n\n; Water resistant down to 30 meters and below 50\n\n: {{w|Water resistance}} is often measured in terms of how deep an object can be submerged, since pressure increases with depth. In this case, the phone can be submerged to almost any depth, but there's an odd lacuna between 30 meters and 50 meters. It also plays with the confusion in describing depths greater than 50m as \"below 50\". Alternatively, this might indicate the phone must remain dry above 50 meters altitude, or that it is not water resistant between 30 and 50 meters but is waterproof otherwise. The [[xkcd Phone]] and [[XKCD Phone 3]] could drown. The latter was otherwise waterproof. [[xkcd Phone 2]] was only waterproof internally. A similarly absurd range was used in [[870: Advertising]]: \"Up to 15% or more!\".\n\n; Turing-complete\n\n: A computer is {{w|Turing completeness|Turing complete}} if it can perform all the operations needed to simulate a {{w|Turing machine}}. All modern computers are usually described as Turing complete, which would make this not very impressive, but no computer can ever be Turing complete in the truest sense (since they can only ever have a finite amount of memory) — if the xkcd Phone 4 is truly a universal computer, it's ''very'' impressive indeed.\n\n; Gregorian/Julian calendar date switch\n\n: The {{w|Julian calendar}} is the predecessor to the modern {{w|Gregorian calendar}} — the difference is that the two calendars calculate leap years differently. The current difference between the calendars is 13 days, which will remain unchanged until February 2100. The Julian calendar is still used occasionally — mainly by Eastern Orthodox Christians — but it's not something so vital that it needs a hardwired switch on the front of the phone. This may be a play on the ability to switch the time display between a 12-hour clock and a 24-hour clock. It could also be playing with the ability to switch between Daylight Savings Time and Standard or change time zones. \n\n; ''SpaceX'' impact protection<nowiki>:</nowiki> when dropped, phone lands on barge\n\n: The rocket company {{w|SpaceX}}, at the time that this comic was released, had recently trialed a {{w|SpaceX reusable launch system development program|reusable rocket stage}} which, after separating from the launch vehicle, lands on a {{w|Autonomous spaceport drone ship|drone barge}} to be reused. Making a phone land on the nearest barge when dropped would make it very difficult to recover, although the 11-minute battery time there might be a chance to get it even if you can't catch it.\n\n; Parallel port\n\n: A {{w|parallel port}} is a type of interface which transfers high-volume simultaneous data. It was often used to connect printers and other devices to computers but was generally considered obsolete by the time smartphones began to appear on the market and would be very bulky and slow compared to the USB ports generally used in phones. It was commonly found together with {{w|serial port}}s, which are used for low-volume sequential data such as [[485: Depth|mouse]] [[1110: Click and Drag|movements]]. Here it is paired with a serial interface for analog data with parallel outputs for several people.\n\n; 12 headphone jacks\n\n: Headphone jacks are circular ports in a phone that allow audio to be played through headphones connected to the jack. There were [http://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-headphone-jack-iphone-side-effects-2016-7#/#smaller-headphone-makers-would-be-at-a-disadvantage-4 constant rumors] that Apple's next iPhone would not have any headphone jacks (which eventually proved true for the iPhone 7 announcement two months after this comic). Also, [http://www.google.com Google] was developing a module for the now cancelled [https://atap.google.com/ara/ Project Ara] (archive [https://web.archive.org/web/20160716080118/https://atap.google.com/ara/ here]), a modular smartphone. This module allows the device to have [http://www.overclock3d.net/news/audio/sennheiser_shows_audio_module_concepts_for_project_ara/1 Four headphone jacks], which would allow audio to be shared among 4 people, each occupying one port. The xkcd phone takes this too far when they install a whopping TWELVE of them, which is completely overkill because almost nobody needs to connect to 12 headphones at once. 12 headphones will also drain the battery, like the wireless discharging in the [[XKCD Phone 3]], because playing audio through 24 speakers, two for each pair of headphones, is very power-consuming.\n\n; Onboard cloud\n\n: The \"cloud\" is a catch-all term for the use of remote computers to store data, providing a backup if all local copies are lost and allowing the data to be accessed from a broad network. An \"onboard cloud\" would thus be a contradiction in terms and appears to be a marketing ploy to use the \"cloud\" buzzword to describe the device's onboard storage capacity.\n\n; New BrightGlo<sup>TM</sup> display incorporates genetically spliced jellyfish protein (should have used the glowing genes, not the stinging ones)\n\n: {{w|Aequorea victoria}} is a species of jellyfish that contains {{w|green fluorescent protein}}, a gene that is bioluminescent and gives off light. This protein was supposed to be used to light the phone's screen. Unfortunately, the developers messed up, and accidentally took the [http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-015-1568-3 stinging kind], which means that touching the phone screen will be as painful as a jellyfish sting i.e. very painful.\n\n; ✓ Certified\n\n: The phone is just certified in general and doesn't specify what part of the phone has been certified. It might be a reference to [[1096: Clinically Studied Ingredient]], in which buzzwords such as \"studied\" and are intended to make a given product sound more legitimate.\n\n; Software-defined\n\n: {{w|Software-defined radio}}s are quite popular in some areas, meaning the radio hardware is quite universal and can be adapted to different radio protocols just by changing software. SDR would actually be quite a nice feature for a cellphone. Of course, it doesn't specify if it's the radio that is software defined.\n\n; Exposed ductwork\n\n: A phone shouldn't even have ductwork, unless it has a very sophisticated cooling system, but this could supply air to the dog whistle. Exposed ductwork is a trademark of {{w|Bowellism|Bowellist}} architecture such as the {{w|Lloyd's Building}} in London and the {{w|Pompidou Centre}} in Paris. Exposed ductwork is also considered a crucial flaw in a death star. May also refer to a transparent window in the side of the phone allowing the user to see the circuitry inside, similar to computer cases with transparent side panels popular among DIY computing enthusiasts.\n\n; Voice interaction<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{w|Siri (software)|Siri}}, {{w|Cortana (software)|Cortana}}, {{w|Google Now}} and {{w|Amazon Echo|Alexa}} respond simultaneously\n\n: These are all {{w|intelligent personal assistant software}} (from Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon respectively) and all do the same thing: control your phone and answer questions using speech recognition. Having all four talks at once would mean you'd have a total cacophony while gaining nothing. The [[xkcd Phone 3]] could have Siri (\"or whoever it was [they] put in here\") included.\n\nThe title text pokes fun at the number of SpaceX rockets that [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3wZRdg-Tmo crashed and exploded] before they got the landing gear right.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[An image of a smartphone featuring wings is shown.
