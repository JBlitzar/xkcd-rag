If needed, reorganise it, use tables, or divide it into subsections. It might be easier to navigate to have [[#jump|the notifications]] divided into subsections, one for each type of notification, so we can have smaller, separate tables that are easier to browse. In that same section, we can move the explanation of when they appear and move the image they are related to.\n\n*The [[#Trivia]] section doesn't fully explain the apparent delayed launch of the comic. Give examples of other delayed comics and add more information about this one, sucha as the text of the first notification and what it means.\n\n*The gallery is missing many image links! Links to all images are on the index.js at ''https://xkcd.com/3074/marconi/static/js/index.js?v{{=}}1''. You can easily identify them, they look like this: '''static/xyz.png'''\n**[https://xkcd.com/3074/marconi/static/js/index.js?v{{=}}1 That same link] contains all the comic pictures, ''including each notification'', so download each notification image from [https://xkcd.com/3074/marconi/static/js/index.js?v{{=}}1 here] (use Ctrl+F to search for \"static/\" links, and then paste into the URL in the address bar), and create a new section for them! This way, we can showcase the initial notification flow in order. (Make sure to download the bigger version, labelled \"4x\" instead of \"2x\"!).\n\n*Most of the transcripts for the additional [[#Comic images]] are not descriptive enough.\n\n* Need to finish explaining the [[#jump|table with all the notifications]] and copy the images that go along with them. Notifications that are confirmed to be related to image changes should have the image in its explanation. (You can take the image from the section [[#Comic images]].)}}\nThe comic uses {{w|push notifications}} to change the comic image over time and make other statements. Upon viewing the comic for the first time, a sequence of notifications will be rendered over the comic itself. The notifications have a fade-in animation and appear one after another. The sequence is divided into several \"groups\" of notifications, each containing up to 4 regular notifications and an interactable button, which has a circled arrow icon to the right as well as a different text color. Clicking the arrow removes all notifications on screen and proceeds the sequence to the next group.\n\nAt the end of the sequence, a red-background option to sign up for xkcd notifications is presented. This part differs depending on if the user is \"playing\" from a mobile or desktop browser.\n\n* On desktop, clicking this will result in the browser prompting the user to allow or block [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com]'s request to send push notifications. By allowing, the game begins. If blocked, the comic shows a message \"An actual error occurred {{nowrap|:(}}\", and the laptop bursts into flames (see the image in the [[#Comic images|table below]]). It also blows up in response to any other browser error, such as a 500 Internal Server Error, which is reported to happen if you click the pause button too quickly.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\n* On mobile, a new on-screen notification will show up, telling the user to add zk to their home screen in order for it to send push notifications on mobile. Upon doing so and opening the webpage from the home screen, the system will prompt the user to allow or block push notifications from this webpage. The outcomes of allowing and denying are the same as on desktop.\n\nOnce the game begins, you are provided with two buttons: one labeled \"Emergency Stop\", and one labeled \"Silence notifications at a cost\". Clicking the \"Emergency Stop\" button allows you to either restart the full game or to subscribe just to thrice-weekly notifications for new xkcd comics, while the second button will temporarily silence notifications, supposedly at the cost of notifying two random people.\n\nThe title text references the {{w|Lernaean Hydra}}, a multi-headed serpent-like monster from Greek mythology; the Greek hero {{w|Heracles}} was tasked with slaying the Hydra as {{w|Labours_of_Hercules#Second:_Lernaean_Hydra|the second of his twelve labours}}. When he cut off one of its heads, however, two heads would grow in its place, resulting in more heads than before; Heracles soon realized he could not kill the Hydra in this fashion. It describes a similar situation with the \"Notification Hydra\": a push notification \"head\" of the Notification Hydra was dismissed, which subsequently spawned two more push notification heads providing updates about the status of the dismissal. If one of these new notifications were to be dismissed, it would again spawn another set of the same two push notification heads; thus, the Notification Hydra is unkillable in a manner similar to the original.\n\nUp to 7 clickable cats periodically spawn at predetermined positions around the page, including one on the edge of the Emergency Stop button. The subdirectory where the images and scripts for this comic are stored is titled 'marconi,' which is likely a reference to the Italian engineer and inventor of the same name, {{w|Guglielmo Marconi}}, who is credited with inventing the radio, and did much work in the field of early communication systems.\n\n===Notifications===\n[[File:zoom_turtle.png|thumb|500px|right|When graphing the coordinates from the zoom notifications, a turtle and a squirrel appear.]]\n\nA general list of notification types include:\n* The \"Zoom notifications\" only include numeric coordinates, sometimes prefixed with \"oh look!\". Plotting the normal coordinates creates an image of a turtle, a reference to [[1416: Pixels]], while the [[#look|coordinates prefixed with \"oh look!\"]] create a squirrel behind the turtle. See the image above.\n\n* A few starter notifications about this comic, the successful sending of a notification of this comic, and the lack of another comic.\n\n* An announcement that an old comic was posted, specifying a (seemingly) random comic and its publication date. The publication date seems to be shown in a random {{w|Calendar date|calendar date format}}.\n\n* A word game where a first notification asks you to type a word, with further notifications apparently to be sent whenever someone chooses the same word as you.\n** The word can be chosen by clicking on the first notification, which lands you in the comic page. The comic pane will be changed to a comic-style input dialogue with a space for the word and a submit button. Upon providing a word, a notification informs you that you will then receive notifications (of the form \"Someone else has selected the word <Your Word>!\"), and that your choice is permanent and cannot be changed. You can also submit a blank text field, thus receiving \"Someone else has selected the word !\" notifications.\n\n* A \"streak\" notification counting the number of times you've clicked it. To start with, the message changes every 10 clicks; then every 50 clicks (after 100) and then at increasing intervals. After every 50 clicks there is an offer to make future clicks count twice, making this a simple version of {{w|Cookie Clicker}}. If you choose to accept the offer by clicking on it, it will reset your clicks back to zero but makes all future clicks count double of the current click rate; you can also reject the offer by continuing to click on the click counter message. There are occasionally notifications encouraging you to keep clicking and \"extend your streak,\" tempting you with \"a free click to keep you going\". After 400 clicks it will reset your clicks back to zero but makes all future clicks count four times.\n** Early notifications encourage further clicking.\n** Approaching a hundred, the messages grow more concerned and later start warning that the server will crash or has crashed.\n** Above 750: \"Are you just doing this to annoy me?\"\n** 1000-2000: \"You're just doing this to annoy you?\"\n** Above 2000: \"I guess it worked\"\n** Above 1000000: \"Wow, you're really into this\"\n\n* \"Constant reminders\" with references to mathematical, physical, or some other constants. The constant values are stated to be \"at the tone\", likely in reference to {{w|Speaking clock|time-of-day phone services}}, which are live or recorded human voice services that tell you the exact time \"at the third stroke\" over the phone.  (In at least some portions of the USA, the wording did use \"tone\" rather than \"strike.\"  For example, \"At the tone, the time will be 2:32pm, and 10 seconds ... (beep)\")\n\n* A \"have you seen my cat?\" notification which causes all the cats to spawn when clicked. \n\n* Cat fact notifications that appear when a cat is clicked, in reference to [https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/owx3v/so_my_little_cousin_posted_on_fb_that_he_was/ this exchange].\n\n* Various \"Erroneous Alerts\" with a warning triangle {{w|emoji}} (⚠ U+26A0), some with just flavor text, some corresponding to changes in the comic image.\n\n* A notification that offers to provide weather alerts for your location, which leads into a series of notifications asking whether you live in a named city. If none of the cities that it knows are selected, your location is set to the summit of {{w|Mount Washington}}.\n\n* When the time is near a full hour or half-hour, that the current time is five o'clock.\n\n* An invitation to subscribe to the \"What if?\" YouTube channel\n\n* A notification with the heading \"System Log\" that reads (INFO): A user has paused notifications\n** This notification presumably appears when a random user has pressed the \"Silence notifications at a cost\" button.\n\n* A \"{{w|Carriage return|Carriage Return}} Line Feed\", referencing the Windows standard of storing line returns as a carriage return character followed by a line feed (newline) character. However, the xkcd Carriage Return Line Feed is instead a news feed concerning the next stop on a supposed \"Carriage Return Line\" of a train system. The announcements are all<!-- all my examples, and those logged on the appropriate subpage, so probably not geolocated with different systems' stops for different users --> related to stations on the {{w|London Underground}}, including the use of the phrase \"{{w|Mind the gap}}\".\n\n* A reminder to comment and subscribe. When clicked, they redirect the user to one of the following Wikipedia Talk pages:\n\n{{cot|Wikipedia Talk pages}}\n<div style=\"column-width:20em\">\n* {{w|Talk:Mathematics}}\n\n*
