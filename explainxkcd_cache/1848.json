Not wishing to bow down to the forces of nature, Megan tries to take it back to its rightful place, obviously in vain.\n\nMegan is annoyed with the glacier for just {{w|Litter|littering}} the place up with rocks. She wishes to put it back in place, just like picking up a piece of litter and putting it in the trash bin where it belongs.\n\nThe title text furthers the absurdity by suggesting that Megan is extra annoyed with having to clean up after the glacier, because it will take a long time (and as she put it \"Fuck Glaciers\"). The problem for Megan is that she is already using her time {{w|Chisel|chiselling}} out {{w|Intrusive_rock|igneous intrusions}} which is another type of rock formation caused by solidification of {{w|magma}}, which Megan also plans to undo. To soothe her mind she keeps watching [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgsnWtBQm0 the scene] from the {{w|Superman (1978 film)|Superman film}} where {{w|Superman}} turns back time to prevent an earthquake and thus also create a fault-sealing by reversing the creation of the fault in the first place. He also prevents the destruction of the {{w|Hoover Dam}} and the death of {{w|Lois Lane}}, but it seems like this is not important to Megan. She is only interested in undoing what nature has already done, and if the Superman scene could be made real it would solve her problems.\n\nThis may be a play on words based on the word \"erratic,\" as Megan's behavior could be described as such.\n\nMegan's actions here are reminiscent of the ones carried out by [[Cueball]] in [[1119: Undoing]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail and Megan walks up to a large rock, Ponytail points at it.]\n:Ponytail: That rock is a glacial erratic-A glacier broke it off from those hills and placed it here.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel they stand and watch the rock.]\n:Megan: What? And just ''left'' it here? \n:Megan: And everybody's ''okay'' with this?\n\n:[Megan tries to lift the rock with two hands.] \n\n:[Megan turns her back to the rock and tries to push it with all her might.]\n:Megan: Get...\n:Megan: ...back...\n\n:[Ponytail looks on as Megan again has turned around and tries to roll the boulder using both hands.]\n:Ponytail: Why ... Why are you doing that?\n:Megan: ''Because fuck glaciers!''\n\n==Trivia==\n*This appears to be the last xkcd comic to feature any level of profanity.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Geography]]\n[[Category:Fiction]] <!--Superman->"
