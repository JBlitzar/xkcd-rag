We need to:\n*Move the parts of this introduction to their relevant section (or just delete them entirely if they're duplicated), to make [[#Explanation]] easier to skim.\n*Mention the fact that this comic is currently broken, and describe the last title text, \"null\". (last paragraph of [[#Explanation]])}}\n\nIn this April Fools' Day comic, the user input changes the comic, although in the last two, [[1350: Lorenz]] and [[1506: xkcloud]], it was written (or drawn) input that became part of the comics. This time the user input is like a game, as the user actively adds, moves and deletes items, and new items appear based on these actions. In this way it actually more resembles the game comic [[1608: Hoverboard]], than the previous April Fools' Day comic. Due to technical problems (or to make fools of his fans, see more about the [[#Header text|header text]] below) the comic did not go live until Sunday evening (after midnight, so technically on Monday April 4th) so there was no Friday release the week before, see [[#Monday 4th of April release|more details below]].\n\nThe comic begins with a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f1/Garden_Loading_collage.png loading screen] with a revolving tree and the text \"Loading...\" This is because the first time a computer loads this dynamic comic it can take a while. Once it's loaded, it displays \"Your '''Garden'''\", being a barren landscape, with a small pond to the left, some rocks at the far left and right, and a single lamp shining light yellow light on most of the ground. If you leave the lights on and wait (or \"relax\", as the reader is told to do by the title text), then plants and other items will start to appear. The reason it is correct to call it \"your garden\" is that every time this comic is loaded from scratch, a new garden will be created with a unique URL address. By [[#Saving your garden|saving this link]], the user is able to return to their garden repeatedly. This is important because the garden develops very slowly.\n\n[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/78/1663_garden_Three_colors_over_everything_not_very_interesting.png Plants] appear one at a time, but only a few of the plants actually grow. For instance, there are some large trees that begins as [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/27/1663_garden_Fast_growing_tree_-_leafless.png a large trunk] and from there [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/67/1663_garden_Fast_growing_tree_-_lots_of_leaves.png grows branches and leaves]. This can sometimes happen quite fast. Most other plants just appear, the only other exception being one type of flowers. All plants, except the cactus, visibly sway in the breeze. Also [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5a/1663_garden_Pruned_garden_with_birds_deer_gate_cactus_turtles_snake_gate.png animals] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/de/1663_garden_Three_lamps_two_along_ground_with_pillars_not_in_blue_world_and_symmetric_gates.png building-like structures] such as [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/15/1663_garden_Megan_Monolith_Animals_and_more.png a monolith and birdbaths] appear, together with lots of other items like [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/ad/1663_garden_Office_space_with_star_plant_balloon_with_bird_and_grass_on_Cueball.png office furniture] with [https://xkcd.com/1663/#98dc3452-fcf2-11e5-8010-42010a8e0008 balloons swaying in the wind] or even one of the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/3f/1663_garden_One_color_Between_orange_red_and_red_First_thing_Mars_rover.png Mars rovers] which have often [[:Category:Mars rovers|been featured]] on xkcd.\n\nOn top of all this, several known characters may appear in different poses including [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] (for instance with a sword, see [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/6/6b/1663_garden_Megan_with_sword%2C_trees_octopuses_with_Cueball_bunny_ducklings.png here]), [[Ponytail]] (see [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/eb/1663_garden_Ponytail_and_two_Cueballs_cat_pillar_and_trunk_sE.png here]) and [[Beret Guy]] from the torso and up (see [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/9/9b/1663_garden_Three_colors_more_separate_Beret_Guy_in_shrubbery_and_Octopus_on_office_desk.png here]). Megan and also Cueball can both be seen [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/06/1663_garden_Giant_planter_on_pillars_and_both_Cueball_and_Megan_with_black_hat.png with a black hat], but it is one that \"grows\" on top of their heads after they first appear. However, Cueball with a black hat automatically turns into [[Black Hat]], so he can also be said to be in this comic. There is also an unknown character, a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/0c/1663_garden_One_color_Between_Light_yellow_and_yellow_First_thing_stilts.png girl on stilts] with black hair in a ponytail who like plants and balloons [https://xkcd.com/1663/#e774b4b8-fcd4-11e5-8001-42010a8e0017 sways in the wind]. A possible origin of this girl could be the What If article [https://whatif.xkcd.com/97/ Burning Pollen]. The article involves a character with seasonal allergies that is trying unsuccessfully to avoid their allergen (pollen) with giant stilts.\n\nAll the [[#Garden items|items that can appear]] in the garden are listed below in several tables. During the first week new items kept appearing, but after the eighth day (April 12th), no new items have appeared. Also the growth rate (and thus the fun of this comic) has decreased with time (maybe due to the enormous number of gardens that the server has to keep track of?) .\n\nEvery so often the image will refresh. You can change the number of lamps, their position, direction, beam width and the color temperature which always begins somewhere between white and yellow but can change all the way from red to blue (See this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b8/Garden_Three_Lamp_screen_shot.png example] with one lamp selected and three colors of light). Other colors than those four may appear where two lamps' cones of different colored light overlap.\n\nThe color of light [[#Effect of light|affects the growth]] with a strong correlation for what appears in the garden depending on the [[#Lamps and colors|color of the light]], and this is not only split between red, yellow and blue, but rather [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/4a/1663_garden_Numbered_color_scale_1-17.png 10 different colors]. \n\nEarly on it became clear that pure red-light results in a desert theme with [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/9/98/1663_garden_Desert_with_red_light_only.png cacti and turtles] and pure blue light gives an aquatic theme with [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/23/1663_garden_Octopus_garden_with_Cueball_hand_up_and_a_black_hat_octopus.png lots of octopuses] that may also wear a black hat. For the most interesting gardens the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/15/1663_garden_Megan_Monolith_Animals_and_more.png light colors should be mixed]; see more below under [[#Effect of light|Effect of light]].\n\nIf this comic is scientifically accurate, that correlation will be based on {{w|photosynthetically active radiation}}.\n\nSome users manage to create fantastic gardens (by using lots of time on them, pruning them at the right time and changing the light and lamp position to get what they strive for). Especially one user have created a series of amazing gardens that is posted on another [https://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=114415&start=600 xkcd forum]. Here is a collection of screenshots with some of [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#Blitz_Girls_amazing_gardens|Blitz Girls amazing gardens]]!\n\nThere are three different title texts in this comic. In addition to the main one, there's also one for each of the two buttons, and one that says \"null\". This is unusual, given some of the newest interactive comics [[:Category:No title text|don't even have one title text]]. The normal one, \"Relax\", can be debated. It might be a hint to the users to just sit back and relax as their garden grows. Randall might also tease the user by giving them a garden that they need to tend to and then telling them to relax. The next two are explanations for what the two buttons in the top right corner do and only appear when the cursor hovers over them. They state \"Create new light\", explaining that this icon introduces new lamps, and \"Remove selected (delete key)\", which explains that the icon can be used to remove the selected items, such as lamps or plants. It also explains that the delete key of their keyboard can be used instead of the button.\n\n===Extra Garden pages===\nSince this comic is so complicated, extra pages have been created to include much more information than is wished for on this main page (which is already of considerable size). These pages are listed here for convenience, but they are also linked in the relevant sections below:\n\n*'''[[1663: Garden/Images]]'''. The images of items that can appear in the comic. This page is linked in the section [[#Garden items|Items in the garden]].\n\n*'''[[1663: Garden/Screen-shots]]'''. Since there are no permalink, then in order to save a particular moment of a garden a screen shot is needed. These can be posted here. This page is linked in the section [[#Saving your garden|Saving your garden]].\n\n*'''[[1663: Garden/Users gardens]]'''. A place for users of this wiki to post links to their own garden, and also for experimental gardens. This page is linked in the section [[#Saving your garden|Saving your garden]].\n\n==Functionality==\n===Saving your garden===\nThere is no [[1350#Permalink|permalink button]], as in the last two years' April Fools' Day comics. The URL is different for every garden that is loaded, but stays the same. It links to a server-side copy of the scene, which then changes depending on what the users does with their gardens. Sharing a URL will connect a new browser to the same garden session, but only the original user will be allowed to edit. The garden itself will continue to develop further from the time when the URL was copied, even if the garden is not opened in any browser. If the user doesn't keep it, it will become infested with weeds. This means that a specific moment in a garden's life has to be saved as an image for future references.\n\nBelow is an example garden [https://www.xkcd.com/1663/#0d11a2c8-fa8f-11e5-8001-42010a8e000e linked by ID] versus the same garden. Other [[1663: Garden/Users gardens|user gardens]] can be found on the link. Creating different browser windows or tabs pointing to the same URL will allow you to edit from either window. linden.xkcd.com holds all the data; the UUID just corresponds to your access key, held in your browser's local storage.\n*In the original [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7f/1663_garden_tree_turtle_birdbath.png screenshot from April 4th] from when the URL was created\n*In a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7c/1663_garden_Flying_birds_deer_gate_with_cactus_turtles_snake_etc.png screenshot from April 5th] the day after.\n*Here [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5a/1663_garden_Pruned_garden_with_birds_deer_gate_cactus_turtles_snake_gate.png example] after the user pruned the garden in the examples.\n\nSince the URLs are changing, the only way to save a particular garden is to save an image of the current garden. Alternatively, by deleting all lamps (or changing them to laser beams or turning them upwards) then no new growth will occur -- but then the garden will no longer develop. In Edge, Firefox and Chrome, the image plus light cones but minus lamps and icons elements, can be saved by right clicking in the image. They do not always save in the same way as some browsers saves the part of the background without any light cones as white, and other save it as no background, in which case it may render black, basically hiding any black items outside the light. For those images, it depends on which viewer is used to see the image, if everything can be seen or only that in the light cones. See examples of how it looks with black background in these two color maps collections using [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/50/1663_garden_Single_colors.png a single lamp] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/9/90/1663_garden_Three_colors.png three lamps]. See more details about how these [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#Color_maps|colored maps]] have been made. See also two examples of saved images as they are here on explain xkcd [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#Saved_image_from_xkcd|here]].\n\nAn image of the whole screen can be captured by pressing the PrtScn (Print Screen) key on the keyboard and then pasting the content into a blank image in an image-editing program. An even better solution is to use a tool like {{w|Snipping Tool}} which can take the part of the screen that are relevant. This is how most of the [[1663: Garden/Screen-shots|screen shots]] for this explanation has been acquired. In both ways, the lamps and icons can also be displayed, which is not an option with saved images.\n\n===Lamps and colors===\n[[File:1663 garden Numbered color scale 1-17.png|right]]The color control moves in a smooth gradient between colors along the spectrum, without any set positions. There are [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/50/1663_garden_Single_colors.png nine different colors] a single lamp emits, and many more colors are evident when [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/9/90/1663_garden_Three_colors.png two or three lamps overlap]. However, small half-step changes in the color setting can affect the garden, even if there's no visible change in the colored light. Because there is another color setting between those nine visible colors, there are a total of 17 different colors. An experiment with such 17 settings for just one lamp with one color can be found [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#One_lamp_one_color|here]]. Several unique elements only seem to appear using some of the eight half-colors, such as the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/3f/1663_garden_One_color_Between_orange_red_and_red_First_thing_Mars_rover.png Mars rover] and [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1b/1663_garden_One_color_Between_Light_yellow_and_yellow_First_thing_stilts_right.png Stilts girl].\n\n*Additional lamps, up to a total of three lamps, can be added by clicking the black plus lamp icon along the right of the window.\n*Lamps can be removed by clicking to select a lamp, then clicking the red X icon along the right of the window, or pressing the Delete or Backspace key on the keyboard. All lights can be deleted.\n*The position of the lamp can be moved by clicking and dragging the lamp within the scene.\n*The angle and area of the light cone emitted by the lamp can be changed by [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/0/09/Garden_Red_Lamp_screen_shot.png clicking to select the lamp and to reveal the red control triangle]. Rotating the control triangle around the lamp will change the aim of the lamp to point in the direction of the triangle, dragging the control triangle towards the lamp will [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/cc/1663_garden_One_color_Light_blue.png widen the beam], and dragging the control triangle towards away from the lamp will [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5a/1663_garden_Pruned_garden_with_birds_deer_gate_cactus_turtles_snake_gate.png narrow the beam].\n*The color emitted by the lamp can be changed by clicking the lamp to reveal the colored control dot, and by rotating the dot around the lamp. The small color control circle changes color to match the color of the lamps beam of light. new lights default to a center position, emitting a pale green. rotating the control right changes the color to yellow, orange, and finally red, and rotating the control left changes the color to white, then blue.\n\n[[#Bugs and hacks|The debugger]] reveals that each light has a \"temp\" property, which ranges from 0 (red) to 1 (blue). The default setting is 0.5 (light yellow). The RGB color corresponding to \"temp\" is determined by this function in linden.js:\n::<tt>function u(t){return.32>t?[1,.5+.5*t/.32,.5]:.64>t?[1,1,.5+.5*(t-.32)/.32]:[.75+.25*(1-t)/.36,.75+.25*(1-t)/.36,1]}</tt>\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"plainlinks\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! #\n!

For instance, areas under lights set to the outer position or the starting position was very different. Soon after the release of the comic, some research into a single lamp with unchaining light, that covering the whole light range split into 17 divisions was undertaken.

There are some indications that it is not a clear mix as pure blue together with pure red, does not seem to produce neither Octopuses or desert theme. If there are any items that can only grow under a mix of light this has not been proven. Most objects that can grow directly from the ground, has been observed in the experimental single color gardens mentioned above. But there may be items that needs to grow on top of other objects, and these may require a change of color from what the base needs. And thus they will not appear under one color light. Possible examples of these items could be:\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/f3/Garden_Desk_lamp.png Desk lamp] (needing some kind of platform forming in another color range like the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/ee/Garden_Tall_platform.png tall platform], yellow or the small [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/11/Garden_Platform_1.png platform], orange).\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/88/Garden_Giant_Planter.png Giant Planter] (needing for instance a [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/c4/Garden_PlatformColumn_3.png platform column], light blue light]\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e0/Garden_lamp-topper.png Lamp pole tops] (needing [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/81/Garden_Lamppost_1.png lamp poles] forming under orange light)\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a4/Garden_Flower_bloom_1.png Flower blooms] (any type) (needing [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d1/Garden_Flower_segment_1.png flower segments], several colors)\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7e/Garden_Actual_flying_fish_1.png Actual flying fish] (needing bird raiser, orange light)\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5d/Garden_Saucer.png Flying saucer] (needing bird raiser, orange light)\n\nWhat happens when using only one color (other than the two outer points red and blue and the starting light yellow color) has been explored in great depth in no less than two different [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#One_lamp_one_color|One lamp one color]] experiments with [[1663:_Garden/Users_gardens#Locked_gardens_only_for_explanation_use|51 gardens]] created using 17 different color settings.\n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/27/1663_garden_One_color_Between_blue_and_light_blue_6d.png Blue light] (just right of pure blue) creates a landscape with stones forming cairns, together with monoliths, both kinds of Cueballs (with black hat on the standing one) and still octopuses. \n\n* [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/75/1663_garden_One_color_Light_blue_9d.png Light blue light] (just a little farther from pure blue than above), the octopuses disappear, but the rest remains the same, although boats and wadding bird now appear in the water, and still both [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/a/a6/1663_garden_Color_03_5d.png Cueballs] can occur.

If it is very close to red the Mars rover appears (as in the example above). If it is a little longer from red, the platforms can form, which can then act as a catalyst for growth and create [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/58/1663_garden_One_color_Orange_red_9d.png large towers] on top of cactus's.\n\nUnder several conditions, nothing seems to be able to grow. If no lamps are pointing towards the ground for instance because:\n* All [https://xkcd.com/1663/#21374f9e-fbbd-11e5-8001-42010a8e0015 lamps are deleted].\n\n* The [https://xkcd.com/1663/#4896b678-fbbe-11e5-8001-42010a8e0011 beam is laser thin.]\n\n* The lamps points towards the sky without [https://www.xkcd.com/1663/#6a6a7be0-fbbe-11e5-800d-42010a8e0008 touching the ground.]\n\n* The lamps are [https://xkcd.com/1663/#c75991f6-fbbe-11e5-8001-42010a8e0011 below the ground pointing down]. (In this case the one over the pond was not far enough down and a single water plant has formed anyway.)\n\nOn the other hand, if the lamps are below the ground but pointing up, it can result in growth well enough (as shown in this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/7c/1663_garden_Different_light_from_below_the_ground.png first example] and this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/3a/1663_garden_Yellow_light_from_below_the_ground.png second example]). It was believed that if the lamps where very close to the ground pointing straight down there would be no growth. However, this can be because only a very small area is illuminated. In this [https://www.xkcd.com/1663/#9733dff4-fbbe-11e5-8001-42010a8e0012 example] there are turtles under the red light in the pond, plants under the yellow and octopus, column and Cueball under the blue (from the time that columns could appear under pure blue light). Similar in this [https://xkcd.com/1663/#357a48d8-fbbf-11e5-8019-42010a8e0006 example] there are octopus (in the pond), deer/plants and a cactus from even lower lamps. Of course, the lamp has to be so high as not to be underground as mentioned above.\nAlso, if lamps point towards the ground there can still only grow something from the ground [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/3e/1663_garden_Two_light_on_small_area_nothing_outside_the_light.png where the light touches]. The growth can move outside the light cones up in the air, but the base has to be within a well-lit area.\n\nSimilar with items that can grow new things on top of them like tree trunks or platforms, this will only happen if light shines on the relevant places. For instance, the tall tree trunks can easily grow outside a light cone. Then leaves and branches will [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e9/1663_garden_One_color_Between_Light_yellow_and_yellow_3d.png only grow below] the point where the light hits. Similar with platform, that [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/3e/1663_garden_One_color_Yellow_2d.png grows partially outside] the light cone. More items will only appear where this lamp still hits the platform.\n\nOne exemption to the rule mentioned here seems to be the bird raisers, used to hold anything that flies up in the air. The bird raiser itself needs to grow from either another bird riser or from a bird riser root (which in the end holds all bird raisers). This root has to have light on the ground to grow and thus have light on it self. But from the top of the bird raisers growing from such a root, items are able to grow even if the tip pf the bird raiser is not in the light. Thus, flying items can appear to grow where there has [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/4f/1663_garden_One_color_Between_orange_and_orange_red_8d.png never been light]! Of course lights can be moved and changed without destroying what has already grown there (or so it seems). So a tended garden cannot be used to determine this. This is why some [[1663:_Garden/Users_gardens#Locked_gardens_only_for_explanation_use|locked gardens]] have been set up where there will be no changes ever. Examples from above has mainly been taken from screen shots of these locked gardens. See much more about bird raisers in the [[#Helper_structures|table below]]!\n\nAfter a few weeks, growth not only seems to appear when the garden is actively running in a browser window, possibly only in the original user's browser. There continued to appear new items for about 8 days after the release, such as many new items and animals like the columns, the owls, tulips and lightning poles. A last burst of new animals occurred about a week after release (either 11th or 12th of April). This burst included the following animals: Herons, Wadding birds, Sharks fins, jumping fish and flying fish plus actual flying fish (flying without water), armadillos and no less than 12 different [[#Linsang (cat-like animal)|linsang (cat-like animals)]].\n\nHowever, it also seems to change what might appear, so that the result of a particular color will change dramatically, not only by adding new, but also by not growing what used to be. A clear example of this is that for the first half week pure blue light resulted in lots of octopuses all along the ground and also Cueballs cheeking for rain. Later, columns appeared, but after a week the growth rate under blue light almost stopped, and it seems that octopuses now only grow over the pond to the left, and much less Cueball and no columns under that color. See more details about it in [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#Growth_speed_vs_blue_light|Growth speed vs blue light]].\n\nGrown items may be highlighted by clicking on them. Selected grown items will be highlighted with a red circle, and appear slightly lighter then other items. Grown items may be \"pruned\" by the red X icon along the right of the window, or pressing the Delete key on the keyboard. Some items (such as the large tree) can be deleted in minor parts by selecting a branch or smaller set of leaves without deleting the entire tree. See the images (with links to xkcd) of all 250 items that can appear, in the [[#Garden items|list of garden items]].\n\nThe beam produced by each lamp is normally restricted to spread between 0&deg; (which results in no growth) and 95&deg;.

They only seem to appear in the orange color range. The riser is invisible (white) and would have to have a background to be seen (both versions are shown to the left). This will never be the case in the garden as the raiser does not show up in front of other black items. However, the risers can be seen using the [[#Bugs and hacks|debug mode]], and this is used as the example to the right.\n\nAlso using the debug mode on this [https://www.xkcd.com/1663/#1e853af8-055f-11e6-8001-42010a8e000f garden] the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e0/1663_garden_Color_13_2_5d_debug_with_count.png number of items can be counted] as shown in the link.  From this link it is clear that there are three bird risers attached to two of the seven bird riser roots. Here, only single bird risers are displayed, but they can be connected see below.\n\nThe root can often be seen on the ground, but it can be hidden behind other objects. The root has the first short part of a bird riser above the root, which is invisible (by any means). The bird riser takes hold at the top of this invisible part. That it is there can best be seen by putting a frame around the image of the root, to see that it is twice as high as the root itself. Such an image is also shown to the left. (But the end can also be seen in the debug mode images). The riser are used to make items fly in the air. I.e. the five types of flying birds, the saucer, flying Megan and the two \"actual flying fish\", can attach them selves to the end of a bird riser.\n\nWhereas the risers need to have a root to begin, then more risers can attach to the end already existing risers, thus getting much higher up in the air than one riser (all the way up!).\n\nRisers can have any angles to each others, even going further down, which can explain birds and other flying objects touching the ground (even making an object be situated partially beneath the ground, like [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/c/cf/1663_garden_One_color_Orange_6d.png this flying Megan] from this [https://xkcd.com/1663/#0d6bca62-fcf3-11e5-8019-42010a8e0005 garden] or maybe even outside the frame, see last example below).\n\nAs opposed to anything else the light that creates a bird (or other flying item) does not need to touch the actually bird, but rather the place from where the bird riser is rooted. This indicates that the birds etc. can grow from light touching the base of the risers rather than the tip.\nSince many bird risers can grow in layers above the first riser it is clear that the bird riser does not appear with a bird on them in one go! There are many examples with [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/48/1663_garden_One_color_Orange_9d.png birds] or [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/4f/1663_garden_One_color_Between_orange_and_orange_red_8d.png flying Megan] \"growing\" outside the light, where no light ever was, as seen from some of the [[1663:_Garden/Users_gardens#Locked_gardens_only_for_explanation_use|locked experimental gardens]].\nWhen selecting a bird riser root all bird risers and all flying things connected to these will also be selected (and deleted if the root is deleted). These are two examples from the same [https://xkcd.com/1663/#578b80bc-fd96-11e5-8001-42010a8e000a garden] where two different roots have been selected:\n*In this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b9/1663_garden_14_Between_orange_and_orange_red_15d_selected_bird_riser_root.png example] the selected root is hidden by the tulip in the red circle. Seven birds are selected both right and left of this root. (Two of them on top of each other).\n*In this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/2/27/1663_garden_14_Between_orange_and_orange_red_15d_selected_bird_riser_root_Megan.png example] the root in the red circle is completely hidden by turtles etc. It connects to three birds and one flying Megan, showing that it is the bird riser roots that also connect to her.\n*In this next example [https://xkcd.com/1663/#59246c86-fcce-11e5-8001-42010a8e0010 garden] the links between a root and four birds are displayed in detail.\n*The [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/73/1663_garden_SF_final.png first image] is just the normal garden view screen-shot (lamps deleted). 10 birds can be seen; there are six birds over the lamp post; two near the ground under the high platform; one near the right crown of the tree; and one to the left that looks like it is a part of the linsang. Several bird riser roots (at least five) can be seen on the ground from the middle of the platform and right past the cat (two under it) and then at the sign.\n*In the [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/8d/1663_garden_SF_final_selected.png second image] the root at the foot of the Sale sign has been selected.

In the last [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/3/35/1663_garden_SF_final_debug_drawing.png fourth image] the links between the root and the four birds have been indicated. A zero (0) has been written under the root. Then 1 indicates the single bird riser that goes to the right bird over the lamp post. Bird riser 2, 3 and 4 connect to each other from the root up to the highest bird right of the crown. Then bird riser 5 goes from that to the bird near the linsang left of the tree, and finally bird riser 6 and 7 goes straight back and down to the lowest bird near the ground. \n\nSeveral bird risers go beneath the ground, which also sometimes happens with flying Megan. In this last example it is made clear that birds can then appear either under ground (or under the top of other structures blocking their view) or even totally outside the frame (as indicated above the bird risers seem to be able to sprout items outside the cones of light, as long as they grow in the light them selves). The proof for this comes in this [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/16/1663_garden_Color_13_5d_debug_with_count.png example] with the debug version of this [https://www.xkcd.com/1663/#fa1b5c92-055e-11e6-8001-42010a8e000f garden] showing the count.

At the edges there are some rocks or stones raising the level from the general level through the center of the panel. Above the middle, a little more than halfway to the top of the panel, is a light bulb sitting inside a lamp that reminds of the desk lamp from the movie Luxo Jr. The lamp shines a yellow light down on the landscape in a broad cone that jus reaches the first rock to the left, but not those to the right. The lamp just hovers in the air. In the top right corner are two gray icons. The top one has a black frame and shows an image of a lamp, tilted left as opposed to the straight position of the lamp in the image. There is a + sign below in the left corner. The second icon without a frame has a large white cross in the middle.]\n\n:[This is a web applet and using the \"+ lamp\" icon two more lamps can be added getting up to three. They are all adjustable both regarding position, direction, color of light and beam width. When selecting a lamp a red circle appear around it with a small circle on top that can be used to control the light color from blue to the left to red to the right. In front is a red arrow that can turn the lamp and it can also be used to change the beam width by pulling it away from the lamp or pushing it back. The lamps can be moved by just clicking on it and moving it. The other icon with a X can be used to remove the lamps (and later any object that appear in the garden). When any object is selected there is a red circle around it. When this is done the gray cross icon becomes red and can the be used to delete the selected item. When no item is selected (either because it is deleted, or by clicking in a part of the screen with no items), then the cross icon turns gray again. When all three lamps are on, then the \"+ lamp\" icon is faded out.]\n\n:[If you wait (or relax, as in the first title text), then a plant will grow or animals, humans and other items may appear. This could be birds, snakes, octopuses or turtles, Megan or Cueball or a birdbath, a monolith or a tall gate just as a few examples. Most of the items appear in one go, but at least the largest trees grow up with a big stem first and then adds parts later with leaves or empty branches. Also one item may appear on top of another item and for instance birds may fly in the air.]\n\n:[There is but two words in the entire comic, which appears when you grow a sign:]\n:Sign: Sale\n\n==Trivia==\n===April Fools' Day comics<span id=\"Monday 4th of April release\"></span>===\nAs the [[Header text#2016-04-01_-_April_1st_comic_-_technical_difficulties|header text for this comic]] pointed out, it was supposed to be released on Friday 1st and be an [[April Fools' Day comics|April Fools' Day comic]]. This comic did actually come out on Sunday night, as promised in the third message about release, but it was initially [[#Bugs and hacks|riddled with issues]]. It's also regarded as the Friday comic, even in the last update before the release, which was two days after April 1st. This was a very complex comic to create, and it's likely that Randall had problems while making it. On the second day, several bugs were fixed over time, but many minor issues were still present.\n\nThere are several reasons to believe that Randall would have preferred the comic to get out on Friday April 1st. Apart from it being a time-consuming comic that in itself is April Fools' Day comics material, then by getting it out Friday this special comic, which he obviously has spent a lot of time to prepare, would have had one more day as the first comic. Also, getting it out before a weekend would have let many more users spend time looking at their garden. Now many would not spend enough time to appreciate the comic, as it came out right when the new work week began. This is a very complicated comic that just to get to understand how to really use it could take a days' time, as the whole [[#Functionality|functionality]] of the comic is much more complex than similar comics, such as [[1608: Hoverboard]]. Additionally, before the following weekend, two more comics were released, taking some of the focus away from this one. Of course, diehard [[xkcd]] fans won't easily forget this one, but many fans may only come by in the weekend and miss this comic.\n\nDue to delayed launch, the Wednesday comic [[1662: Jack and Jill]] got more attention than it would usually have had. This comic thus turned into the Monday release instead, as no other comic was released later that Monday, as this would have taken attention away from this very special comic. However, Randall called this comic an \"April 1st comic\" and later \"the Friday comic\" in the [[#Header text|header text]] displayed at the top of xkcd when he explained why the Friday comic hadn't come out. The header text continued to stay at the top and changed two more times until the release. There were thus only two comics released in the week before this Monday, which may be the first time since xkcd went live on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] in 2006.\n\n===Header text===\nThere have been different [[Header text|header texts]] displayed from Friday until the comic was released. The header text continued to change regularly after the comic's release in regard to this comic at least until next Friday (April 8th). Links are given when possible to a [[1663:_Garden/Screen-shots#Screen-shots_of_header_text|screen shots]] on the word ''message'' and to a webarchive in another link when both are available.\n\nOn Friday, April 1st, 2016, the xkcd website changed to a new [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/81/1663_garden_April_1st_comic_is_currently_experiencing_technical_difficulties.png message] where the standard message \"XKCD updates every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\" usually is.
