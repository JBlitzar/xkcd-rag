I couldn't read it with a straight face.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe {{w|G-Spot}} is, as the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8439000.stm BBC has quoted] saying in the title text, an elusive erogenous zone some women claim to have that can be stimulated to enhance their sexual experience. \n\nIn this comic, a live press conference has been held due to a peer-reviewed study suggesting the G-Spot may not exist. But the press have entered the wrong meeting where [[Cueball]] (the researcher) has performed a study on solar cells. So initially he tries to claim that he has not been researching the G-Spot. But he also ends up shamefully admitting that he has tried but failed finding it anyway. That is, he has had difficulty making his lover orgasm through the use of G-spot stimulation.\n\nIn the title text [[Randall]] notes that he could not read the lead from the BBC story: ''The elusive erogenous zone said to exist in some women may be a myth, say researchers who have hunted for it.'' with a straight face. This is probably because Randall assumes that \"hunted for it\" means the researchers had frequent sexual intercourse.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[To the left of the main comic there is an explanation text without a frame around it:]\n:A study published in the journal of sexual medicine suggests that the g-spot may not actually exist.\n:We go live to the researchers' press conference:\n\n:[Two reporters with microphones, Ponytail and a Cueball-like guy, stand below a podium where Cueball stands behind a lectern. Ponytail reach out with her microphone towards Cueball:]\n:Ponytail: Is it true you've been unable to find evidence that the G-spot exists?\n\n:[Zoom in on Cueball and the top of the lectern:]\n:Cueball: My research is in solar cells. I think you have the wrong press conference.\n\n:[Beat panel with the same view as before.]\n\n:[Same view but now Cueball hangs his head. Smaller text.]\n:Cueball: But... yes.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Solar power]]"
