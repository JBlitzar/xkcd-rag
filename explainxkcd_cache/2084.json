Maybe the trick is a catchy rhyme; the '5th of November' thing is still going strong over 400 years later.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThe United States Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii was {{w|Attack on Pearl Harbor| attacked in 1941}}, and is credited with starting the United States' involvement in World War II. The then US president, {{w|Franklin D. Roosevelt}} (FDR), issued a speech to the American people which begins with the line \"Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, {{w|Infamy Speech| a date which will live in infamy...}}\". Whenever [[Randall]] writes \"December\" he feels compelled to complete the line, a mistake which is visible in this comic.\n\nThis may be a parody of a more common type of error in which people writing dates during January (particularly early in the month) accidentally write the previous year instead of the current one because the previous year number is an established pattern while the new one is a recent change.\n\nThe title text confuses the date of the northern hemisphere summer solstice (June 21st) with the date of the {{w|365 Crete earthquake}} that happened on July 21st 365 CE.  The earthquake had a magnitude of at least 8.0 which caused widespread destruction across the Eastern Mediterranean.  Then it mentions {{w|Guy Fawkes Night}}, the anniversary of the famous failed attempt to bomb the {{w|Parliament of England|English parliament}} on the night of November 5th, 1605. The latter event is immortalized in the rhyme \"remember remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder, treason, and plot\", the former event less so.\n\nRandall also may be suggesting that Roosevelt implied the degree of \"infamy\" of an event can be measured by how long its date is remembered. Pearl Harbor resulted in 2,458 deaths and obviously extensive damage to a military base and fleet. It had been remembered for 77 years, as of the comic's publication. The earthquake of 365 CE resulted in an estimated 230,000 killed and numerous cities severely damaged or destroyed. Randall states it was remembered for a few centuries. The Gunpowder Plot resulted in the death of a couple of conspirators and no notable damage. It has been remembered, at least in song, for \"over 400 years\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Close-up of a form.
