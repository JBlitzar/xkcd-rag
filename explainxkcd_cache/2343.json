A straight line is farthest to the \"more dangerous\" side; however, the straight line does not appear to be any thicker or thinner, or pointier, than any of the other lines that would make it more \"useful\" (It should be noted that this chart seems to fall afoul of what {{w|Eliezer Yudkowsky}} (who also wrote HPMoR) calls the ''intent to kill'': that humans tend to define \"winning a fight\" and \"useful\" as causing some form of bodily harm on their opponent despite survival and purely defensive strategies being an equally valid goals.).\n\nBelow the chart, with the symbols listed in order of usefulness, eight characters wield eight of the symbols. See the table below for the meaning of each symbol.\n\nThe comic invokes {{w|Surreal humour|surreal humor}} by suggesting that mathematical symbols could be handled as physical objects in the real world. Another component of the humor is the implication that it is useful to prepare to use mathematical symbols in a fight, even though mathematicians, who use mathematical symbols, usually do not conduct their debates violently (though some stories suggest that {{w|Hippasus}} was killed by his fellow Pythagoreans for his proof that irrational numbers exist), and even if they did, they wouldn't use large reproductions of their symbols as weapons.\n\nNote that [[Black Hat]] and [[Danish]] are using two of the most useful symbols, and appear to have teamed up against their opponents, resulting in an unfair advantage they would both absolutely exploit.\n\nThe title text refers to a {{w|treble clef}}, which is not a mathematical symbol but rather a {{w|List of musical symbols|musical symbol}}. The note of concern in the text suggests musical symbols may be viewed in such fights as exotic or especially dangerous. See also the last entry in the table below.\n\nHere is a list of symbols and their explanation, from left to right (by rightmost edge) <!-- Where two symbols had similar right-most edges, the overlay grid on an ASUS pro-art display was used to decide which one went further right.-->: \n<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ℝ θ ∅ ∞  > ∪ ∝ ∈ ∀ π ∂ + ≠ Ψ # ~ △ ζ ⇒ ⋅ ℵ Γ ''ρ'' √ → ∮ ∫ ⊥  ⇀ ––</span>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Symbol\n! Meaning\n! Notes on using in a fight\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ℝ</span>\n|The set of {{w|real number}}s\n|[[Megan]] seems to be struggling with a giant version of this symbol because of its weight. A very strong person might find it slightly more useful as a bludgeon.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  θ</span>\n|{{w|Theta#Mathematics and science|Theta}}\n|This symbol is not very sharp, and [[White Hat]] is unable to use it in combat. It would not work as a good shield due to the hole in the symbol, but it possibly could be thrown. (The later version of Xena's chakram had a bar in the middle.)\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∅</span>\n|{{w|Empty set}}\n|Similarly shaped to theta, but identified as being slightly more useful, presumably because the parts of the bar that extend beyond the circle can be used as thrusting weapons. Alternatively, the round nature of the symbol makes it easier to handle for defense, by holding on to the line and using the edge of the circular part to block.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∞</span>\n|{{w|Infinity}}\n|Could be gripped between the rings and used as a blunt instrument.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ></span>\n|{{w|Inequality (mathematics)|Greater than}}\n|Could be used to thrust with the point, but lacks a grip by which to do so.  If held by one leg, the angle and balance is wrong to use it as a pick.  Could also be used as a {{w|boomerang}}.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∪</span>\n|{{w|Union (set theory)|Union}}\n|Could be used as a boomerang, which is notoriously {{tvtropes|PrecisionGuidedBoomerang|less practical in real life than in fiction}}.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∝</span>\n|{{w|Proportionality (mathematics)#Direct proportionality|Direct proportionality}} (not to be confused with lowercase {{w|Alpha#Mathematics and science|alpha}})\n|Could be brandished by the ring and used to thrust with the prongs, but the two prongs extending at 90-degree angles make thrusting motions awkward.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∈</span>\n|{{w|Element (mathematics)|Member of}} (set theory)<!--It's not the \"lunate\" lowercase {{w|Epsilon#Symbol|epsilon}} because the middle \"arm\" is not high enough-->\n|[[Cueball]] is holding this in the manner of a Klingon \"{{w|Bat'leth}}\" from the ''Star Trek'' franchise. The Bat'leth is [https://youtu.be/VsElSDXPgSA infamous] among swordfighters for being rather impractical, and that the Klingon warrior race would have been better suited using swords like humans. It seems that Randall agrees, as the ∈ is quite far on the left of the chart.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∀</span>\n|\"{{w|Universal quantification|For all}}\"\n|Could be held by the crossbar clenched in a fist, and then used as a {{w|push dagger}}, with the legs acting as a guard.  Or could be held by the legs.\nCompared to the similar Δ (delta) the point is sharper, the grip is closer to the point so it would be easier to control (keep the weapon from twisting). It is unclear why it is listed as much less effective than the delta.  Perhaps the guard legs are too long?\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  π</span>\n|{{w|Pi}}\n|Could be used as a hammer, but the two handles would make doing so impractical.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∂</span>\n|{{w|Partial derivative}} or {{w|Boundary (topology)|boundary operator}}\n|It's not clear why Randall ranks this symbol as so much less effective than the similarly-shaped 𝜌, but the curl in the \"tail\" of the ∂ would give it a shorter lever arm when swung and would disrupt the balance.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  +</span>\n|{{w|Plus and minus signs#Plus sign|Plus sign}}\n|Maybe thrown like a {{w|shuriken}}? It could also be used like {{w|Kylo Ren}}'s lightsaber.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ≠</span>\n|{{w|Inequation|Not equal to}}\n|Could be gripped by the crossbar, using the lengths to puncture. Notably, the equal sign (=) is absent from the chart, likely because the lengths are separate and would not be used as a single entity.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  Ψ</span>\n|{{w|Psi#Mathematics|Psi}}\n|It could be used as a slightly-less-functional trident or pitchfork, with a shorter handle. More particularly, it resembles a {{w|Sai (weapon)|sai}} (which, funnily enough, is close to how \"Psi\" is pronounced).\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  #</span>\n|{{w|Cardinality}}, {{w|connected sum}} (knot theory), or {{w|primorial}}.\n|[[Blondie]] uses this symbol, gripping it by two of the prongs on one side. The other three prongs could thus be swung at opponents, but being sharp on all sides would pose a threat to the user as well as the opponent.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ~</span>\n|{{w|Tilde#Mathematics|Tilde}}, meaning \"approximately\", \"equivalent\", or several transforms of a function. Also used as {{w|Negation#Notation|negation in mathematical logic}} and in many {{w|Tilde#Computer languages|programming languages}}.\n|A potentially dangerous throwing weapon.  Could also be similar to a wavy bladed dagger ({{w|Kris}}) or a sword ({{w|Flame-bladed sword}}).\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  Δ</span>\n|{{w|Delta (letter)|Delta}}\n|Could be held with one bar clenched in a fist, and then used as a {{w|push dagger}}.  It is unclear why listed as much more effective than ∀.  Also, delta could be thrown like a star.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ζ</span>\n|{{w|Zeta#Mathematics_and_science|Zeta}}\n|Could be sharpened into a scythe or curved saber, depending on the curvature and length of the 'tail' at the bottom.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ⇒</span>\n|{{w|Material conditional|Material consequence}} or {{w|logical consequence}}, meaning \"implies\"\n|The point is nice, but having two poles (or one board-like thick handle, if the shape is drawn \"closed\" at the back) would be difficult to wield.  A collection of them might make a nice defensive pike line.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ⋅</span>\n|{{w|Decimal separator|Decimal point}} or {{w|multiplication sign}}\n|Functionally a ball, and could therefore be thrown as a projectile weapon, or scattered on the ground as a trip hazard.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ℵ</span>\n|{{w|Aleph number}}\n|The irregular shape of the symbol leads to edges and points on all sides; thus it could be brandished or thrown in the manner of a shuriken.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  Γ</span>\n|Uppercase Greek letter {{w|Gamma#Uppercase|gamma}}\n|If this letter is formed with {{w|serif}}s, it could be used as an axe or hook, and if it is made {{w|sans-serif}}, it would make a powerful pick or war hammer.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ''ρ''</span>\n|{{w|Prime_constant|Italic rho}}\n|[[Ponytail]] is brandishing this symbol against [[Danish]], apparently using it like a club or hammer and striking with the curve.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  √</span>\n|{{w|Radical symbol}}\n|Randall has drawn this sign with a long overbar, which makes it useful like a {{w|Pole weapon|pole arm}}.  [[Black Hat]] has chosen this symbol in his fight against [[Hairy]].\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  →</span>\n|Implies; X→Y means that if X is true, then Y is also true\n|[[Danish]] is brandishing this symbol against Ponytail, apparently using it like a spear.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∮</span>\n|{{w|Contour integral}}\n|This symbol is drawn with a very tight center, giving it an almost identical figure to the regular integral symbol. Presumably, the added bulk for marginal additional use earns it a rating of 'less effective'.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ∫</span>\n|{{w|Integral}}\n|Could be used in the manner of a shepherd's crook, or as a {{w|Bill (weapon)|billhook}}.  Could be used as a {{w|spear thrower}}, combined with ⋅ or ⇀.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ⊥</span>\n|{{w|Up tack}} or falsum, indicating a false proposition in logic, perpendicular lines in geometry, or the bottom element in a partial order\n|Used as a {{w|war hammer}} (held by the long stem) so the opponent would be struck with either leg of the top of the T. Held by the short legs (like a wishbone), could be used as a two handed sword.\n(If tipped with a knapped stone head, it could become a {{w|Folsom point|falsum point}}.)\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ⇀</span>\n|{{w|Vector notation}}\n|Could be used as a single-barbed spear or, if held by the other end, similarly to a sabre. The multi-functionality is probably why it is listed as more useful than the 'implies' arrow.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:150%\">  ––</span>\n|{{w|Fraction#Vocabulary|Fraction bar}} (division) or {{w|Overline#Math_and_science|overline}} (complex conjugate or mean) or {{w|Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|minus sign}}.\n|[[Hairy]] is brandishing this symbol against Black Hat. The single shaft would allow it to be used in the manner of a {{w|quarterstaff}}, {{w|bō}}, or other {{w|stick-fighting}} weapon.  Of the symbols shown in the comic, Randall considers this one the most useful in a fight, presumably because of its greater reach than the vector arrow and its simplicity compared to the radix root symbol. Alternatively, could be handled like a pike, with a reach greater than that of an implication or vector arrow.\n|-\n|<span style=\"font-size:200%\">  𝄞</span>\n|{{w|Treble clef}} (title text)\n|Mentioned in the title text; this is not a mathematical symbol, but a musical symbol. The treble clef is a much more complicated symbol than those used in mathematics, hence the musician's \"confidence\" in his weapon. The curve at the bottom could be used as a hook, the upper curl could be used as a blunt weapon, and the tight curl of the center would serve as a better defensive shield than theta.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A chart is shown with 30 different symbols arranged above a line with arrows in both ends and with 17 ticks between the arrow heads. The symbols are mostly in two rows, but the first two symbols from the left do not have another symbol above them, and towards the right there are a segment with three rows of symbols.
