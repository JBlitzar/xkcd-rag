This comic compares four ravioli-shaped objects (square shaped objects with bulging cross-sections due to their filling) with some common actions associated with them. See the [[#Table of ravioli objects|table]] below.\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|NFPA 704}} diagram for hazardous materials, a diamond figure put out by the {{w|National Fire Protection Association}} showing four kinds of fire hazards. A {{wiktionary|raviolo}} that touched all four quadrants would be a health hazard, fire hazard, and demonstrate (chemical) reactivity, and have some other miscellaneous hazard(s). The NFPA diamond was previously mentioned in [[2638: Extended NFPA Hazard Diamond]].\n\n===Table of ravioli objects===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"background:#E6C3C3;\"\n! Ravioli-Shaped Objects\n! scope=\"col\"| Eat with a fork\n! scope=\"col\"| Rest your head on\n! scope=\"col\"| Puncture and slurp\n! scope=\"col\"| Install in your phone\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Ravioli}}\n| style=\"background:#C5E6C3;\"|Ravioli pasta would indeed be suitable to be eaten with a fork, as shown.\n|Ravioli pasta is not structurally strong enough to support the weight of a human head while reclining, and would break and spill its filling over one's head and the object one is resting on. It may also be covered in sauce, adding to the general mess.\n|style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|If the ravioli filling is fluid enough, one could slurp it out with a straw. This would waste the pasta component, if it were not eaten afterwards.\n|Phones are not meant to run on ravioli. Stuffing a phone with a raviolo would cause it to break as shown, spilling the filling through the phone, which is a terrible idea.\n\nThere is a mobile app named Ravioli, but it is unlikely that Randall had that in his mind.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Throw pillow}}\n|Throw pillows are made of cloth and are inedible, whether one uses a fork or not.\n| style=\"background:#C5E6C3;\"|A throw pillow is meant to be used as head support while reclining on furniture.\n|Throw pillows do not usually have liquids inside them. Hence, Cueball finds, to his dismay, that it's empty.\n|Throw pillows are significantly bigger than phones and as such can't fit inside them, nor can typical pillows power them. As depicted, the attempt to force a pillow inside the phone has split the latter in half; the top half of the phone is visible on top of the pillow, and a bit of the bottom half can be seen beneath it.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| {{w|Capri Sun}}\n|While the juice is indeed edible, it's practically impossible to consume liquids holding only a fork, especially when it's inside of a plastic sack. All this accomplishes is piercing the pouch and spilling the liquid all over Cueball.\n|style=\"background:#FBF8CE;\"|A Capri Sun would serve as a waterbed of sorts, and wouldn't be unduly uncomfortable in a pinch. However, it's still possible that the pouch could rupture and leave you with a sticky head and no support.\n|style=\"background:#C5E6C3;\"|Capri Suns are meant to be drunk like this, and are enjoyed by many.{{citation needed}}\n|The phone shown is surrounded by spilled Capri Sun, implying that the attempt to force the two together punctured the pouch. The resulting spillage would most likely just result in the surface of the phone becoming annoyingly sticky, but if the liquid managed to get inside the phone (especially if the cover had been removed to try to put it in the compartment that usually holds the battery) it could cause a more significant and difficult to clean mess. Once actual power is provided (either an actual battery being subsequently used or the device offered external power by cable or inductance charger), the remaining residue could cause any number of further faults, and perhaps even critical component damage.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Bulging {{w|Lithium-ion battery|Lithium Battery}}\n|Bulging lithium batteries are explosive hazards and should not be punctured lest they explode. Additionally the contents of the battery are toxic if one were to somehow manage to eat the burning bits of the battery.\n|A lithium battery is a small, hard object, and a bulging one is no exception. Since the bulging comes from a buildup of heat and gas, (the primary gases being hydrogen and carbon dioxide), it would also be a constant fire hazard, which would not be conducive to relaxation.{{cn}} Lithium battery themed throw pillows, which bulge similarly to such batteries, do exist as a novelty item. Notably, these types of batteries are often referred to as \"spicy pillows\".\n|Similarly to the 'eat with a fork' example, puncturing a bulging lithium battery is a bad idea.\n|A bulging lithium battery ''could'' be installed in a phone, if one is willing to break the phone a bit (like the screen in the comic) to accommodate the bulging of the battery. More commonly, bulging batteries form inside the phone itself; if you don't usually have reason to charge or store it separately, you might only notice the problem when it causes the case or screen (shown as partly cracked, in the image) to distort significantly. In [[1422: My Phone is Dying]], [[Beret Guy]]'s phone is expanding. Although in his case it is not the normal bulging battery that causes this.\nUpon noticing the bulging of a battery, it is strongly suggested that you uninstall it from the device it is in. It is at least no longer good at holding/delivering its power, and may even become at least as {{w|Lithium-ion battery#Fire hazard|hazardous}} as when used in all the other scenarios, so you should [https://www.reading.ac.uk/health-safety-services/fire-safety/lithium-battery-information/i-have-a-swollen-lithium-ion-battery-what-should-i-do ignore it at your peril].\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A 4x4 grid of squares.

This square may have been marked in green because, although putting a bulging battery in a mobile phone is not normal usage, it is a situation that can ''arise'' from normal usage when a \"healthy\" battery begins to fail. One other suggestion was that this was an [[:Category:xkcd Phones|xkcd phone]], and a dodgy battery is part of a 'feature', such as an 'integrated hand warmer' or 'dynamic expansion').\n\nMore likely, it was just because Randall automatically went with the default association of \"Row N is appopriate for Column N\", as is his [[:Category:Confusion matrices|usual design]] for these comics, to which he adds adjustments for other surprises, exceptions and outright jokes. \n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Confusion matrices]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Phones]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
