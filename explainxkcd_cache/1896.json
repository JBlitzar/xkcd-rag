Active ingredients are the actual medicine, while inactive ingredients -- such as preservatives, dyes, or binders -- are added to dilute the active ingredient to a healthy level and help the body absorb the dose of active ingredient. \n\n[[Randall]] thus presents a pack of {{w|Common cold|cold}} medicine that has \"Active Ingredients Only\". It has six active ingredients and no inactive ingredients. This might be a spoof of the current trend of advertising food as containing \"no additives and no preservatives\".\n\nCold medicines are commonly packaged in blister packs, with each dose contained separately, and vegans commonly open up gelatin capsules and discard the capsule, ingesting only the contents of the pill{{actual citation needed}} (note that this may '''not be safe'''. Please consult your pharmacist or doctor before doing this).  By removing the inactive ingredients of the gelatin and the requirement to open it up, the slogan ''We're not here to waste your time'', is justified.  \n\nThe slogan is a registered {{w|trademark}} (®) while the product name is a common law or unregistered trademark (™). This means that the slogan likely stays the same, while the product name changes from time to time.\n\nIn the title text, the medicine company promises their product \"Contains the active ingredients from all competing cold medicines, plus the medicines for headaches, arthritis, insomnia, indigestion, and more, because who wants THOSE things?\" This may be  be a follow-up (or a wish from Randall) after [[1618: Cold Medicine]], where [[Cueball]] wishes to try all possible types of cold medicine at once. The provided justification for combining all these medications is simple: These medicines cure unpleasant symptoms, so taking them all must be a good thing. What this ignores is that taking medicine intended to solve symptoms one doesn't have can be potentially harmful, and would likely be unavoidable for this product's consumers unless they are suffering from all these conditions simultaneously. Furthermore, mixing medications can often lead to unintended reactions and side effects, and is typically advised against. \n\nAnother joke is that popular cold medicines contain no antiviral ingredients at all, and treat symptoms only -- while it might make your runny nose less runny, it will do just as much to clear the rhinovirus causing your runny nose as a sugar pill. This part of the comic may be a follow-up to [[1526: Placebo Blocker]], where a sugar pill is offered to treat a headache.\n\nA secondary joke is by claiming the active ingredients from all \"competing\" cold medicines, the company producing this \"Active Ingredients Only\" may choose whom they say they are competing against.  Some cold medications treat only pain and fever, for example, and do nothing for cough, congestion, runny nose and sneezing.  Doctors recommend medicines which aid for the particular symptoms of the cold one is experiencing.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A picture of a pack of cold medicine.
