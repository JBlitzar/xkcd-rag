He acknowledges that the hobby is useless, but relaxing. In contrast, Megan contemplates one of her own daily activities: reading online comments on news articles. Realizing that it is an equally pointless, but presumably much less relaxing activity, she joins Beret Guy in throwing rocks at his leaf boat.\n\nIt is an unfortunate property of news articles that their comments become dominated by those which are [http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/some-news-sites-cracking-down-on-over-the-top-comments/2014/05/07/4bc90958-d619-11e3-95d3-3bcd77cd4e11_story.html deliberately offensive or devolve into flame wars]. An additional metaphor may compare the article to the leaf boat while comparing the thrown stones to the flaming comments, essentially taking this most likely carefully constructed, fragile and perhaps beautiful creation (article or leaf boat) and lobbing offenses (comments or thrown stones) at it until it is dragged into the abyss (Internet \"graveyard\" or pond).\n\nThe title text makes it clear that they hit the leaf with a stone. The rest is a pun on the name of the 11th century Viking explorer {{w|Leif Erikson}}, who was believed to have been {{w|European_colonization_of_the_Americas|the first European}} to discover and settle North America, which he named \"{{w|Vinland}}\", at the time this comic was released.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Beret Guy is throwing a rock in the water while talking to Megan who walks down to him.]\n:Beret Guy: Every day I make a little leaf boat, then throw rocks until it sinks or floats away.\n\n:[Rock lands in water, near a leaf boat.]\n:Rock: '''Plunk'''\n:Beret Guy: It's pointless, but at least it's relaxing.\n\n:[Megan and Beret Guy are both holding rocks.
