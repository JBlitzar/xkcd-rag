These major events resulted in Harris replacing Biden as one of the top two candidates for {{w|President of the United States|President}} in the 2024 election, which she eventually lost.\n\nThis comic features a three-way {{w|Venn diagram}} (which [[2721: Euler Diagrams|is also an Euler diagram]]). The three circles represent eligibility for US presidency, ability to do a good job as the US president, and love for Venn diagrams:\n\n# '''Good President:''' [[Randall]] believes Harris would be a good president and implies as much, while making the reasonable assumption that he would not be. On the day this comic was published, a top Internet conversation topic was people's opinions of Harris, given the surprise nature of her candidacy, so Randall is adding in his opinion.\n# '''Eligibility:''' According to Article II of the {{w|US Constitution}}, someone is {{w|President_of_the_United_States#Eligibility|eligible for the presidency}} if they are a natural-born citizen of the United States, are at least 35 years old, and are a resident in the United States for at least 14 years. Both Randall Munroe and Kamala Harris meet these qualifications.\n# '''Vocal Venn diagram affection:''' Harris' affection for Venn diagrams is something of a meme, and has been used by her in her campaign [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-campaign-memes-gen-z-b2583802.html]. Randall is also known for his love of Venn diagrams, which feature heavily in xkcd. Randall especially loves Venn diagrams ABOUT Venn diagrams, like this one. While Harris frequently uses Venn diagrams with three intersecting circles as props, she also has [https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5125622/user-clip-circle-venn-diagram discussed them in the abstract, without reference to any physical diagram, even when discussing more than three intersecting categories.]\n\nPart of the humor arises from the contrast of putting on a level playing field three characteristics that range widely from the momentous to the quirky, as well as the implication that Randall and Harris are quite similar in all but one area: their fitness to serve as US President, per Randall's opinion. The diagram does not indicate anyone who Randall would include in the six other areas (categories) of the Venn diagram besides the two in which he listed himself and Harris. Randall seems to express support for a Democratic Presidential candidate every 8 years, including in a 2016 comic [[I'm With Her]] endorsing {{w|Hillary Clinton}} and in [https://blog.xkcd.com/2008/01/28/obama/ a 2008 blog post] endorsing {{w|Barack Obama}}.\n\nThe title text [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWR2uTfrh-k quotes Kamala Harris on her affection for Venn diagrams], and implies that the best way to target Randall with political ads is to mention how amazing Venn diagrams are.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A Venn diagram with three circles.]\n:[Upper left circle:] Eligible to be President\n:[Upper right circle:] Would be a good President\n:[Lower circle:] Unusually vocal about love of Venn diagrams\n:[Intersection of all three circles:] Kamala Harris\n:[Intersection of the upper left and lower circles:] Me\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Venn diagrams]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Elections]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring politicians]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Kamala Harris]]"
