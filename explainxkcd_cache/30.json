They were pioneers who got stranded and likely resorted to cannibalism.\n}}\n\nThis was the twenty-ninth comic [[LiveJournal|originally posted to LiveJournal]]. The previous one was [[27: Meat Cereals]], and the next one was [[34: Flowers]].\n\n==Explanation==\nThe {{w|Donner party}} was a group of pioneers who set out west along a new route that was supposed to be easier to travel, but ultimately proved slow and treacherous. They became trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains, and many died. It is believed that many of the pioneers, low on food, resorted to cannibalism, eating the bodies of party members who had already died. In this comic, three Donner party members arrive at Joe's restaurant, where they have ordered a table for four, as given by the fact that the {{w|Maître d'hôtel|maître d'}} knows they are the Donner party and calls for a party of four. The three decline the table since they are already full. This suggests that they just have eaten the fourth member (unknown to us) of their party after they placed the order for a table at the restaurant, but before they strolled over to it anyway. Of course, since they are not in a survival situation in this comic, cannibalism would be completely unnecessary. However, it may be possible that they are suffering from {{w|Wendigo|Wendigo Psychosis}}. Alternatively, the Donner Dinner Party may have resorted to cannibalism because it took so long to be seated at the restaurant. \n\nAs with many of the earlier comics, the title text explains the joke rather than adding to it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Three people stand outside a restaurant; Megan, a man with some hair (who looks like Hairy) and another shorter person, probably a woman. There is a sign above the door which says \"Joe's\" (presumably the name of the restaurant) and a menu next to it. Outside the door, there is a maître d' with a cap behind a lectern. There is a sign on the lectern which says \"Eat in\".]\n:maître d': Donner, party of four?\n:Man: Actually, never mind.\n:Megan: We're full.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 29]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]] <!-- proto-Hairy features noted, anyway -->\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Characters with hats]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
