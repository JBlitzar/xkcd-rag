For instance, when the dog bites, when the bee stings, when {{w|My Favorite Things (song)|I'm feeling sad}}, or when a program crashes (e.g. a {{w|Segmentation fault|segfault}}), the victim often reacts by swearing.\n\nFor [[Randall]], however, profanities are caused mostly by the video game {{w|Mario Kart}}, specifically {{w|blue shell}}s according to the comic's title. These blue shells, when fired, target the player currently in first place and stop them cold. In a close game near the end of the race, a player can go from first to an unrecoverable last in one hit. \n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash!!|Mario Kart: Double Dash}}. This includes a technique to avoid being hit by a blue shell, but it requires skillful timing to accomplish.  The term \"{{w|deep magic}}\" comes from computer programmer slang. Interestingly, with a boost mushroom in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8 (and the so-called \"Super-Horn\" in the latter), it is also possible (with accurate timing) to escape blue shells.\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Profanity Usage By Cause:\n:[A pie chart is shown.]\n:[Injury is about 2.5% of pie chart.]\n:[Irony is about 2.5% of pie chart.]\n:[Misc is about 2.5% of pie chart.]\n:[Segfaults is about 10% of pie chart.]\n:[Mario Kart is about 82.5% of pie chart.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Pie charts]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Mario Kart]]"
