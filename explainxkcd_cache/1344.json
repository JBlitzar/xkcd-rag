When two tiles of the same number touch they can be merged into one tile with a value of the two tiles combined. So when two 4-tiles touch and are merged they form one 8-tile. The player can move the tiles by pressing an arrow key (or swiping in a direction on the mobile version), which will move all the tiles in that direction. Every time the player makes such a move another tile will appear on a random cell. The goal of the game is to get a tile with the number 2048.\n\nIn the comic the room number can be seen as 4 tiles with the values 8, 2, 2 and 4. If these occur in the game the player can merge the two 2-tiles into one 4-tile. This will then cause two 4-tiles to lie next to each other, so these can be merged into one 8-tile. Finally, the two 8-tiles can be merged into one 16-tile.\n\n[[File:8224.gif]]\n\nThis can be done in the opposite direction as well.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|Tetris effect}}, which takes its name from the game {{w|Tetris}}. People who play Tetris for extended periods tend to imagine real-life objects (like skylines) as Tetris landscapes and pieces. [[Randall]], [http://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/wootdesigncontestentries/fackoph/chicago_skyline_%28Tetris_Redux%29-q71p5a-s.jpg as many others], apparently got hooked on Tetris so much when it came out that, for 20 years, he would look at city skylines and see Tetris-like patterns in it. Similarly, he has now been hooked onto 2048 and notices number patterns that would be desirable to obtain during the game.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A guy is walking and Cueball is following him.]\n:Guy: The talk is in room 8224.\n:Cueball: Ooh, nice.\n:Guy: What?\n:Cueball: ...Sorry. Nothing.\n\n:Great, now I'll spend the rest of my life noticing numbers that would make good 2048 combos.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Comics [[724: Hell]] and [[888: Heaven]] also refer to Tetris.\n*There is another game named [http://newbrict.github.io/Fe26/ <nowiki>Fe[26]</nowiki>] that simulates fusion in a star to create elements, as described in [[1123: The Universal Label]]. It is \"Created by Dimitar Dimitrov and Kevin O'Connor for ASTR-1960@RPI. Based on 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli. Based on 1024 by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.\"\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
