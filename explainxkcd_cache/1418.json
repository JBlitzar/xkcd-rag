Some of the humorous resulting news headlines are shown. This is probably a parody of the [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai?hl=en Cloud to Butt Chrome Extension] (since it says ''new'' favorite browser text replacement). There has been several [[:Category:Substitutions|comics using substitutions]] before and also at least one after this one.\n\n; Ukrainian town threatened by pro-Russian horses\n:The {{w|Russo-Ukrainian War}} had begun some seven months earlier, but until the {{w|Russian invasion of Ukraine|2022 invasion}}, Russia mainly used {{w|irregular military|irregular forces}} and {{w|Little green men (Russo-Ukrainian War)|soldiers without insignias on their uniforms}}. These were often euphemistically referred to as \"pro-Russian forces\" by the media (rather than \"Russian forces\"). Since this comic's publication, horses have in fact [https://www.military.com/feature/2025/10/08/ukrainian-drones-attack-russian-cavalry-troops-rare-21st-century-encounter.html been used in combat] by the Russian military in Ukraine.\n\n; Governor appoints task horse\n:A {{w|Task force}} is a unit or formation established to work on a single defined task or activity, which makes it quite comical to picture a horse instead of a unit.  A \"task horse\" would presumably be a horse performing tasks.\n\n; Iraqi Air Horse growing\n:The Air ''Force'' of Iraq may indeed be being up-armed, especially in light of the threat, at this time, of ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State forces across swaths of both Iraq and Syria. In mythology, Pegasus was a winged horse that could fly through the air, and might be considered an \"air horse\".  In real life, \"Air Horse One\" is an airplane equipped for transporting horses.\n\n; Quarks, which are bound together by the strong nuclear horse…\n:{{w|Quark|Quarks}} are elementary particles. They form bound states e.g. the {{w|proton}} (two up + one down-quark) mediated by the {{w|Strong interaction|strong force}}, similarly as atoms are bound states of {{w|Electron|electrons}} and charged {{w|Nucleon|nucleons}} held together by the {{w|Electromagnetism|electromagnetic horse}}, and these forces are also referenced in [[474: Turn-On]], [[1621: Fixion]] and in [[1731: Wrong]]. There is a real Nuclear horse in a different sense, which is a racehorse born in 2017 and named Nuclear.\n\n; Officer suspended from horse (title text)\n:Being suspended from a police force (i.e. usually being forced upon mandatory leave pending resolution of the issue at hand; paid, part-paid or unpaid) is a common practice where wrongdoing of sufficiently serious nature is suspected of the police officer, and it may occur in some countries if the police officer gets to old for the job. A person could literally be suspended from a horse if they fall off the horse but got stuck in the stirrups.  Unlike most of these \"horse\" terms, a police horse is a real thing.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Headlines above the main frame of the comic:]\n:New favorite browser text replacement:\n:'''Force → Horse'''\n\n:[In the comic frame Cueball is sitting in front of his PC reading the following headlines that are written above him in separate frames:]\n:Ukranian towns threatened by pro-Russian horses\n:Governor appoints task horse\n:Iraqi air horse growing\n:Quarks, which are bound together by the strong nuclear horse...\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the comic, Randall spelled \"Ukra'''i'''nian\" incorrectly, forgetting the first 'i'.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Substitutions]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
