It's very much a groupthink, \"mob\" mentality, bringing to mind the credo, \"If you're not with us, you're against us.\"\n\nHardly anyone goes to a protest because they're happy about the way things are, and thus, someone holding up signs saying how happy he is would, to say the least, be very out of place at a protest,{{citation needed}} {{tvtropes|WavingSignsAround|although it's more common than expected}}.\n\nThe title text shows another sign [[Cueball]] is carrying (although since it compliments the protesters, he may not get in as much trouble for it). It might be a reference to certain protest topic groups that are known for having some members that do not show up because of the protest topic, but show up because of the girls that will be there. (An example of a protest topic is {{w|animal rights}}.)\n\nThe title of the comic refers to the oft-seen protest placard \"The end is now,\" signifying that person's belief that we live in the end times, and it's time to start getting right with (insert religious figure of your choice here).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball with two picket signs. Ponytail with a picket sign stands partially out of the frame, staring at Cueball.]\n:I get in trouble for showing up contented at protests.\n:Sign 1: Things are pretty okay!\n:Sign 2: Anyone for Scrabble later?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
