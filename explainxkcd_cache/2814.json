Their name ultimately derives from the ancient Greek hero ''Perseus'' (for ''his'' pronunciation, check {{w|Perseus}}). There are various ways of pronouncing ''Perseids'', and [[Randall]] gives the obvious ones before the comic spirals into virtual nonsense, or possibly parodies of {{wiktionary|va-jay-jay|common euphemistic replacement words}}. This is written from an American English perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that the last consonant is often pronounced as a \"z\" sound rather than \"s\" (the technical term is \"voiced\"), which is not reflected in these spellings.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Section\n! scope=\"col\"| Term\n! scope=\"col\"| Explanation\n\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Generally accepted\n| PER-see-ids\n| Standard 3-syllable English pronunciation.\n|-\n| PURSE-yids\n| Standard 2.5 syllable pronunciation, nearly indistinguishable from the previous.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Also heard sometimes\n| Per-SEE-ids\n| The emPHAsis on the seCOND sylLAble is diFFERent than norMAL.\n|-\n| Per-SAY-ids\n| Accepted British pronunciation of Perseids with \"classical\" pronunciation of the \"ei\" digraph.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Generally frowned on\n| Per-SIDES\n| Two syllables with a Germanic pronunciation of the \"ei\" digraph.\n|-\n| Per-ZAY-uds\n| Voiced \"S\" phoneme. Could be acceptable in New Zealand.\n|-\n| PER-suds\n| Two syllables, ignoring the digraph altogether and making it schwa.\n|-\n!rowspan=\"9\"| Definitely wrong\n| Perky-ids\n| Backformed from the C=S equivalence but from the wrong kide.\n|-\n| Pewpewpews\n| An onomatopoeia for [[2817: Electron Holes|electron hole guns]] and fictional laser guns.\n|-\n| Per-say-says\n| This is a tradition of rhyming lazy/cute slang, like referring to the vagina as {{wiktionary|va-jay-jay}}.\n|-\n| Percies\n| \"Percies\" is plural of Percy, the short form of Perseus, and could easily be an abbreviated/informal form of \"Perseids\", especially when spoken.\n|-\n| Purps\n| \"Purps\" is close to \"Perps\", a short slang form of Perpetrator (generally the person responsible for a crime). Conceivably an evolution of pronunciation from re-extending the even more abbreviated \"Pers\" with a new plosive ending re-added.\n|-\n| Percies Purps\n| Together, this would be a name of a criminal gang, led by Perseus or Perseid.\n|- <!-- Seems like enough people want to keep the incorrect 4-term explanation, well at least also keep the correct 2-terms explanation as well -->\n| Pepsids\n| \"Pepsids\" could refer to {{w|Famotidine|Pepcid}} (an antacid), or it could also be referencing the {{w|Pepsi}} brand, through insertion of a single plosive 'p' in the loosely pronounced original word.\n|-\n| Peeps\n| \"Peeps\", derived vocally similarly to \"purps\", are possibly shorebirds that are not always easy to identify (for example the {{w|Least Sandpiper}}), also known as \"{{w|stints}}\". Or, continuing the bird theme, could directly reference {{w|Peeps|a spongy candy}} which is shaped and decorated like baby chickens. It is also a common slang term for \"people\"; particularly an in-group that the speaker identifies with, as in \"my peeps\".\n|-\n| Pepsids Peeps\n| Together, these would be people who bond over their reliance on Pepcid (and their interest in the Perseids, hence spelling it with an S)\n|}\n\nThe title text mentions how \"meteor\" sounds like \"meatier,\" {{w|Homophone|although the meanings are completely different}}. It suggests telling people about the {{w|Kentucky meat shower}}, an anomalous weather event in 1876, as a [[2467: Wikipedia Caltrops|way to distract]] them. It also has the word \"can\" twice.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:How to pronounce the name of the Perseids meteor shower\n\n:[A table is divided into two columns and four rows.]\n\n:[Row 1:]\n:Generally accepted\n\n::PER-see-ids\n::PURSE-yids\n\n:[Row 2:]\n:Also heard sometimes\n\n::Per-SEE-ids\n::Per-SAY-ids\n\n:[Row 3:]\n:Generally frowned on\n\n::Per-SIDES\n::Per-ZAY-uds\n::PER-suds\n\n:[Row 4:]\n:''Definitely'' wrong\n\n::Perky-ids\n::Pewpewpews\n::Per-say-says\n::Percies Purps\n::Pepsids Peeps\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]"
