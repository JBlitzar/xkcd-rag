The opposite approach, setting a work in a speculative future, has been less common prior to modern times. The oldest example Randall presents is from 1733, but it didn't really become a trend until well into the 19th century, and didn't become really common until the 20th century.\n\nFor works set in the future, particularly in the near future, there's a real possibility that audiences will still read or watch it past the date in which is was set, allowing them to compare the real world of this era to the one the author projected. This doesn't make the work less valuable, necessarily, but it does make the limits of such speculation painfully obvious, and tends to make the [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust future presented there look dated and quaint]. Randall labels these futuristic works as \"obsolete\".\n\nFor works set in the past, there's an opposite and somewhat more subtle effect.  Once the work itself is old enough, audiences tend to forget that they were intended as historical fiction in the first place. If an old work is set in the past, it's often assumed that they were set in their own time, not in the still more distant past. That impacts how we experience the work, because we tend to assume that it's a faithful representation of its own time, not a later interpretation that was intended to be old (and possibly nostalgic) even in its own time.\n\nOn top of this, in a similar situation to the failed attempt at {{w|futurology}}, for future-facing works of fiction, even a conscientiously faithful 'historic' film can age badly. Later understanding of previously hazy historical situations can be developed between the time of the fictional work being authored and your experience of it.\n\nTo demonstrate those impacts, this chart sorts various works by the year they were created, graphed against how far in the past or future they were originally set.  Lines on the chart are added to separate when each work ceases to work as either a prediction or as a [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece period piece]. For future works, the cut-off is obvious: if it was set in a year prior to the current year, we know that the predictions are obsolete (and can easily determine how accurate or inaccurate that future is).  Hence, at the time the chart was written (in 2015), works like ''1984'' and ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are obsolete, while works like ''Star Trek'', which take place in a more distant future, are still theoretically possible. (''Back to the Future Part II'' is deliberately right on the line, as it was set in 2015).  \n\nFor the past works, Randall sets the cut-off as when the work itself is older than the events in question were when it was first written/made.  Hence, modern audiences are unlikely to realize that the Epic of Gilgamesh was intended to sound ancient, even when it was new, or that novels like ''Les Miserables'' were intended as historical fiction, or even that films like ''Chinatown'' or shows like ''Happy Days'' were intended as period pieces when they were made.  To modern audiences, we just see an old work set in an old time, and tend to assume that the two periods were the same.\n\nThe setup of the chart points to the reality that, in process of time, more and more works will cross those lines. Future audiences will likely assume that films like ''Apollo 13'' and ''Schindler's List'' were made around the time of the events in question. And modern science fiction works, if they're still remembered in the future, will become just as obsolete as past works.  And Randall even indicates \"this chart\" on the chart, apparently acknowledging that it will become dated as time goes by. \n\nThe title text jokes that ''2001'' cuts from prehistoria to the future before ''The Flintstones'' theme can become recognizable. This references the fact that, despite being primarily set in what was then the future, the film opens in the ancient past, thus appearing in both parts of the graph, with one part being very close to ''The Flintstones''. This plays on the fact that one of these was a very serious work and the other a playful animated show that was intended as family comedy. Also, the prehistoric part ends with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZzVNLCeYKI an hominid screaming], in a way that could transition into [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq7noaMwLfg the horns of ''The Flintstones'' opening].\n\n===How to read the graph===\n* X-axis: Date of publication.\n* Y-axis, \"Years in the future\": Number of years the story's events take place, after the story's publication.\n* Y-axis, \"Years in the past\": Number of years the story's events take place, before the story's publication.\n: For example, \"Water Margin\" was published in the 14th century (x ~= 1300) and relates events from the 12th century, about 200 years before its publication (y ~= 200 in the past).\n: Another example: The film ''{{w|The Bridge on the River Kwai}}'' was released in 1957 and it was set around 14 years before (~1942-43).\n* Grey area in the \"Years in the future\" part: Stories set in the future (relative to their publication date), for which the date of the events in the story is already in the past (relative to the publication date of the comic). The white and gray areas in this part of the graph are defined as \"still possible\" and \"obsolete\", respectively. The gray area (obsolete) will expand over time, assuming more works aren't added in the future: predictions from science fiction or futuristic work that are not confirmed by reality are doomed to be obsolete.\n* Grey area in the \"Years in the past\" part: Stories set in the past (relative to their publication date) but published closer to their setting than to today. The warning \"Modern audiences may not recognize which part were supposed to sound old\" is a recurrent theme in the author's work, being already formulated in [[771: Period Speech|Period Speech]] comic. The white area seems to be the region where modern readers will be able to distinguish the past setting of a work from the age of the work itself. This gray area will grow over time (again assuming new works set in the past are not added) with more and more works being indistinguishable as works set in the past.\n\nTaking the \"years in the past\" on the y-axis to be read as negatives like in most graphs one can write\n* Dates on the lower line satisfy the equation y = x-2015. Corresponding works were published in the year x = 2015+y and are set in the year x+y = 2015+2y.\n* Dates on the upper line satisfy the equation y = 2015-x. Corresponding works were published in the year x = 2015-y and are set in the year x+y = 2015.\nThus it's clear that the definitions of the lines are consistent with each other as they follow similar but inverted functions.\nThe graph uses variable {{w|logarithmic scale}}s, adjusting the scale in various regions to the temporal density of works being plotted. If the scale were linear, the graph would in fact represent a (bidimensional) {{w|Minkowski diagram}}, which depicts the moving cones of past and future in spacetime as one's present advances in time.\n\n=== Works listed ===\nDifferences listed in <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">bright red</span> are \"former period pieces.\" Differences listed in <span style=\"color:#8B0000;\">dark red</span> are other works set in the past.

This may be to allow room for other nearby labels.\n*The {{w|Gospels}} are horizontally positioned at about the year 250 CE, when they should be positioned slightly further to the left, near the 100 CE line. (While there is debate on their date of authorship, the range of \"years in the past\" indicated on the graph would require authorship between roughly 50 and 100 CE.)\n*''{{w|Lest Darkness Fall}}'' takes place about 1400 years in the past, in the year 535. Its placement on the graph indicates it takes place about ''535'' years in the past, in the year ''1400''.\n\n===Spelling===\n*Author Washington Irving titled his work ''{{w|Rip Van Winkle}}'', not ''Rip van Winkel'' as [[Randall]] spells it. That said, ''van {{w|nl:Winkel|Winkel}}'' may be a more historically authentic spelling.\n*''{{w|Les Misérables}}'' has been misspelled ''Les Miserábles'' (note that French doesn't use the character \"á\").\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript}}\n:'''Date of publication'''\n:[A logarithmic scale running horizontally, from 3000 BCE to past 2015 CE.]\n:'''Years in the future'''\n:[A logarithmic scale running vertically, from 1 billion down to 0.]\n:'''Stories set in the future''' (science fiction, prediction)\n::Stories set in 2015\n::[A line divides this region into two.
