Cueball is impatient for the vaccine to be released to the public, wanting the pandemic to end as soon as possible. Because of that, he is treating the state vaccine website like a package tracker, even though it will probably be several months before he is vaccinated. \n\nOf course, the state vaccine website does not act like a package tracker, and updates will be few and far between. The comedy in this comes from Cueball expecting it to update regularly, even though the vaccine is not going to come anytime soon for most people, especially for those in Cueball's presumed priority level. Checking once a day for general 'movement' probably would ''more than'' suffice to get a head's up on when a possible invitation or opportunity to book would present itself.\n\nThe title text refers to Pfizer's vaccine plant in the city of {{w|Kalamazoo, Michigan}}, and is also a reference to [[281: Online Package Tracking]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan walks towards Cueball.
