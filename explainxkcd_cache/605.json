By connecting two points without any context, we can come up with incredibly funny and absurd results. Here, connecting a bride's number of spouses yesterday (zero) and today—her wedding day—(one) can result in a linear extrapolation to hundreds of spouses a year. Cueball presents the accumulation of husbands as though it were a phenomenon beyond the bride's ability to control. Using similar points for pregnancy (yesterday: no babies, today: one), we can get 200+ children inside a single person by the seventh month of pregnancy.\n\nThis is another comic in the infrequent [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby]] series. Extrapolation and interpolation, often absurd, are also [[:Category:Extrapolation|recurrent topics]] on xkcd.\n\n==Transcript==\n:My Hobby: Extrapolating\n\n:[There is a graph. Time runs along the horizontal axis; Number of Husbands on the vertical graph. Yesterday and today are labeled in time, 0 and 1 in number of husbands. Points are plotted with 0 at yesterday, 1 at today. A straight line is fitted through them.]\n:[Cueball is holding a pointer to the graph, and looking at Megan wearing a bridal train and veil.]\n:Cueball: As you can see, by late next month you'll have over four dozen husbands.\n:Cueball: Better get a bulk rate on wedding cake.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with babies]]\n[[Category:Line graphs]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Wedding]]\n[[Category:Extrapolation]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
