    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1750\n| date      = October 24, 2016\n| title     = Life Goals\n| image     = life_goals.png\n| titletext = I got to check off 'Make something called xkcd' early.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nAll visible goals except the last one on this to-do list feature one or more strange words containing an excess of the last three letters of the alphabet (X, Y and Z), often using several of them in the same words, even several of the same rare letter in a row. (See [[#Table of life goals|Table of life goals]] below). \n\nAll of these words can be looked up in the English version of Wikipedia, but only a few are {{w|common noun}}s, three of them weird animal names, the rest being {{w|proper nouns}}, i.e. persons names (fictional or artist) or obscure names for places or video games. The first goal is the one with fewest of these letters, only using two x's, and only the first word is strange, {{w|Skrillex}} being the artist's name of a musician. All later entries have at least three of these letters, which are most often used in very strange, often difficult-to-pronounce, words.\n\nThe punchline, in the final and ninth goal, expresses that the writer of this list often uses these unexpected and bizarre words in {{w|Scrabble}} games, which exasperates his opponents to such a great extent that he has yet to finish a game without getting punched. All of these words would theoretically earn a player many points in Scrabble, but outside of casual play it is not allowed to use proper nouns (see [[#Scrabble points|Scrabble points]] below).\n\nIn the title text, a reference is made to the fact that none of these goals have been checked off yet. It also turns out that it is indeed [[Randall|Randall's]] list, since the writer of the list did (at least) manage to check off the goal ''Make something called xkcd'' early. Sadly there are neither y's nor z's nor even more than one x in that four letter combo.\n\nThis comic was published the week after the ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article ''{{what if|152|Flood Death Valley}}'', which referred directly to the city {{w|Zzyzx}} in one of the pictures. It's the second comic in that week after the what if? post that references it more or less directly, the previous one being [[1748: Future Archaeology]]. It seems likely that Randall created this comic after doing research for this what if? post, and came across the city Zzyzx as the shortest way to dig a channel to flood Death Valley.\n\n===Table of life goals===\n*The number of letters X, Y and Z is in the entire sentence.\n*The total is the total number of these three letters in the entire sentence.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n! Goal\n! Explanation\n! #X\n! #Y\n! #Z\n! Total\n|-\n| Meet Skrillex in Phoenix || Randall's goal is to meet the musician using the artist name {{w|Skrillex}} in the city of {{w|Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix}}. Not that Skrillex has any specific connection to that city.{{Citation needed}} || 2|| 0|| 0|| 2\n|-\n| Study zymurgy  || {{w|Zymurgy}} (or zymology) is an applied science which studies the biochemical process of {{w|fermentation}}.|| 0|| 3|| 1|| 4\n|-\n| Get a pet axolotl named Hexxus  || Randall's goal is to obtain a type of pet Mexican neotenic salamander (an {{w|axolotl}}) and name it after the malevolent Hexxus from the animated film {{w|FernGully: The Last Rainforest}}. (Hexxus has been mentioned on xkcd after this, namely on [[1767: US State Names]] and [[1918: NEXUS]].) The axolotl is a critically endangered species in nature, but they are relatively popular in captivity, with well established captive breeding populations. || 3|| 0|| 0|| 3\n|-\n| Observe a syzygy from Zzyzx, California  || Randall's goal is to observe an astronomical event in which three celestial bodies form a straight line (known as a {{w|Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy}}), from the Californian city of {{w|Zzyzx, California|Zzyzx}}. That city had recently been mentioned in the last ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article: ''{{what if|152|Flood Death Valley}}'', released less than a week before this comic. || 1|| 4|| 4|| 9\n|-\n| Port the games Zzyzzyxx and Xexyz to Xbox  || Randall's goal is to {{w|porting|port}} (i.e. adapting software from one platform so it can be used on another platform) two old video games so they can be used on the modern video game platform {{w|Xbox}}. The first game is {{w|Zzyzzyxx}}, a 1982 {{w|arcade video game}} about navigating a labyrinth, and the second is {{w|Xexyz}}, a 1988 game for the {{w|Nintendo Entertainment System}} with platform and shoot-em-up game-play. [http://xbmcxbox.blogspot.com/2013/03/complete-list-of-emulators-for-original.html Multiple emulators already exist] that can run both of these titles, although an actual native port would be a lot more difficult. || 6|| 3|| 5|| 14\n|-\n| Publish a Zzzax/Mister Mxyzptlk crossover  || A {{w|Crossover (fiction)|crossover}} means that two different stories (often comics) are mixed together, mixing either characters from the two, or the world of one and the characters of another story. In this case Randall's goal is to make a cross over of {{w|Zzzax}}, a {{w|Marvel comic}} book villain, with that of {{w|Mister Mxyzptlk}}, a {{w|DC Comics}} villain. Since Zzzax and Mxyzptlk come from different companies, a crossover story involving them both might run into license problems if published commercially, though the two companies have come together on {{w|Intercompany crossovers in comics|several occasions}} for similar projects. Alternatively, Randall could choose to do a crossover with {{w|Zsasz}} instead, both being DC villains would make it easier to make and publish.  || 2|| 1|| 4|| 7\n|-\n| Bike from Xhafzotaj, Albania to Qazaxbəyli, Azerbaijan  || Randall's goal is to bike from {{w|Xhafzotaj}}, a village in {{w|Albania}} in eastern {{w|Europe}}, to {{w|Qazaxbəyli}}, a village in {{w|Azerbaijan}} in the {{w|Caucasus}}. The distance between [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Xhafzotaj,+Albanien/@41.3420999,19.538176,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x134fd7eb6257dec7:0xc0c17ea9f1d4ef05!8m2!3d41.3442157!4d19.547883 Xhafzotaj] and [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gazakhbayly,+Aserbaidschan/@41.1604329,45.3040337,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4041307bb83f5793:0x30f6c3728844806e!8m2!3d41.1606486!4d45.3147936 Qazaxbəyli] is about 2800 km (1700 miles). Doing this trip by bike would be challenging, but possible. || 2|| 1|| 3|| 7\n|-\n| Paint an Archaeopteryx fighting a Muzquizopteryx  || Randall's goal is to make a painting of two flying {{w|Ornithodiran}}s fighting. Unfortunately, {{w|Archaeopteryx}}, a famous small feathered dinosaur, and {{w|Muzquizopteryx}}, a {{w|pterosaur}} (the famous flying \"dinosaurs\"), lived in different time periods, so such a fight (most likely) could not have ever taken place; therefore, a painted picture of it would require a fair amount of {{w|artistic license}}. The feathered dinosaur was only about half a meter long, but with clear feathers. It is a clear candidate for a {{w|transitional fossil}} between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. It lived in the {{w|late Jurassic}} epoch around 150 million years ago. The pterosaur had a wingspan of about 2 m, was one of the first (and smallest) of this type of pterosaur, and lived in the {{w|Coniacian}} age about 86-90 million years ago. This means the two ornithodirans live as far apart in time as we live apart from the last of the dinosaurs. Since Muzquizopteryx was larger, it seems likely that it would have won such a fight. Randall has previously made several comments on the feathers of dinosaurs, as recently as the comic released a week before this one [[1747: Spider Paleontology]]; see more there. (This scene [https://www.deviantart.com/seleuf/art/Archaeopteryx-VS-Muzquizopteryx-659380937 has been drawn] after the comic was published.) || 2|| 2|| 2|| 6\n|-\n| Finish a game of Scrabble without getting punched  || Randall's final goal is to avoid getting punched during a {{w|Scrabble}} game. As he uses these unexpected and bizarre words mentioned in his other goals when playing Scrabble games, he exasperates his opponents to such a great extent that he has yet to finish a game without getting punched. This sentence is the only one with zero of the three letters. || 0|| 0|| 0|| 0\n|-\n| Make something called xkcd  || '''Title text''':  Here it is made clear that this is Randall's list, as this is his only xyz goal that he has succeeded, and quite early, as he has already [[1581: Birthday|celebrated its 10 years anniversary]].  || 1|| 0|| 0|| 1\n|}\n\n===Scrabble points===\nAll of these strange words would theoretically earn a player the prize of many points in Scrabble (Go to the [[#Table of words|table of words]] below). However, most of them would not be found in {{w|SOWPODS}} (the combined list of all words valid in either British or North American Scrabble tournaments).  Also, many include too many X's, Y's or Z's (there's 1 X, 2 Y's, 1 Z in a standard set), meaning at least one would have to be substituted for a blank (which is not worth any points). Some words would also be very difficult to play in reality, since there are only 7 letters in a Scrabble hand, so they could only be played in extremely rare circumstances (there are only a couple of ways to play MUZQUIZOPTERYX: for instance, from MU and OPTER; or MU, QUIZ and ER; or an astonishingly unlikely set of crossing letters). Many are long enough that, in theory, they could net the player the additional 50 point bonus for using all seven letters in a hand if played right.\n\n====Table of words====\n*Explanation of the columns:\n**Word: With xyz\n**Definition: Of the word\n**Notes: Part of speech (noun or proper noun) and origin of the word\n**In SOWPODS?: Is the word a valid Scrabble word.\n**Enough tiles (...): Are there enough tiles in the standards English version of Scrabble to write the word?\n**Score: What would the maximum possible score in Scrabble be for this word.
