Jeffy is a character in ''Family Circus'', and dotted lines representing his wanderings are a frequent theme of ''Family Circus'' comics. {{w|Obsessive-compulsive disorder}} (OCD) is a mental illness that compels the sufferer to perform repetitive actions. Common symptoms include, but are not restricted to, excessive hand washing and repeated opening and closing of a door.\n\nThe comic depicts the character Jeffy as having Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and traces his movements over a period of time. The dotted line that depicts his movements returns frequently to the kitchen sink, presumably either to repeatedly wash his hands or to make sure that the faucet was turned off.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] attributes this idea to the unknown friend [[David]]. He did the same in [[42: Geico]] and [[51: Malaria]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Picture shows a pathway winding through trees to a sink inside a house, out to some swings and back to the sink, out to a ball and back to the sink, then on into the house.
