But why would any metal want to grow hair??\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic is part of the [[:Category:Unsolved Problems|Unsolved Problems series]] and follows [[2943: Unsolved Chemistry Problems]] and [[2529: Unsolved Math Problems]]. {{w|Quantum gravity}} is the problem of determining how {{w|gravity}} interacts with the physics of {{w|quantum mechanics}}. There are {{w|General relativity#Relationship with quantum theory|contradictions}} between the two theories as currently understood. Gravity is described by the theory of {{w|general relativity}} and is well-characterized at large scales, while quantum mechanics is also well-understood and well-characterized but is easiest to observe at very small scales. This scale discrepancy makes it hard to conduct an experiment that includes both phenomena, leading to a wide range of unifying theories that are difficult to experimentally confirm or refute. In this comic, the question is specifically what part time plays in quantum gravity, but this is left vague and open-ended by considering several different options that may or may not be mutually contradictory.\n\nThe second issue, the {{w|Soviet–American Gallium Experiment#Gallium anomaly|gallium anomaly}}, is an example of a precise experiment to understand a specific phenomenon, namely a deficit of germanium (<sup>71</sup>Ge) when gallium (<sup>71</sup>Ga) is bombarded with neutrinos (''ν''<sub>e</sub>). The difference between the expectation and reality is small but statistically significant, and indicates our models of physics are inaccurate. One possible explanation is the creation of {{w|sterile neutrino|sterile neutrinos}}, a theoretical type of neutrino outside of the standard model that would only interact with other matter gravitationally, making them essentially impossible to detect directly and one of the proposed explanations for the nature of dark matter.\n\n[[Image:Zinc whiskers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Millimeter-long zinc whiskers on zinc-coated steel]]\nThe third problem concerns {{w|Whisker (metallurgy)|zinc whiskers}} — a phenomenon that at first sounds extremely strange, and the mechanism for which is {{w|List of unsolved problems in physics#Condensed matter physics|not fully understood}}, in which a piece of metal (in this case zinc) can 'grow' hair-like filaments on its surface. Hair is usually thought of as an organic structure, and spontaneous change in a block of metal is not a problem most people would expect (leading to an off-panel character to ask whether it is a joke). For an inorganic object to grow hair seems both magical and grotesque, so [[Randall]] considers this phenomenon [[:Category:Comics with cursed items|cursed]]. Metal  whiskers can cause problems in a lot of electronics, where metal hairs create unwanted electrical connections or act as antennae. In particular, they can degrade performance of rechargeable batteries. Since electronic devices are ubiquitous, the prevention of metal whiskers is a challenge that affects us widely, while it is hard to see how the other two issues affect most people. The problems caused by metal whisker growth also support the \"cursed\" descriptor. Lead has been widely used as an additive to solder for whisker prevention, but lead is toxic and has in fact been {{w|Solder#Lead-free solder|banned in the E.U.}} for most electronics.\n\nThe title text mentions {{w|tin pest}} — a transformation which causes deterioration of formed tin objects into a powder in a chilly environment. Randall considers this an understandable rebellion of the tin against being forced into shapes that we want it to take, whereas he cannot understand the motivation of zinc to grow hair. In reality, metallic elements do not have [https://groups.google.com/g/sci.physics/c/C2CfIKWFduU/ motivations and intentions]. The actual cause of tin pest is that solid tin has two forms {{w|Allotropy|(allotropes)}} with different crystal structures. β-tin is white, metallic, and malleable, and the more stable at temperatures above 13.2°C; α-tin is grey, non-metallic, and brittle, and is stable at temperatures below 13.2°C. When an object is made from tin, it's generally done at higher temperatures, where it's easily worked, resulting in the β crystal structure. If such an object is then left at lower temperatures, it eventually spontaneously changes to the α crystal structure, but the transition causes it to disintegrate. Impurities in the tin can lower the transition temperature, or prevent the disintegration from occurring at all. Tin pest was famously responsible for the destruction of the tin pipes of pipe organs in churches, when those churches were allowed to get below the transition temperature at times they weren't being heated.\n\nA similar spontaneous reorganization in crystal structure is one possible factor in the growth of metal whiskers. Preferred crystal shapes can be strongly influenced by subtle factors of temperature and impurities, and atoms and molecules can slowly rearrange even in solids. If a solid mass is in the form of extremely tiny crystals that precipitated quickly, atoms and molecules can depart from the surfaces (especially the edges and corners) of the smallest crystals and redeposit on larger crystals. Impurities that were trapped by the original rapid precipitation tend to be released in the process, caught between the growing purer crystals.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n: The Three Types of Unsolved Physics Problem\n\n: [Each physics problem is in a separate panel]\n\n: Vague\n: [A Feynman diagram of two particles interacting via the electromagnetic force is to the right of Cueball.
