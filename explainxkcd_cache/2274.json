It was followed by [[3072: Stargazing 4]] five years later.\n\nAs in the first two comics, [[Megan]] is hosting a stargazing event, in which she mixes accurate astronomical information with trivialities, as well as utterly bizarre statements. (See this [[1644: Stargazing#Relevant TV-shows|section]] from the original Stargazing comic about the host and also the [[1644: Stargazing#Trivia|trivia]], from the original comic, regarding the gender of the host).\n\n{{w|Vega}} is a star in the constellation of {{w|Lyra}}. It does indeed have {{w|Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude}} 0.03 and is the brightest star mentioned in this comic. Vega is only the {{w|List of brightest stars|5th brightest star}} (outside of the Sun), as {{w|Sirius}} is the brightest visible star.  The phrase <q>It's the brightest star I'm currently talking about</q> is an example of the technically correct but not at all useful information that is typical of the Stargazing series. The phrase is true no matter what, because any star one talks about is the brightest star one is talking about, as any brighter star becomes the one talked about when mentioned.{{Citation needed}} \n\n{{w|Polaris}} is indeed the star over the North Pole, and is commonly called the North Star or the Pole Star. It is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, but there are about fifty other stars that are as bright as it is (magnitude 2), so it's not really remarkable apart from being the pole star, as Megan says. Despite the fact that being the pole star is \"all it has going for it,\" it is nevertheless very important because it is used for navigation, as it appears fixed in the night sky. It hasn't always been and won't always be the pole star, however, as Earth's axis precesses in a 26,000 year cycle.\n\n{{w|Comets}} are comparatively small clumps of rock and ice, seen mostly by the long, lit 'trail' of particles the heat of the sun causes to be ejected, and the solar wind then spreads outward in thin glowing lines that ''can'' be larger and more visible even than the constellations they are seen in front of - at least during the brief phase of their closest approach to the sun.  Comets generally have highly elliptical orbits around the Sun and so they are only seen for a brief period of time \"every few decades\" during their closest aproach. Yelling at comets is believed to be an ineffective way to make them go away.{{Citation needed}} Megan may dislike comets because of their history in superstition of being seen as a sign of doom. This provides humor because typically this superstitious fear was caused by a lack of understanding, and it would be expected that a stargazing host would be informed on and therefore unafraid of comets.  No actual astronomers are bothered by comets,{{Citation needed}} but some are upset about [https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/starlink-satellites-astronomy/ satellite megaconstellations] such as {{w|SpaceX Starlink|SpaceX's Starlink}}.  In that case, astronomers are not yelling at the satellites, but at the companies that launch them.\n\n{{w|Light pollution}} is indeed a problem with stargazing. Light pollution is the presence of artificial light in the night sky, which makes it very difficult to see stars. Stargazing in remote locations is remarkably different than in populated cities. Light pollution was previously discussed in [[2121: Light Pollution]].  Light pollution does not actually make the \"sky go away\", but it does affect how humans can see stars or other astronomical features in the sky.\n\nMegan advocates an active approach to resolving light pollutionâ€”rather than lobbying for reductions in artificial lighting, as the {{w|dark-sky movement}} does, she intends to lead her audience in destroying artificial lights.  Older lightbulbs are usually glass bulbs filled with inert gas (for incandescent bulbs) or high-pressure gases (for e.g. {{w|sodium-vapor lamp}}s) and so are easy to destroy with any blunt impact, thus accounting for Megan's mention of \"throwing rocks at them\". Modern LED lights, however, are much more robust, which is why she is handing out crossbows to achieve greater projectile energy.  An \"[http://sonic.net/~rknop/php/astronomy/classes/a103/sum2006/info/angdist.shtml#xbow astronomy crossbow]\" is a tool used to measure the angular distance between stars. They cannot shoot real {{w|crossbow bolt}}s, but any type of crossbow or other weapon could be used to destroy lights and \"preserve\" the sky.  (Speaking of astronomy tools that have weapon-related names, there is a type of telescope called a \"{{w|Sun Gun Telescope|Sun Gun}}\", but it is only meant to be used during the day to enable groups of people to view the Sun safely.  It is probably best that Megan's show is taking place at night, or else she might cause even more trouble.)\n\nIn the title text Megan mentions that by destroying enough of the lights in the region will make it possible to see more comets. By reducing the light pollution it will in general be possible to see more of any kind of astronomical objects, not just comets. Megan has made clear she dislikes comets, and is thus not interested in seeing any of them. To see more of any of the other astronomical objects out there, she is willing to take the risk of seeing more comets, by lowering the light pollution.\n\nThis comic became the last comic not to be related to [[:Category:COVID-19|COVID-19]] for more than a month!\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In a dark panel, Megan as a TV host stands in front of a group of people: Hairbun, Ponytail and Cueball. The panel is inverse-colored, i.e. white text and drawings on black]\n:Host: Welcome back to Stargazing.\n:Host: There are no new stars since last time, but you came back for some reason.\n\n:[Zoomed out on the same scene, the host is now with Hairbun, Ponytail, Cueball, a Megan-like woman, and White Hat. The host is pointing upwards with her left hand.]\n:Host: That star is Vega. At magnitude 0.03, it's the brightest star I'm currently talking about.\n:Host: That one is Polaris. It's over the North Pole, which is all it has going for it.\n\n:[A frame-less white panel, zoomed in on the host, who is now pointing upwards with her right hand.]\n:Host: That's a comet. Some of them come back every few decades, no matter how much I yell at them.\n:Host: But stargazing isn't all fun yelling. We face a problem even worse than comets: light pollution.\n\n:[Back to a dark panel, the host now has a big bag of crossbows. The bag has a logo of a crossbow with stars around it. She has taken out one of them and is holding it in her right hand.]\n:Host: The sky is going away because people keep shining lights at it. The new LEDs are even worse - they're too blue, and you can't turn them off by throwing rocks at them like with the old ones.\n:Host: Luckily, I brought these astronomy crossbows.\n:Host: Take one, then let's fan out and look for lamps.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Stargazing]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Stargazing]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Crossbows]]"
