[https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001 One of Isaac Newton's biographers] reported that his inquiries into the nature of gravity were \"occasion'd by the fall of an apple\" as he sat under a tree. Over time, this evolved into the story that a falling apple struck Newton on the head. Some versions of the story imagine him gazing at the moon when the apple hits him, and having the revelation that the force pulling the apple toward the earth was the same force that kept the moon in orbit.\n\nIn this strip, Cueball (or {{W|Isaac Newton}}) is similarly struck by a falling apple, while gazing at the moon. But rather than an insight about gravity, he makes a different connection, that of starting an apple orchard on the Moon. This would, of course, require some form of massive terraforming project (or at least the construction of a large, pressurized dome), since the airless environment of the moon wouldn't allow any plants to survive. It's not entirely ridiculous that the contrast between the lifeless moon and the lush landscape of an apple orchard would inspire someone to seek to plant life on the moon. \n\nThe title text claims that Newton thought that the Moon itself was in fact a tasty apple, but the {{w|Apollo program}} proved it was a {{w|Red Delicious}} apple. This is a jab at Randall's least favorite type of apple, as has been [[388|previously]] [[1766|noted]]. That apple variety became the most popular variety in the USA after its introduction but, to satisfy market demand, growers began selecting for storage and cosmetic appeal over flavor and palatability. Popularity has declined significantly in recent decades. \"Desolate and bland\" echoes Apollo astronaut {{w|Buzz Aldrin}} describing the moonscape as \"magnificent desolation\".\n\nThe tale of Newton and the apple was previously mentioned in [[1584: Moments of Inspiration]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits under a tree. An apple falls from the tree and hits him on the head, then arcs towards the ground.]\n:''Bonk''\n\n:[The view zooms out, showing the moon, which Cueball looks up at. The apple lies at Cueballâ€™s feet.]\n\n:[Closeup on Cueball.]\n:Cueball: ...\n\n:Cueball: ''We should grow apples on the moon.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
