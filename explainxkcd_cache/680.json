Imagine: snowed in, candles, massage oil, your mom sporting nothing but her early 80's haircut and a smile... aren't you glad you read the title-text?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nOn Christmas Day, most kids whose families celebrate the holiday get Christmas presents. And kids who were actually born on the 25th may feel a little put off because they don't get a special day all to themselves like their siblings and friends do. A lot of families alleviate this by celebrating the child's birthday on a day other than the 25th, so the kid will still get their own party. Unfortunately, the child may not get double presents, but may instead end up getting one gift per gift-giver as both a Christmas gift and a birthday gift.\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] provides a \"lovely\" image for the people turning 27 on this date (Christmas Day, 2009) that would surely have them reaching for the brain bleach. He describes the prospective 27-year old reader's mother naked, immediately before the sexual encounter in which the reader was conceived. Such a sexual encounter may have been expedited by the (compulsory) seclusion enforced by the blizzard that ravaged New York and New England (where Randall is from) in April 1982 - the blizzard left some people trapped in the houses by snow-drifts and blocked transport for days on end. Given the severity, unexpected nature and location of the blizzard, Randall might well have heard about it as a child, as he was born a mere two years after the event.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[On one side, a family of four gathered around a Christmas tree, the daughter and son looking excitedly at the presents under the tree; on the other, a character wearing a party hat, sitting dejectedly before a birthday cake. The panel edges are decorated with holly and a wreath.]\n:<big><big>Happy Birthday</big></big>\n:to those of you born on the 25<sup>th</sup>!\n\n:Sorry you get kinda shafted \n:by the overlap with Christmas.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Christmas]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
