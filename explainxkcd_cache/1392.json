When the tournament began, he promptly became the first member of said club, and over the years it accumulated a large and illustrious roster.\n}}\n{{TOC}}A [http://xkcd.com/1392/large larger version] of this image can be found by clicking the image on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com].\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic shows the rise and fall of players' strengths in two games, {{w|basketball}} and {{w|chess}}.  For chess, there is an overall chart, and a women's chart. For basketball, it uses the {{w|player efficiency rating}} (PER), the [http://knickerblogger.net/a-laymans-guide-to-advanced-nba-statistics/ most commonly used player statistic]. Note that that player efficiency ratings and similar \"aggregate scores\" are the subject of much discussion in basketball due to {{w|Player efficiency rating#Problems with PER|known efficiencies}}. For chess, it uses the {{w|Elo rating}}. Elo was adopted by the World Chess Federation, {{w|FIDE}}, in 1970, so the rating is extrapolated backwards in time (among other methods, such as using [https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Kenneth+Wingate+Regan Kenneth Regan's] computer analysis - as written in the Chess panel) and are thus shown as dashed lines prior to 1970. The charts show the players career paths as a function of time with the rating on the y-axis. There is no [[#Scales of the axis|scale on the y-axis]].\n\n[[#Player inclusion criteria|Included]] are mainly players that could be said to have been among the dominating players at some time in their career. If a player has been the best player over a longer time period (a seriously dominating player) then their career path will be drawn in red, the rest are in gray. There can be more than one red path at a time, but only because the dominating player has played before or after they became dominating. It seems like it has to be at least five years, as there are at least two players that have been no. 1 for four years, without being upgraded to a red curve. The only ones that have managed this with three years or less (on the chart) are those that begin the chart, and thus could have been no. 1 a few years before. This can all be seen in the '''[[#Data tables|data tables]]''' below.\n\nThe title text mentions {{w|Vera Menchik}} who is also the first female chess player listed at the left of the bottom panel. In January 1926 she won the first Girls' Open Championship at the Imperial Club in London, but as can be seen in the last panel she was killed near the end of World War II, 38-year-old, while still holding the title of women's world champion. She, her sister, and mother were killed in a {{w|V-1 flying bomb}} attack which destroyed their home in 1944. \n\nThe title text mentions her specifically because of the club named after her: {{w|Vera_Menchik#The_.22Vera_Menchik_Club.22|The \"Vera Menchik Club\"}}. When in 1929, Menchik entered the {{w|Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament|Carlsbad}}, usually a tournament only for male chess players, one of the other chess players, Viennese master {{w|Albert Becker (chess player)|Albert Becker}}, ridiculed her entry by proposing that any player whom Menchik defeated in tournament play should be granted membership into the Vera Menchik Club. In the same tournament, Becker himself became the first member of the \"club\", much to his ridicule. It should be noted that she did end in last place vs. his fifth place, but that must just have made the defeat even tougher to take for Albert.\n\nAlbert was the first, but far from the last male chess player to enter the Vera Menchik Club. No less than 19 other male chess players are listed on Wikipedia belonging to this club, amongst them {{w|Max Euwe}} who went on to become World Chess Champion (1935–37). So it can for sure be said that the club accumulated a \"large and illustrious roster\". One and a half year later a comic, named after {{w|Magnus Carlsen}}, was released ([[1628: Magnus]]). This comics also compares chess players (Magnus) to other (sporting) events. Magnus was ranked no. 1 on the chess world rank when both comics were released.\n\n===Chess vs chess (women)===\nWhy is chess divided with men and women's graphs and basketball not? First of all, there is very little focus on women's basketball (as for most women's sport). This may be the same for chess, but at least here the physical strength advantage for men is no direct advantage. Thus a great woman chess player may play just as interesting chess as a man. Whereas women would typically have no chance if playing on a basketball team with men. But why are women then not represented better on the overall chess ranking? This is explained and may be another reason it is included. In the ''Chess (women)'' panel it says: \"For a long time, sexism, a lack of role models, and institutional hostility largely kept women from pursuing serious chess careers. With the expansion of women's tournaments and prizes starting in the 1970s, this has begun to change\". So now at least one woman has shown that her skills is enough to compete with the best men. With the long careers chess players usually have, then maternity leave can destroy a woman's chance at reaching the ultimate top. This could be the case for the number one woman who now has two children.\n\n===References on the career paths===\nThere are several references at given times of a career path. These can either be noted with:\n* A node on the path. An arrow will point to the note and state a fact.\n* A dashed path, not including chess player paths from before 1970 where they were all dashed as explained above. For basketball, an arrow will point to the dashed part and state a fact.\n* The {{w|Starburst (symbol)|starbursts}} at the beginning or end of a path. A fact will be stated next to the node. These are references to a player disappearing (or reappearing) in unusual circumstances in either Chess panel.\nSome of these are intended to provide context (such as \"Loses to Deep Blue\"), while others are tangents or jokes. These references are listed below in order of appearance. If it is a dashed line or a starburst, it will be mentioned.\n\n====Basketball====\n*{{W|Wilt Chamberlain}} – \"Becomes the first and so far only player to score {{w|Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|100 points in a game}}\". (In 1962)\n*{{w|Jerry West}} – \"The Guy in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NBALogo.svg The NBA logo]\" from 1969: read 5th paragraph in this {{w|National Basketball Association#Celtics' dominance, league expansion, and competition|wiki section}}\n*{{w|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar}} – \"{{w|Airplane (film)|Airplane}}\": A comedy film from 1980 where he played the co-pilot Roger Murdock.\n*{{w|Magic Johnson}} – \"{{w|Magic Johnson#HIV announcement and Olympics (1991–92)|HIV announcement}}\". This part of his path is dashed. The line is dashed from 1991 to 1995 - where the fear of AIDS forced him to retire.\n**He {{w|Magic Johnson#Return to the Lakers as coach and player (1994, 1996)|returned to play once more}} in the season from 1995-1996\n*{{w|Michael Jordan}} – \"{{w|Michael Jordan#First retirement and baseball career (1993–1994)|Baseball career}}\". This part of his path is dashed. From 1993–1994 he played Baseball - i.e. his first retirement.\n*Michael Jordan – \"{{w|Space Jam}}\". (An animated comedy film from 1996 starring {{w|Bugs Bunny}} and Jordan - who was the only live character during most of the movie)\n*Michael Jordan – \"{{w|Michael Jordan#Second retirement (1999–2001)|Second retirement}}\". This part of his path is dashed. (He retired again from 1999–2001.)\n**He then {{w|Michael Jordan#Washington Wizards comeback (2001–2003)|came back}} to play two more years from 2001–2003.\n*{{w|LeBron James}} – \"{{w|The Decision (TV special)|The Decision}},\" a television special from 2010 about a heavily hyped decision as to which team he would play for the next season.\n\n====Chess====\n*{{w|José Raúl Capablanca|José Capablanca}} – \"Terrifying chess God\". An arrow points to the left of the panel with his name and the note beneath it. He was considered one of the greatest chess players of all time. As he died in 1942 this lies just outside of the chart. Anyway he had his best years all the way back in 1921-1927 where he was world chess champion\n*{{w|Alexander Alekhine}} – This is the first starburst. There is no text except his name. He {{w|Alexander Alekhine#Final year and death|died in 1946}} in Portugal.\n*{{w|Bobby Fischer}} – \"Vanished...\" The second Starburst. (He did not actually vanish, but he did {{w|Bobby Fischer#Sudden obscurity|stop playing competitively}} for about 20 years starting in 1972.) This is probably a reference to the 1993 film {{w|Searching for Bobby Fischer}}, which is not actually about Fischer, but about a player who partly models his career on Fischer's. The name ''Searching for Bobby Fischer'' may lead people to believe Fischer literally vanished, but that is not the case.\n*Bobby Fischer – \"...Reappeared then vanished again. He had problems.\" This is written below a double starburst with a short line between. This is another reference to Fischer - there is no name or clear correlation, except the text that relates to the first reference. He {{w|Bobby Fischer#1992 Spassky rematch|resumed playing competitively}} in 1992 for a match. ''{{w|Bobby Fischer#Life as an émigré|He had problems}}'' is a simplistic description of issues and controversies in Fischer's later life, including an arrest warrant because he violated a U.S. embargo against Yugoslavia, unpaid taxes, controversy about his statements on {{w|Antisemitism|anti-semitism}}, and mental problems. The U.S. eventually revoked his passport, and he was jailed for eight months in Japan.  He then received Icelandic citizenship, and lived out the rest of his life there.\n*{{w|Garry Kasparov}} – \"Loses to {{w|Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue}}\". In 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer to {{w|Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov#1997 rematch|beat the current chess world champion}}\n*{{w|Judit Polgar}} – \"(see below)\". The text in the brackets is written beneath her name. She is the strongest woman chess player ever and can be seen rising from the gender-defined ranks of women's chess (below). She is the only women shown on this part of the chart. Below in the womans chart, there are several notes - see below.\n\n====Chess (women)====\n*{{w|Vera Menchik}} – \"Died in a missile attack on London\". This is the last starburst. She was killed in 1944 by an early guided missile - a {{w|V-1 flying bomb}} - launched by the Germans in {{w|World War II}}. For some reason her path does not seems to be dashed, as it should have been before 1970, but it may be simply because the dashes were obscured by her name. She is also mentioned in the title text, see above in the [[#Explanation|Explanation]].\n*{{w|Sonja Graf}} – \"Rating particularly uncertain\". This is written above her name, with an arrow pointing there. As a matter of fact, she was clearly the second best woman and her path should be parallel to Menchik's from 1930's. The path is already dashed indicating that it is a rough estimate, but there was probably very little data for woman chess players before 1960 explaining the note.\n*{{w|Kira Zvorykina}} – \"Kira Zvorykina (born 1919) continued playing in tournaments into the 21st century\". Zvorykina was never very high on the list, but can be seen twice centered on 1960 and 1980. She played her [http://ratings.fide.com/individual_calculations.phtml?idnumber=13500392&rating_period=2008-01-01&t=0 last game] rated by the {{w|World Chess Federation}} in October 2007 aged 88. She was still alive when this comic was released. Zvoryinka passed away in September 2014.\n**She is the only player in all three panels whose path falls below the panel only to enter again later. This second entry is labeled with her last name - Zvorykina - on top of the path. \n*Judit Polgar, {{w|Susan Polgar}} and {{w|Sofia Polgar}} – \"Sisters\". These three chess playing sisters are linked by a thin dashed line, snaking between their names on the chart. Judit is the youngest, Susan the oldest. Judit has now overtaken her sisters, Sofia never reaching the other two sisters' level.\n*Judit Polgar – \"{{w|Judit Polgar#Making history|Wins a game against Kasparov}}, making her the first woman to beat the world #1\". It took some attempts and some {{w|Judit Polgar#Kasparov touch-move controversy|controversy}} before she managed to beat Kasparov in 2002, in a tournament that was played under rapid rules with 25 minutes per game and a 10-second bonus per move.\n*Judit Polgar – \"Becomes first woman to rank in the overall top 10\". She is so far the only woman to break into the top 10 in the {{w|FIDE World Rankings}}. She ranked as high as {{w|Judit Polgar#Combining family and chess|eighth in the world}} in 2005.\n\n===Scales of the axis===\nThe '''x-axis''' is divided in decades from 1950 until 2010. In the Basketball section the curves begins to appear right after 1950. For both chess panels there are curves further back than 1950 (with even a reference to a player from before 1940). For all three panels the paths continue up till present day (2014).\n\nIn all cases there is no scale on the '''y-axis''' with the rating, thus it is difficult to find the absolute scale. It is also difficult to compare between the two chess panels. The scale on the two chess panels are, however, the same, as can be seen by comparing the curve of Judit Polgar on each chart. This curve is exactly the same, with the same elevation between the point where her curve enters the Chess panel up to the top point. This also means that any women player whose curve rises above this entry point (around 1989) should also be visible in the Chess chart. See below for inclusion criteria.\n\n===Player inclusion criteria===\nIn general not all possible players are included in these charts. For instance it is mentioned that Judit Polgar was the first woman ranked in the overall top 10. But only six players are shown on the overall chart around 2005, where she was ranked 8th. So some male players, better than her at that time, have not been included. This is a general trend for all three charts.\n\nFrom the women's panel below it is also clear that some of the other women would be ranked high enough to be visible on the upper chart as mentioned in the [[#Scales of the axis|Scales]] section above. But still only Judit is shown there. 9 out of 12 of the women that are on the chart after 1989 would be visible if included in the overall chart. However, none of them could be called dominant when comparing to the best men in the same time period. And thus they are not included. Maybe the same could be said about Judth, but then she is included for scale, and because she is so good that she can compete with, and sometimes beat, the best.\n\nSome NBA players (like {{w|Tim Duncan}}, {{w|Charles Barkley}}, {{w|Oscar Robertson}}, {{w|Kobe Bryant}}, and {{w|Chris Paul}}) have been left out of the chart in favor of players with lower career and yearly efficiency ratings.\n\nSimilarly can be mentioned for instance the no. 1 ranked chess player {{w|Veselin Topalov}} from Bulgaria, who was ranked first both in 2006-2007 and in 2008-2010 for a total of less than two years. And there are likely several others ([[#Where is Viswanathan Anand|see below]]).\n\nAn example of the above for basketball would be the 2008–2009 season which was unique in that it was the only season in which more than one player posted an efficiency ratings of over 30.0 on the Player efficiency rating (see at the bottom of {{w|Player efficiency rating#Reference guide|this section}} on Wikipedia). In that season three players broke this barrier: LeBron James (31.76), {{w|Dwyane Wade}} (30.46), and Chris Paul (30.04). LeBron is shown to top that season, but Dwyane is far below (thus the scale does not fit?) and Chris is not on the list at all (i.e. he was not deemed to be a dominant player).\n\nSo is this [[Randall|Randall's]] subjective list of players that he has deemed to be \"dominant players\" and not a full list of the best ranked players during the time period? Of course it is his choice which players he put into the list, but missing players (when worse has been included earlier) can be explained if the missing players never were among the most dominant player over a length of time. It is not a list of the best players of all time, or of a single season, but a chart of the dominant players over a longer time period.\n\nFor basketball any given player will at least have been the 2nd best (of those included) at some (longer) period of their career. And to become selected for a red curve, they need to be the best for at least five years - the first players curve is no. 1 less than five year, but he could have been no. 1 also before 1951.\n\nThe same is valid for the chess players (again the first player's curve is red, but stops just as it enters the panel). Only exception is Judit Polgar. She is never better than 3rd of those selected. And she was never better than 8th in the world. So her inclusion is mentioned probably only to compare her with the men.\n\nFor the women chess players, there are the same criteria for red, except that Sonja Graf is not red although she is the only chess player on the list for more than a decade. Maybe you need to be better than someone else to become red? There are also included several women who never reach 2nd place on the chart. Three of these reach 3rd place and two only 4th. One of these, Anna Muzychuk, is still on the rise, so she might be on the chart, because she could possibly become first or second if she can continue to improve. The other, Sofia Polgar, is included to show that all three Polgar sisters are chess masters.\n\n====Where is Viswanathan Anand?====\nNone of the above can explain why former World Champion Chess Grandmaster {{w|Viswanathan Anand}} has not been included in the Chess Chart. Anand is one of only thirteen players in history to break the 2800 mark on the FIDE rating list and and still (as of 2020) has the eighth highest FIDE ranking at peak ever. He occupied the number one position in several rating lists between 2007 and 2011. The reason could possible be because Randall may be a huge fan of Magnus Carlsen, and thus biased against Anand. However, since the release of [[1628: Magnus]], named after Magnus, there can be no doubt that Randall is a fan of Magnus.\n\nAnand can for instance be found in the {{w|Chessmetrics}} devised by statistician {{w|Jeff Sonas}}. In the [http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp graph from 1995-2005] of Sonas famous research from 2005, Anand becomes the best during 2004. It can, however, also be seen that Randall does not agree with Sonas - this is very clear in this [http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=194020SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 graph from 1940-1960]. Here Mikhail Botvinnik clearly plays way better than Alexander Alekhine in 1946, where Alexander dies. This is not shown like this in the comic. Maybe the death of Alexander becomes the more interesting in the comic, if you believed he was the best at the time. Note that all nine (male) names listed in the comics chart between the lines at 1950 and 2000 are included in this [http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=195050SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 graph from 1950-2000]. In this chart it is clear that Bobby Fischer was by far the best in the years before he disappeared. However, he was caught by {{w|Anatoly Karpov}} just before which is not shown in the comic. On the other hand, he seems to have reached a significant higher rating than Kasparov ever did, which is also not the case in the comic.\n\n===Entwined career paths===\nChess players {{w|Vladimir Kramnik}} and {{w|Levon Aronian}}, who have faced each other on multiple occasions in the 2010s, are shown as having their career paths entwined. It is a general trend observed every time two players paths cross each other more than once. The one on top the first time, will be below the second time and so forth. It is just more clear with these two than anywhere else. In two cases these crossing path occurs with so long time between the first appearance, that the names is written twice on the path. In the Chess panel it is {{w|Mikhail Tal}} and {{w|Boris Spassky}} and for the Chess (women) panel it is {{w|Pia Cramling}} and {{w|Xie Jun}}. This can make it difficult to get an overview of how few chess players there are compared to basketball players.\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''Dominant players '''\n:over time\n:[Below this heading there are three panels with charts showing different players career paths - that is their rating a function of the year. Most of the paths are grey, but some are red (there will be a note for these). Some parts of several paths are dashed. Somewhere on each path the players name will be written curving along so it follows the path. Several places an event or some information is noted and points to a given time on the path. If it is not clear where it belongs an arrow will point to the correct place. Each chart has a heading and for the two last charts there is an explanation. There is no scale on the y-axis (rating) but the x-axis (time) has the years given in ten years interval. A thin line indicates these decades.

The 20th century is the 1900s in which Zvorkina was born, on September 29th, 1919. Randall has corrected the notation to say \"into the 21st century\".\n*The names of three NBA players have been misspelled: {{w|Neil Johnston}} (misspelled as \"Neal\"), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (missing hyphen), and {{w|Julius Erving}} (misspelled \"Irving\".)\n*The order of the names of an Indian chess playing woman has been given in the native version in the comic, where the western version would use the reverse as here: {{w|Humpy Koneru}}.\n===Data tables===\n*Below are three sortable tables, with the original order as the players name appear in the transcript i.e. chronological.\n*One of the objectives of the tables is to make it clear what is the criteria for a player obtaining a red path. Thus there is an x for red path and an x for being no. 1 on the charts. Also the number if years a player has been no. 1 is given.\n*All data in these tables are taken from the comic - except the names - they are taken from Wikipedia. See trivia items above.\n*The total years as no. 1 is not the same in each table, as those players entering the panels from outside (before 1942), do not get a length of time as being no. 1. For basketball the chart first begins in 1951 (together with the rating system?)\n**Since the years as no. 1 has been roughly estimated from the charts (with a ruler) the sum total can also not be expected to fit with the first entry and today (and they miss with at least a couple of years each), as all years have been rounded to the nearest whole year.\n*In the comments column, there is references to the relevant section in the explanation if there are any notes/references in the comic for the player.
