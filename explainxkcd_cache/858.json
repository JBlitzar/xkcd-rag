Without any preamble, Megan answers a question that has not been asked, pointing out to Cueball that he would not be able to obtain milk from her breasts right now, as she is not {{w|lactation|lactating}}.  Cueball is flabbergasted that she seems to have read his mind, as this was exactly what he was wondering.\n\nMegan, like any healthy adult female {{w|mammal}}, is capable of producing milk from her {{w|mammary glands}}. She does not need to be pregnant in order to lactate; some women are able to lactate before getting pregnant, but being pregnant will increase the chances of her being able to lactate.\n\nThe title text indicates that this is not proof of Megan's psychic powers, as Cueball seems quite obsessed with this particular topic, although, if you interpret it as a response to Cueball's thoughts in the last panel it could remain ambiguous.\nAlternatively it could mean that Megan and Cueball are having the same thoughts 40 or 50% of the time and thus it's actually easy for her (or actually both) to guess his thoughts.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Couple sitting opposed, Megan on couch reading book and Cueball a chair with a laptop.]\n:Megan: The fact that I have breasts doesn't mean you could milk me now. I'd have to be lactating.\n:[A beat passes.]\n: [In the third panel, Megan's legs are not seen, probably tucked under the armchair to feel more secure.]\n:Cueball (thinking): Oh my god she's psychic.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Someone being mistakenly considered a psychic, while their statement is only by chance was already the punchline of [[628: Psychic]], 1.5 years earlier.\n*Making random statements and surprising people in case they are true is also the setup in [[525: I Know You're Listening]] and [[2203: Prescience]]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
