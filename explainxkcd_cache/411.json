This is for the many repetitions in techno music, usually repeating it 4 (or other powers of two) times.\n\nThe title text refers to the clicking and grinding noises of a dying hard drive, a sound similar to some techno songs. The title text suggests that this actually exists.\n\nTechno music is also mentioned in [[586: Mission to Culture]] and [[740: The Tell-Tale Beat]]. Sampling and looping sounds that aren't necessarily musical is mentioned in [[2427: Perseverance Microphones]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball looking over Megan's shoulder while she is clicking her mouse with her other hand on her chin.]\n:Cueball: Wait, you're buying techno on iTunes?\n:Megan: Yeah. So?\n:Cueball: Couldn't you just loop the 15-second free sample 20 times and get basically the same thing?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
