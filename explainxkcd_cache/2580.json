Put a hot washcloth on your forehead, remain standing, and breathe dry air while taking lots of histamines. You need to give your body a chance to get sick again.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Black Hat]] congratulates [[Cueball]] on his recovery from some type of illness or injury. Common advice when someone is sick is to get plenty of rest and drink lots of water, to aid recovery and to ensure they don't ignore various common causes of fluid loss.\n\nHowever, being Black Hat, he targets Cueball (who has been restored to full health) to tell him that he now should do the opposite of this. While a healthy person should get a reasonable amount of exercise, and should not spend excessive time in bed, Black Hat goes to an absurd extreme.  He tells Cueball to stop drinking water entirely and engage in an excessive amount of activity â€” in this case, by running on a {{w|treadmill}} to the point of physical collapse. The caption explains this, saying that it is \"important\" to tell people who have recently recovered from sickness to stop resting and drinking fluids, suggesting that these behaviors are for the exclusive purpose of healing and that they are useless (or even counter-productive) for someone who is now healthy.\n\nPart of the joke may be that the most basic common and basic advice to people who are sick is good, general advice in any case. While a person who's sick should be particularly attentive to these needs, and will generally require more rest than a person who's healthy, getting adequate rest and hydration are important for maintaining health, not just recovering from illness, and pursuing the opposite would be dangerous.\n\nThe title-text expands on this backward line of thinking by suggesting to do the opposite of common remedies for various usual remedies: a hot cloth, standing, breathing parched air, taking {{w|histamines}} (this is as opposed to reducing fever with a cool compress, resting in bed, inhaling hot water vapors and using {{w|antihistamine}}s). These are increasingly bizarre.  A hot cloth on the forehead would range from useless to dangerous (if too hot, it could cause burns or overheating).  Remaining standing isn't harmful for most people, but would soon become exhausting.  Breathing dry air isn't harmful for most people, but without adequate water would dehydrate you even faster.  Histamines are compounds created in the body that regulate the immune system. They're generally not available as a supplement so it would be difficult to \"take\" histamines. If you could somehow raise your histamine levels artificially, it could interfere with any number of bodily functions.  \n\nThis comic has some resemblance to [[2279: Symptoms]] since it also makes a joke out of symptoms or the opposite of symptoms. Although not mentioned here, this comic is probably, like Symptoms, related to the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}, as many people were still sick with it at the time of publishing this comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Black Hat are talking to each other.
