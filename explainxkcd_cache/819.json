The series is composed of four comics, released between in November 2010 and August 2011. They are listed here for convenience:\n*[[819: Five-Minute Comics: Part 1]]\n*[[820: Five-Minute Comics: Part 2]]\n*[[821: Five-Minute Comics: Part 3]]\n*[[Five-Minute Comics: Part 4]]\n\nThe caption above the comic explains the circumstances which led to this series' release. Here are the explanations for each of the small comics and the title text:\n\n; Comic #1\n\n: In astronomy, an \"approach\" is when two bodies come abnormally close to one another, but not close enough to crash. {{w|Jupiter}}, as most probably know, is the fifth planet in our solar system. Its approach to Earth in September 2010 was the closest seen in many years - in fact, the next time it will come that close will be in 2022. In the comic, this is indicated by Jupiter hovering right above Earth and talking to the characters. Of course, Jupiter is not only planet-sized, but is ''enormous'' compared to Earth; in fact, Earth would fit quite comfortably into the {{w|Atmosphere of Jupiter#Great Red Spot|red spot}} of Jupiter. Gravitational slingshots are used by deep-space probes to gain speed by approaching a planet and then leaving that planet; the gravity fields of the sun and the planet changes the trajectory of the probe, and the end result is an extremely fuel-efficient way of gaining speed during space travel. Jupiter is commonly used for this purpose because it's the most massive planet in our solar system.\n\n; Comic #2\n\n: The comic in the middle left features the lyrics to the Johnny Cash song {{w|A Boy Named Sue}}, but with \"Sue\" replaced with \"Trig.\" Inexplicably, Trig is a name that people actually give their children. The most notable example in the US - and probably the inspiration for Randall drawing this comic - is Trig Palin, the son of Alaskan politician Sarah Palin. Trig is also a widely accepted abbreviation for the mathematical field of {{w|trigonometry}}, and it sounds similar to \"twig,\" so one can imagine how a person with such a name might be ridiculed.\n\n; Comic #3\n\n: A child getting trapped in a well is an alien experience to some parts of the Western world, but it's quite a serious problem in places where wells are commonplace. Here, though, rather than attempt to rescue the little girl, Cueball instead tries to grant her wish of owning a pony before her imminent demise; a pony is a stereotypical thing for a little girl to want. Of course, since ponies don't fit into wells too easily,{{cn}} he has to stuff it in, which appears to be quite painful for the pony.\n\n; Comic #4\n\n: The server room of a large datacenter would be an unusual place to return \"back to nature\", to say the least. {{w|Reintroduction}} refers to the process of taking a population of animals raised in captivity and bringing them back to the wild; this is a delicate process, as being raised in captivity affects the natural development of skills the animal needs to survive. In fact, Wikipedia has a page specifically about the challenges of {{w|wolf reintroduction}}. Needless to say, reintroducing wolves to a server room is neither a good idea nor OSHA-approved. Cueball may also be referencing a computer program named \"reintroduction\" or something similar when he says \"We started a reintroduction program\". \n\n; Comic #5\n\n: Directly below the previous comic, Cueball is telling a \"yo mama\" joke. Such jokes are usually told in jest, and aren't really targeted at a particular person's mother; however, in this case, Cueball ''was'' attempting to make an honest observation about the listener's mother, and when he discovers his mistake, he realizes that she is, in fact, quite a nice person. Alternatively, Cueball is insulting the femininity of the listener's mother, and the masculinity of the listener's father.\n\n; Comic #6\n\n: {{w|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}} wrote an opera called ''{{w|The Magic Flute}}'', though the comic seems to attribute it to {{w|Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach}}. {{w|Richard Wagner}} wrote a series of operas called {{w|Der Ring des Nibelungen}}, or, more commonly, the ring cycle. Here, Randall interprets the ring cycle as some kind of motorcycle, while the teleporting magic flute comes from video games: in both ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the player can obtain a magic flute item that has teleportation powers. In the Magic Tree House series, the magic flute is an actual magical flute that does magic when played, although it does not teleport people. The caption implies that even Randall is not sure what meaning this comic has. However, as he has made a mash up of Mozart, Bach and Wagner - this must be intentional - so ''he'' does not attribute the Magic Flute to Bach! Also, due to the anachronistic nature of this comic, it could imply a pun, where they are going \"Bach to the future.\"\n\n; Comic #7\n\n: This comic shows how people rate the \"hotness\" of girls. Glamour magazines have desensitized many people to photo-edited models with large amounts of make-up, so the model gets a \"meh\" reaction. The girl in biology class, by contrast, is not only \"real\" by comparison, but is actually a viable choice for dating, so she is given a 2 star rating. If the same girl from bio class is wearing your shirt, that usually means you've had sex the night before, and she spent the night at your apartment, hence the need to get dressed in one of your shirts; this possibility earns the highest rating, 4 stars. Here it starts taking a turn for the worse. If wearing one of ''your'' shirts means she spent the night with ''you'', logically, wearing one of your ''mom's'' shirts means she spent the night with ''your mom''. This earns a \"Wat!\" reaction. Finally, human skin is not generally designed to detach from its owner.{{Citation needed}} If the girl from your bio class is wearing your mom's skin like a suit, it means she probably murdered your mom and skinned her. This is a reference to serial killer {{w|Ed Gein}}, who (among other things) made suits out of the skin of some of his victims. To this, Cueball can only scream.\n\n; Title text\n\n: The title text refers to the wolves thinning the RAID array. A {{w|RAID|RAID array}} is a way of spreading data redundantly across multiple hard drives, such that 100% of the data is still recoverable if some number of drives go down. This number can be set arbitrarily, as long as you have at least one more disk than the number you want, but it reduces your total storage space accordingly. The seek speed of a drive is how fast it can find a specific point of data on its platter; thus, the wolves are essentially killing the slowest drives, implementing a kind of natural selection to \"evolve\" the drives to be faster. \"Thinning the RAID array\" is a play on words. In the ecological sense, it refers to eliminating some members of the population to allow the remaining ones to thrive more successfully. In the datacenter sense, \"thin provisioning\" refers to the practice of marking an intent to use disk storage for a specific purpose but allowing it to be used for something else until actually needed (as opposed to \"thick provisioning\" which immediately reserves the storage space, even if unused).\n\n==Transcript==\nBecause of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes. -- Randall\n\n====Comic #1====\n:[Cueball and Megan stand facing each other.]\n:Cueball: Jupiter will make its closest approach to Earth in decades.\n:[Cueball points behind Megan, and she turns around.]\n:Cueball: In fact, here it comes now!\n:[Jupiter, about the size of the characters' heads, hovers into the frame at about head-height.]\n:Jupiter: Hey, guys.\n:[Jupiter continues to hover through the frame as the characters watch it go.]\n:Jupiter: Anyone need a gravitational slingshot?\n:Megan: No, I'm good.\n:Jupiter: Aight.\n\n====Comic #2====\n:[Cueball sits on a box, playing a guitar.]\n:Cueball: ...Now I don't blame him 'cause he ran and hid,\n:Cueball: but the meanest thing that he ever did\n:Cueball: was before he left, he went and named me \"Trig.\"\n\n====Comic #3====\n:[Cueball looks down a well.]\n:Cueball: Oh God, a little girl is trapped down this well!\n:[Cueball runs off screen.]\n:[Cueball returns, leading a pony.]\n:Cueball: It's okay, we got you that pony you always wanted!\n:[Cueball tries to cram the pony down the well with the aid of a large stick.]\n:Cueball: Get... in... there...\n:Cueball: Ugh!\n\n====Comic #4====\n:[Cueball and Megan stand in a server room. ]\n:Cueball: I like to get back to nature by coming out here to the server room.\n:Cueball: The warmth, the whirr of the drives, the drone of the fans, the howl of the wolves...\n:Megan: Wolves?\n:Cueball: Yeah, we started a reintroduction program.\n:Wolf: Awoooooo\n\n====Comic #5====\n:[Cueball stands by himself in the frame.]\n:Cueball: Yo momma's so masculine that she... oh, wait, that's your dad.\n:Cueball: Is your mom the lady over by the door?
