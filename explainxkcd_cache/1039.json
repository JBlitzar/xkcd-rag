Calling the pre-chosen \"safe word\" would be a sign to stop. To prevent accidental usage, people generally pick words that they wouldn't normally use, such as \"Pineapple\" or \"Hedgehog.\" In the case of this comic, the characters are chemists, and the uncommon word they happen to have chosen is {{w|RuBisCO|Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase}}, also known as RuBisCO (which actually isn't a very uncommon word in the scientific world, as it's the most abundant {{w|protein}} on earth, but it would be uncommon to use the full word). However, the length of the word makes it impractical for a safe word, as it would take too long to say; indeed, using the shorter form \"RuBisCO\" would normally be a fine safe word.\n\nThe joke of this comic is that the first thing the reader sees is a seemingly random long word spoken, with the speaker off screen. The meaning is mysterious until [[Megan]] reveals it. This appears to be a regular occurrence, as [[Cueball]] and Megan go back to work with no questions asked.\n\nThe title text mentions {{w|Bruce Schneier}}, a computer security professional, and public keys which is the publicly known half of {{w|public-key cryptography}}, which uses two mathematically linked keys to decrypt information. The joke is that Schneier considers safewords as a type of security and thus believes they are not safe enough and recommends the key signature. However, whereas it takes a long time to say RuBisCO in full during your submission, it would be impossible to use any public keys to stop your partner.\n\nRandall later in [[1128: Fifty Shades]] referenced the book {{w|Fifty Shades of Gray}} which made the concept of {{w|Safeword|'safe words'}} perhaps more widely known to the mainstream public. Here the word is very short: Red.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Person in background (out-of-frame) screams out this word over all 3 panels.]\n\n:[Cueball is working on a laptop at a desk.
