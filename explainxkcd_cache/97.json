The lyrics are ridiculous.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe song on the radio is \"{{w|Welcome to My Life}}\" by {{w|Simple Plan}} (not A Simple Plan), which was released in 2004 as a first single from the band's second album \"{{w|Still Not Getting Any...}}\" The lyrics of the song mainly deal with the frustration of adolescence and the stress of newfound independence. Many, if not all, adolescents go through a phase where the ongoing realization of becoming fully responsible for their body, mind, and personality frightens them.\n\nSimple Plan's lyrics seem particularly inappropriate and ridiculous, given that the members of the band are all in their 30s. The absurdity of middle-aged men expressing teen angst could be interpreted as a spoof or parody, which Cueball mistakenly believes to be the truth. In the comic, Cueball slowly comes to the horrifying realization that the members of the band are actually ''seriously'' whining about the typical life of a spoiled teenager, rather than parodying them.\n\nIn the title text, Randall states that this was his own reaction to the song, and that he now considers it ridiculous.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball, standing in front of stool with a radio on it.]\n:Radio: You don't know what it's like to be me!\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:At first, I loved ''A Simple Plan''. Then I realized, with creeping horror, that they were serious.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
