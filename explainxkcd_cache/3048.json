Such a cable, or parallel cables, can span a large gap, across which an {{w|Arch_bridge|arch}} (with compressive forces) or {{w|Cantilever_bridge|cantilever}} (with compression below and tension above) bridge structure would be more difficult. The slung droop of the connection, and various other issues (the susceptibility to resonance from moving loads, as well as the sheer impracticality of travelling along this link) means that the surface of the usual road itself (or footway, in the case of a {{w|Arouca 516|non-vehicular bridge}}) is suspended from this cable by vertical (and perhaps diagonal) suspending stringers of suitable lengths to maintain a more level track. This usually means that the greatest clearance beneath the traversable part of the bridge is not far below the middle of the main curve of the cable, which has the closest (or direct) attachment to the bridging 'deck'. Unlike the free-hanging cable, the addition of the weight of the road and the large number of vertical cables required now forces the cable to take the path of a similar parabolic curve, rather than a true catenary, and may also have to further flex significantly according to wind, temperature and the changing loads of passing traffic with significant mass.\n\nRandall suggests 'improving' the suspension bridge by having ''just'' the catenary curve, needing much less structure, and giving an increased clearance for anything passing beneath (in this case, a tall-masted sailboat) if they pass closer to the supporting towers. This, of course, means that the traffic can ''only'' cross where the upper cables themselves were, seemingly having been replaced by the road deck judging by the double lines in this side-section view. Due to the steep nature of the way the new road deck must pass over the supports, this produces a steep gradient up to and then down from the tower which sends traffic temporarily onto a free ballistic trajectory, assuming it has enough speed. This is described as \"fun jumps\", {{w|Bug (engineering)#\"It's not a bug, it's a feature\"|as if it is how bridges ''should'' work}}. This would likely inflict damage on the car, and might result in unfortunate accidents. Some bridges are designed for traffic to go on top with a {{w|Stressed ribbon bridge|cable underneath}}, but these are only used for shorter spans and can flex significantly.{{cn}}\n\nThe title text suggests a gradual introduction of this new form of bridge, a practice which is common when introducing new large-scale societal changes. According to Randall, the bridges would at first be a sort of hybrid between the old and new design, where any driver could choose between taking the catenary curve or driving along the tried-and-true flat road. As more and more people sample the \"fun jumps\" path, he claims, word will spread about how much 'better' this path is, and once it's been widely adopted, the flat road will be discontinued. In reality, a more likely result would be that drivers who take the catenary curve quickly spread word about how ''dangerous'' this path is (and/or spread themselves, and their wrecked vehicles, all around the terrain that the bridge is supposed to cross), and any usage would quickly disappear.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In one panel two different designs of suspension bridges are shown in cross section one above the other.] \n\n:[At the top a normal suspension bridge is drawn. It spans a water way with two towers about a quarter of the way from the banks on either side. The distance from the road part of the bridge to the water is about a third of the total distance from the bridge to the bottom of the water. The suspension cables goes above the straight road up to the top of the towers in a curve and almost down to the road in between the towers. Vertical suspenders (cables) hangs down from the suspension cables holding the road in place (8 on either side and 17 between the towers). On the road there are ten vehicles going either way, evenly spread out across the part of the bridge that are over water. There is a large truck, a smaller truck, a van and then 7 regular cars. Above the drawing is a caption:]\n:Traditional suspension bridge:\n\n:[Beneath this a different version of a suspension bridge is drawn. It spans the same water way, and also has the same two towers. But here ends the similarities. Instead of suspension cables holding a straight road, the road is now build in the same curve that the cables had in the first drawing. So the cars need to drive up to the top of the towers along a curves road and then down again in the middle between the towers. There are thus no cables of any kind. And no straight road at a fixed height above the water. On this hilly road there are also ten vehicles going either way. To the left three regular cars are driving up the steep incline toward the left tower. A fourth car has just past over the top, and a dotted line behind it indicates that it is flying above the road after having speed over the top. In the middle of the road between the towers where it is closest to the water, there is a large truck also going towards the right. The road is clearly bending under the weight of the truck. Near the top of the right tower another regular car is driving up the incline.  Just above it near the top of the right tower another car has made a large jump out from the top of the tower going left, a dotted line indicating a quite high jump taking it a couple of car heights above the top of the tower. On the right side of the tower, two cars (one very small) drives left up towards the tower and behind them a final car drives down towards the right bank. There are three labels. The first is beneath the first section of the bridge to the left, where three arrows points to the underside of the road with the label beneath these arrows. The second is just right of the left tower where a double arrow indicate the height of the road above the water. An arrow point up to this arrow from the label that are written down in the water. Near the right tower, in the same spot as the double arrow is near the left tower, there is a sail boat with a high sail that can pass under the road near the tower, where the road is higher up than in the middle (or all the way in the normal version drawn above). The third label is written above the right tower, where an arrow points from the label to the dotted line of the car that makes the high jump from the top of the tower.
