'oh, like a boat!' '...' 'Just for the sake of argument, we should get a boat! You can invite the Devil, too, if you want.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Ponytail]] is trying to get [[Cueball]] to consider a hypothetical situation, for the sake of argument. It appears that Cueball is questioning the wisdom of doing so, and postulating that assuming unreal hypotheses for the sake of argument is a stupid thing to do, because it causes more arguments. Ponytail then claims she is playing the Devil's advocate, and Cueball again lambastes her for advocating for somebody as unsympathetic as the Devil.\n\nIn a debate or discussion, to play the {{w|Devil's advocate}} is to take a position with which you do not necessarily agree (and typically which no one involved in the argument agrees) to allow further exploration of the subject. As the title text starts to explain, it can be a device used to explore a different viewpoint to gain a wider understanding. Arguing for a view with which you do not agree can provoke a re-evaluation, or conversely a re-affirmation of your previously held view by considering the merits of the potential counter-argument. To be able to play the Devil's advocate convincingly is the mark of a well-rounded debater.\n\nHowever, Cueball interprets her statement literally, thus assuming she is arguing on the side of the {{w|Devil}}, the religious entity defined as pure evil. Obviously, it would be ill advised to take his side during a debate.{{Citation needed}}\n\nCueball then pulls an ironic twist on Ponytail by revealing that he was questioning Ponytail's argumentative style for the sake of argument himself. The comic actually plays on the double meaning of \"argument\": Ponytail refers to a statement in a debate while Cueball suggests a quarrel in the last panel.\n\nIn the title text, an exasperated Ponytail is trying to explain to Cueball that she is trying to use these debating techniques as a device to explore and broaden her understanding of her reality or a plausible alternative. Cueball derails the conversation, by comparing these attributes to a boat, which also allows you to explore other areas and broaden your experiences and understanding (as mentioned earlier in [[209: Kayak]]). Ponytail is rendered speechless by this statement, and Cueball further suggests that they should get a boat, and that Ponytail can bring the Devil too.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail and Cueball are talking.]\n:Ponytail: Just for the sake of argument, let's say that—\n:Cueball: —wait, for the sake of what?\n:[Panel zooms to only show Cueball.]\n:Ponytail: Argument.\n:Cueball: Ok, cool, that's ''totally'' a good reason to say something that's wrong. Gotta have arguments.\n:[Panel returns to original view.]\n:Ponytail: I'm just playing Devil's advocate.\n:Cueball: Ok. So you saw an argument where one side was the <em>Devil</em>, and you were like \"Man, ''that'' guy could use an advocate.\"\n:Ponytail: It's...''why'' are you being so difficult?\n:Cueball: For the sake of argument.\n:Ponytail: '''''Argh!'''''\n:Cueball: Yay, it's working!\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
