When he grew up as a child, the year 2000 seemed very far away — it was the future, but he now exists in that timeframe with the rest of society.\n\nThe title text states that \"the future\" was reached in 2004... Three years before the comic was published. This is possibly a joke on how time works, as \"the future\" is always, was always, and will always be ahead of the time you're in. There may, however, be a reference to some movie set in the future year 2004....\n\nThe 21<sup>st</sup> century, even the year 2004, was futuristic for people growing up in, for instance, the eighties. This view just belongs to the perspective of people — for people growing up in the '70s, even the novel {{w|Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984}} was futuristic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits silently in front of his computer.]\n:[Text block:]\n:I <u>still</u> do this every few months.\n\n:[He continues to sit for two more panels.]\n\n:Cueball: Holy crap, it's the 21st century.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
