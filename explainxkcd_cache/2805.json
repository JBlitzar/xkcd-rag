However, the trick is that he can use {{w|atmospheric circulation}} to roam across the globe, eventually drifting back over the basketball net after the passage of 1500 years. Of course, a normal human being would be {{w|Longevity claims|long dead after that time}}{{citation needed}}, and a normal balloon would [https://www.adamsgas.co.uk/2018/03/07/how-long-do-helium-balloons-float/ have lost all of its helium]. But, given [[:Category:Strange_powers_of_Beret_Guy|Beret Guy's special abilities]], it is presumed that he could indeed live that long. After waiting for several frames, Cueball is confused at Beret Guy drifting away under a balloon, and thus leaves the basketball court. In addition, Cueball would not be able to witness Beret Guy's shot anyway, as Cueball would be long dead. Beret Guy probably doesn't realize this at all, considering how na√Øve he is.\n\n[[File:Albuquerquebox.png|thumb|500px|right|The Albuquerque box effect: southerly winds at low altitudes and northerly winds at high altitudes allow balloonists to change direction by adjusting their altitude]]\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that players in this atmospheric circulation basketball game are allowed to maneuver to avoid falling back to the ground, but once players begin to exploit different windspeeds at different altitudes, they are \"traveling\". This is a joke on the rules of {{w|Traveling (basketball)|traveling}} in basketball, where players are allowed to hold the ball without dribbling for two steps before they have to pass or shoot. There's a new rule that allows for readjust that doesn't count as a step, which makes counting the number of steps difficult. It's largely left up to the referee to call. Here too it seems somewhat arbitrary, between adjusting altitude to avoid hitting the ground versus adjusting altitude to steer.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Beret Guy, holding a basketball and a helium balloon, is talking to Cueball. There is a basketball hoop at the right of the panel.]\n:Beret Guy: Check out my global atmospheric circulation trick shot!\n\n:[The panel centers on Beret Guy and Cueball, leaving the basketball hoop off-panel. Beret Guy continues to hold the basketball as he and his balloon rise from the ground and Cueball looks at him.]\n\n:[Beret Guy holding the balloon rises higher and floats toward the left as Cueball continues to look at him.]\n\n:[Cueball is alone. The basketball hoop is again shown at the right of the panel.]\n\n:[Cueball is alone.

Beret Guy, still holding his balloon and basketball, floats toward the right.]\n\n:[Beret Guy, still floating, throws the basketball downwards toward the basketball hoop.]\n\n:[The ball drops through the net as Beret Guy remains floating, now to the right of the hoop.]\n:''SWISH''\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Basketball]]\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]] <!-- Marginally assisted antigravity (see also Vacuum Energy, etc) and general patience with extreme longevity (see also \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\"/Time Capsule) -->\n[[Category:Weather]]"
