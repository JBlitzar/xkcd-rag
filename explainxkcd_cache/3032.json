The name comes from the temperature (T) lines being skewed at a 45-degree angle and the pressure (P) lines being logarithmic in scale. Although it ''looks'' very much like a cross-sectional diagram, it shows non-positional information derived from passing (generally) vertically up through the atmosphere from the initial reference location.\n\nBecause the diagrams have a lot of lines on them (isobars, isotherms, adiabats, and mixing ratios, and that's before plotting the actual measurements of temperature and dew point temperature), they can be hard to comprehend. The comic pretends to offer an explanation of one such diagram, but most of the explanations are blatantly incorrect or humorous in nature. The diagram appears to have either measurements from two separate weather measurements or the measured temperature and dewpoint from a single balloon, with solid lines for the primary balloon's two streams of data (often disambiguated by the chosen hue of the line) and dashed ones for the secondary set of data (popped balloon(s) falling back down, a separate second survey balloon rising or estimates derived from weather-radar data).  See details in the [[#Table with terms|table]] below. Many weather balloons are designed to rupture after reaching a certain height high in the atmosphere.\n\n[[File:Annotated_Skew_T_diagram.png|thumb|An actual Skew-T Log-P diagram, with several real annotations. The X-axis has temperature (blue diagonal lines in diagram) and the Y-axis has pressure in millibars.]]The true design of a Skew-T Log-P diagram is intended to best represent the nature of the weather in any given column of atmosphere. The pressure (vertical axis, with pressure being inversely related to altitude, more or less) is shown as a logarithmic scale (i.e., Log-P) because it makes altitudes nearly evenly spaced. Plotting pressure proportionately (which must also be from top to bottom, to match its general relationship with altitude) would space features out in ways that would be hard to use and interpret, whereas the logarithmic scale is far more pragmatic. The temperature scale is deliberately tilted, rather than orthogonal, which (together with the logarithmic nature of the inverted pressure scale) allows the typical way that temperatures fall with altitude(â‰ˆas pressure falls) to trend roughly vertically, give or take the notable changes that are key to understanding the forecast. Other measurement lines, differently skewed and often also curving across the temperature/pressure skewed-log 'grid', represent various other idealistic relationships (where both T and P vary, keeping another measure constant) that are useful references to meteorologists.\n\nUpon this style of graph are plotted the ''actual'' measurements obtained by releasing a weather balloon or through some other sensor. As well as the variation of actual temperatures and pressures, other retrieved and calculated data is plotted, such as the {{w|dew point}}. The dew point, a function of the air's {{w|absolute humidity|water content}}, temperature, and pressure, is where condensation begins. By observing how the actual measurements and dew point line converge and cross, the development and nature of clouds can be tracked and pinned to specific cloud layers. Further details may also be included, such as wind-direction and wind-speed indications (often to the side of the plot) to give a visual cue about possible {{w|wind shear}} and/or to suggest which direction of adjacent weather-station readings may hold clues as to what changes may later blow in above the current site.\n\nIn the title text it is stated that \"The most important quantity for meteorologists is of course the product of latent pressure and temperostrophic enthalpy, though 'how nice the weather is' is a close second\". So it jokes by comparing a non-existent, complicated-sounding product (temperostrophic enthalpy is not actually a thing) with a simple sentence about how nice the weather is.\n\n==Table with terms==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Item in comic\n!Correct?\n!Explanation\n|-\n| Pressure latitude || No || {{w|Pressure altitude|Pressure ''altitude''}} is the height above a standard datum plane, a theoretical level where the pressure of the atmosphere is 1013.24 millibars (29.921 inHg). It's essentially an estimate of altitude calculated from atmospheric pressure.\n|-\n| Enthalpic pressure || No || {{w|Enthalpy}} is the total internal energy of a thermodynamic system plus the product of the system's pressure and volume. Essentially, it represents the energy contained in a system, and is independent of the means or sequence of operations that the system went through to achieve its current state.\n|-\n| Entropic density || No || {{w|Entropy}} is a quantity that shows many physical processes can only go in one chronological direction. An egg can easily be scrambled (increasing its entropy), but it is very difficult to \"un-scramble\" an egg<sup>&#91;[[285: Wikipedian Protester|''citation needed'']]&#93;[[Category:Pages using the \"citation needed\" template]]</sup> (which would decrease its entropy). Ordered systems have low entropy, with differences in temperature, pressure, potential energy, or the like. Disordered systems have high entropy, without temperature, pressure, electrical, or other differentials.\n|-\n| Latent heat of cooling || No || {{w|Latent heat}} is the energy absorbed or released by a system during a '''constant-temperature''' process, like melting, freezing, boiling, or condensing. Cooling is a process of lowering a temperature, and therefore not a constant-temperature process. The humor comes considering the \"heat of cooling.\"\n|-\n| Isobars || Yes || Lines denoting equal (\"{{wiktionary|iso-}}\") air pressure (\"{{wiktionary|bar-|-bar}}\"), probably most often recognized as the indicators of how ground-level pressures change (or not) across the horizontal area depicted on a weather ''map''. In this type of chart, which depicts data obtained from above a single point, it has the same meaning but is instead a pre-existing reference line across which the actual data is plotted, and does not itself indicate the nature of any wind.\n|-\n| Omnitrophic wind || No || Something \"omnitrophic\" would apparently be \"all-eating\", in some scientific sense. An omnitrophic wind would probably be a concerning phenomenon.\nProbably a play on something like {{w|geostrophic wind}} (\"geo\"+\"strophic\" being from \"Earth curving\"), a theoretical state of wind that results from an exact balance between the {{w|Coriolis force}} and the {{w|pressure gradient}} force.\n|-\n| Isomers || No || Different forms of molecules with the same formula, with the atoms or functional groups arranged differently. For example, propanol with the basic formula of C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O, or propane with a single -OH functional group attached. There are two distinct positions that the hydroxyl group can sit, 1-propanol  has it at either end, while 2-propanol has it connected to the middle.\nHowever, these are actually iso'''therm''' lines, representing equal temperature.\n|-\n| These lines are slightly different because Dave messed them up || No || Indicating isotherms (or, according to the comic, \"isomers\"), the suggestion is that slightly wrong lines were drawn by Dave<!-- not Steve? I am surprised!--> and had to be corrected.\nThe real reason for the not quite identical lines is that the measured temperature at a given pressure can be converted to or from the ''potential'' temperature that the same air would have if at a standard pressure (holding the same amount of heat energy). For practical reasons, both for composing and interpreting the eventual plot, each of the slightly differently skewed isotherms are given, usually in clearly differentiable styles of line.\n\nThe \"Dave\" of the description may be David Bolton, whose [https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/108/7/1520-0493_1980_108_1046_tcoept_2_0_co_2.xml 1980 paper] introduced a means of calculating the atmosphere's potential temperature.\n|-\n| Line of constant thermodynamics || No || {{w|Thermodynamics}} is a branch of physics concerned with work, temperature, heat, the way they relate to entropy, energy, enthalpy, and the physical properties of radiation and matter. As a field of study, Thermodynamics does not have '''constant lines,''' except perhaps as a means of describing a consistent avenue of research.\n|-\n| Uncomfortably moist adiabat || Wrongly placed, unusually qualified|| This labels a segment of isotherm, which is the exact 'opposite' of an adiabat.\nAn adiabat is a line along which temperature can change for a given mass, without changing the amount of energy. This is primarily made possible by changing the density (by a change in pressure) of the gas. There are typically two types of adiabat, marked for reference on the plot, \"dry adiabat\" (curves across the isotherms perpendicularly, to create a largely square but slightly curved grid with them), and \"moist/saturated adiabat\" (the latter's heat-maintaining profile is influenced greatly by the humidity content, and produces graphing lines vastly different from the equivalent \"dry\" versions). Randall has declared this (erroneous) type of adiabat to be \"uncomfortably\" moist, so presumably not totally saturated but also not subjectively 'pleasant'.\n|-\n| Oops, the balloon flew through a ghost || No ||  One of the purported effects of ghosts (such as in the film *The Sixth Sense*) is a transient/local lowering of temperature around and/or inside them. The line is interpreted as showing a local low temperature encountered at this pressure(/altitude).\nThis line, however, is probably the dew point line, indicating that in passing through this layer of the atmosphere, a drier band of air was encountered which would theoretically be cooled a lot more before the water-vapor oversaturates it and liquid water droplets form.\n|-\n| No birds up here :( || Yes* || This point is near the top of the diagram, with an air pressure of about 110 millibar - about 15 kilometers (50,000 feet) above sea level. This is well above the highest [https://peregrinefund.org/explore-raptors-species/vultures/ruppells-vulture flight height of any known bird species]. However, this information is irrelevant to the purpose of a skew-T log-P diagram.\n|-\n| Track of rising weather balloon || Yes, partially || Although there are other ways of recording these details, this is typically the record of a rising balloon.\nHowever, it would be a track of the balloon through the varying pressures and temperatures that it records (as the second line of this type records the measurements of dew point at each pressure value). Moreover, circumstances that would make the recorded data plot out a neat {{w|figure-eight knot}} (see \"Seems bad\", below) are very unlikely.\n|-\n| Track of popped balloon falling back down || Possible, partially || A standard plot track will include two strong lines, as this has, representing not ''two'' balloons but the recorded temperature track ''and'' the dew point track, both against the (altitude surrogate) progressive pressure changes at each pressure-point.\nA further pair of tracks as dotted lines could possibly be from a different launch (earlier, later or simultaneous from an adjacent location) as an analytical reference, but ''may'' indeed be the additional results obtained as the scientific package rapidly descends once the balloon pops.\n|-\n| Meteogenesis || No || The chart purports to show the path of two weather balloons crossing and labels the space between them with a new word. The root \"meteo\" means something high up (in this case, balloons) and \"genesis\" means creation. The implication is that a new balloon was created, though no third flight path is shown so it presumably did not fly separately or was not tracked.\nIn reality, one of the tracks (almost certainly the left one) is the track of the measured dew point. Where the line of the existing conditions cross this line is where the moisture will precipitate out and form clouds, a process that might well be called \"{{wiktionary|meteor#English|meteo}}+{{wiktionary|genesis#English|genesis}}\", but {{w|Cloud physics|isn't}}.\n|-\n| Seems bad || Not a common feature || The path of the balloon loops around in the shape of a {{w|figure-eight knot}}, which would indicate very chaotic conditions at that point, if taken as positional information\nAs the actual Skew-T Log-P graph does not record positional information, this is best interpreted as having encountered a fluctuating temperature as the pressure decreases, continuing as something (possibly {{w|Wind shear#Vertical component|vertical wind shear}}, or some form of compression waves, encountering the instruments) creates a temporary increase in external pressure, and then circumstances return it to its more typical altitude-induced pressure-drop. Though this is not ''impossible'' to naturally happen, it might even be best interpreted as the instruments being deliberately 'buzzed' by a passing aircraft or rocket, including some intermittent form of thermal backwash as the interfering craft criss-crosses the balloon's physical track in a briefly complex encounter.\n<br/>Whatever happened to the temperature/pressure track, it apparently did not significantly change the associated dew-point/pressure track (if the pressure did indeed temporarily rise, the related dew points repeated themselves each time the pressure values were re-encountered).\n|-\n| Dew point || Wrongly represented || The temperature at which water condenses out of the air, and therefore dew starts to form, given the amount of water vapor in the air. It is shown here as an ''actual'' single point, when it should be a line (typically the leftmost solid plotted line) representing the temperature at which dew should form at any given pressure.\n|-\n| Humidor || No || In reality, is a {{w|Humidor|container}} that is used to maintain a more controllable humidity within which to store smoking products. In the graph, points at the line that is probably representing the dew point, which is represents the ''actual'' humidity encountered.\n|-\n| Heavyside layer || No || In the metaphysical cosmology of the musical ''Cats'', the Heavyside Layer is a blissful afterlife which all the cats in the musical long for. It is likely included here as a comical misspelling of the {{w|Kennelly-Heaviside layer|(Kennelly-)Heaviside layer}} (also called the E region) of the {{w|ionosphere}} that was co-discovered by {{w|Arthur E. Kennelly}} and {{w|Oliver Heaviside}}. This layer is extremely far up in relative atmospheric terms, straddling the {{w|KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line|boundary to 'space'}}, and would be shown as a broad horizontal feature significantly above the existing \"No birds up here\" label, if it all.\nThe labeled item, in this diagram, is a heavily marked isotherm, or line of constant temperature. Most likely this is the 0Â°C line, marking the freezing point of water that is of great importance to meteorologists, pilots, etc. With a few caveats, passing 'through' this line marks a transition between any precipitation tending to be liquid rain and of it being snow/hail-forming (or, on passing down through it, to start melting such things), and if the measurement lines ''start'' above-left of this line then any falling (or condensing) water is almost certainly going to appear as one frozen form or other. Above-ground, it suggests important implications of potential ice-formation (affecting ''weight'' and lift dynamics) upon aircraft beyond any given altitude, should the existing moisture load be high and the dew-point be inconveniently close.\n|-\n| These lines are tilted because the wind is blowing them || No || The wind is not actually a derivable feature of this diagram, which does not have data of either direction or strength of air movement. These lines are actually dry adiabats (see above) â€” possibly two sets, due to a similar renormalized interpretation, as with the isotherms, at a given reference pressure.\n|-\n| Don't stand here or you might get hit by a balloon || No || On the misguided basis that this is a cross-sectional diagram, this would be the imagined release-point for the balloon(s) involved. And, if you're particularly (un)lucky with the winds, where they eventually fall straight back down to once the balloon has popped.\nHowever, this is a diagram of some measurements ''for'' a location, not directly indicating a range of places you could choose to stand, and the bottom of the lines indicate the conditions ''at'' the release point (and possibly then the point of landing), regardless of where those lines appear to be rooted. To be accurate, the whole width of the table (and at a 'height' that represents the actual recorded ground-level pressure for that location and time) is where any 'danger' may be. The person initially releasing the balloon would not normally be too fazed by being struck by a wind-buffeted balloon (if anything, they'd be more concerned at damaging it prior to release). The attached remains of a popped balloon that is no longer buoyant will generally also act as a form of parachute (together with any actual drogue chute) to make any the light (and often well padded) payload descend slowly enough to not be a falling danger.\n<br/>Having traveled tens of kilometers up, before gently coming down, the chances of any given balloon landing in any given awkward spot (let alone the point of release) are low. Where possible, the sensor package and the remains of the balloon may be recovered, but the largest danger may instead be the environmental effects of the fragments of burst balloon, scattered to the very winds they were originally measuring.\n|-\n| Temperostrophic enthalpy<br/>(''Title text'') || No || The largely nonsensical first word perhaps could be interpreted as \"time-warping\", and allude to the varying passage of time experienced by those who do or do not understand these charts, on having to examine them.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Do NOT delete this tag too soon.}}\n\n:How to interpret a skew-T log-P diagram\n:[The comic shows a skew-T log-P diagram.
