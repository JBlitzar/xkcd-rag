This means that they are now able to socialize within society, as they are unafraid of being infected by COVID or spreading COVID to others.\n\nHowever, the punchline lies in the fact that Cueball and Megan have never been good with [[:Category:Social interactions|social interactions]], and are still unsure of how to do this.\n\nThe title text continues with this theme, as Cueball (or Megan?) is good at building mathematical models to know when it is safe to attend parties (and other large gatherings), but the issue remains that they are not commonly invited to these events, or are socially awkward when attending them.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding his phone up, looking at the bright screen (indicated with lines emanating from the screen). Megan stands next to him looking down at his phone.]\n:Cueball: It's official: We're fully vaccinated.\n:Megan: It doesn't feel real.\n\n:[Cueball has put his phone away, and they are looking at each other.]\n:Cueball: I can't wait to hang out with friends again.\n:Megan: ''Seriously.''\n\n:[In a frame-less panel they are just standing next to each other, but looking away from each other.]\n\n:[They look back at each other and continue the conversation.]\n:Cueball: So, uh...how do we...\n:Megan: I was hoping '''''you''''' knew.\n:Cueball: I'm realizing now, I was hazy on this '''''before''''' the pandemic.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:COVID-19]]\n[[Category:COVID-19 vaccine]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Social interactions]]"
