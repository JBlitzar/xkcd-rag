Instead of claiming that leprechauns and their gold don't exist, [[Cueball]] offers the refutation that, technically, {{w|File:Circular_rainbow.jpg|rainbows are circles}}, so they do not have an end. This is true for an idealized rainbow, and for some actual rainbows: if the viewer has an unobstructed view of the light-reflecting substance creating the effect for the whole of the circle's circumference, they could see a full circle. In practice, the circle is often broken by the horizon or, for example, discontinuity in cloud cover.\n\nHowever, Megan counters that if one considers the path that light takes to form a rainbow, then it forms a two-cone structure, where the Sun (the vertex of the outer cone) emits light rays that move towards the Earth (forming the faces of the outer cone), then reflect off water droplets located at just the right angle (the circular base) to reach our eyes (the vertex of the inner cone). Thus, such a rainbow structure ''can'' be said to have \"ends\", represented by the vertices of the two cones: one at the eye of the viewer, and another at the light source (usually the sun).\nA common rainbow (for which the base is formed by a water droplets in the Earth's atmosphere) can not be viewed as that. The Sun's diameter is orders of magnitude greater than Earth's one (even including the outer layers of the atmosphere), and we would expect the apex of a cone to be much smaller than its base. Thus a two-cone rainbow which ostensibly starts in Sun shall have its effective base formed in the outer space. Or, rather, be a smudged out sum of all point origins lying within the near-hemisoheric visible glowing atmosphere of the Sun, refracted by whatever solar atmosphere they each immediately have to pass through in order to arrive at the droplets, and thence back towards our eyes.\n\nMegan then says that the Sun is indeed a pot of gold. The Sun is approximately [https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html 1.989 × 10<sup>30</sup> (1 nonillion 989 octillion) kilograms], and its abundance of gold is approximately [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1968PASAu...1..133A&data_type=PDF_HIGH&filetype=.pdf&type=PRINTER&whole_paper=YES 0.3 parts per trillion] (ed: this value is incorrect - values in the paper are not in ppt - see comments below). Based on these numbers, the sun contains 5.967 × 10<sup>17</sup> (596 quadrillion 700 trillion) kilograms of gold. This equates to 5.967 × 10<sup>14</sup> (596 trillion 700 billion) metric tons of gold. As such, Megan's statement that the sun contains \"quintillions of tons of gold\" is off by a factor of roughly 4000, but the amount of gold within the sun is, nonetheless, far more than a pot's worth.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe amount of water in the oceans is about [https://phys.org/news/2014-12-percent-earth.html 1.35 × 10<sup>18</sup> (1 quintillion 350 quadrillion) metric tons]. If we assume that Megan is still talking in terms of mass rather than volume or molecule count, then her next statement (that there is more gold in the sun than water in the oceans) would have been true had she been correct in her previous claim, but in fact there is more sea-water than sun-gold by a factor of roughly 2300.\n\nCueball then asks about leprechauns (perhaps ironically, since Megan's theory at this point appears to involve astronomy/physics, not mythical creatures/beings). Megan replies that the leprechauns all died when the Sun formed, building on the irony of Cueball's question (and opening questions about the role of leprechauns in the early formation of our solar system).\n\nThe title text suggests that, since the pot of gold exists as an idea in the brains of people thinking about it, and the retina is the foremost part of the brain for light perception, it can be argued that, in addition to existing in the sun as the comic explains, the gold (and leprechauns) also exist at the perceiver's end of the cone, as long as they are thinking about a pot of gold at the time (and then it's gone as soon as they stop thinking about it). Many neurologists would agree with the concept that ideas in your mind can be said to be physically located in your brain. However, this seems to go further, and suggest an {{w|Idealism|idealist}} ontological position, that things, in this case a pot of gold, exist by virtue of our having an idea of them.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Megan and Cueball are walking.]\n:Megan: There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n:Cueball: Rainbows are circles. They have no end.\n:Megan: Not quite!\n\n:[In a borderless panel, a multi-part graphic is shown depicting what Megan is describing off-panel: a short cone inside a longer cone, with the longer cone having its point starting at the Sun, the shorter cone having its point at a miniature Cueball's head, and both cones sharing the same circular base. The diagram is repeated from 3 different perspectives to make the structure easier to grasp.]\n:Megan (off-panel): A '''rainbow''' is light leaving the Sun, bouncing off the clouds, and converging on your eye. It's an inside-out two-ended cone.\n\n:[Megan and Cueball are still walking.]\n:Megan: One end of that cone is your retina.\n\n:[A wider view of the same scene, with Megan and Cueball walking on a dark ground.]\n:Megan: The other end is the Sun—which contains quintillions of tons of gold. There's more gold in the Sun than water in the oceans.\n:Cueball: So there ''is'' a pot of gold!\n:Cueball: What about leprechauns?\n:Megan: All incinerated as the sun formed. Very sad.\n\n==Trivia==\n\nAs of January 19, 2017, the value of gold is 42,692.98 USD per kilogram. Based on this, all of the gold in the sun is worth 2.5474901 × 10^22 (25 sextillion 474 quintillion 901 quadrillion) USD. Of course, if you tried to sell the gold in the sun, the market would be saturated and the value of gold would plummet astronomically. You would never be able to cash out.\n\nThe idea that the Sun is valuable in monetary terms is also present in [[1622: Henge]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics_featuring_Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics_featuring_Cueball]]"
