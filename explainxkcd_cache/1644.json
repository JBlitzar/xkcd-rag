I think that's a great question and you should totally ask it. On the infinite tree of possible conversations spread out before us, I think that's definitely the most promising branch.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThis is the first comic in the [[:Category:Stargazing|Stargazing]] series. It was followed by [[2017: Stargazing 2]] two and a half years later.\n\nThis comic opens on [[Megan]] as the host for a {{w|stargazing}} TV show, or simply a stargazing tour. She claims to be a doctor, although it is unclear what exactly she's a doctor of. Her remarks, however, may call her professionalism into question. (Originally the host was suspected to be a spoof on {{w|Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox}}, see [[#Relevant TV-shows|below]], but at some later point [[Randall]] changed his official transcript thus making the host female rather than male as in the original version, see the [[#Trivia|trivia]] section below. Thus now the host is clearly Megan, which it could not have been originally when the host was described as a man by Randall).\n\nThroughout the comic the host's tone and choice of words becomes increasingly unprofessional, referring to most of the stars as \"shitty,\" personifying them based on different astronomical observations, and providing little useful information on the study of stars or how they work. It seems that this is not an isolated issue as the host mentions that people keep asking her whether or not she is a real astronomer. The host also continuously glosses over the arguably less exciting portions of a typical presentation on astronomy sharing only what she sees as \"the good stuff.\" This penchant for only caring about something if it is interesting extends past astronomy as well as the host is too bored when reading the dictionary to look up the meaning of astronomer.\n\nThe comic derives much of its humor from the absurdity of the host's comments on various astronomical bodies. Although not technically incorrect, the way she presents the information is far from informative. (See details below on [[#The host's observations|the host's observations]]). One of her observations regards the fact that {{w|Sirius}} is a {{w|binary star}}, a system where two stars orbit each other. So even though it is the brightest star as seen from Earth we only really see one of them, as the other is, to quote the host, \"not even trying\". Sirius A is \"large\" and \"bright\" {{w|main sequence}} white star, while Sirius B is a {{w|white dwarf}} with a little under half the mass, 0.49% the radius and only 0.22% the luminosity of Sirius A.\n\n{{w|Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda}} is the largest galaxy in our {{w|Local Group}}. It is 220,000 light years across and contains a trillion stars. Humans have difficulty conceptualizing distances of this scale. Suffice to say that it is very large.{{Citation needed}} {{w|Betelgeuse}} is the 9th brightest star visible from earth. One of its prominent features is its visible redness. Within the next million years (or maybe only 100,000 years) it is expected to explode as a {{w|supernova}}, which will certainly be a spectacular sight. It could happen anytime now, and the host hopes it will be in her lifetime. See also [[1371: Brightness]] and [[1342: Ancient Stars]]. Saying cool things about space to make people like you is mentioned in [[1746: Making Friends]].\n\nIn the title text it is mentioned that the {{w|Sun}} is also a star and of course is much brighter than Sirius seen from Earth, and thus Sirius is technically not the brightest star in our sky (although it is in the night sky). The title text sarcastically encourages the audience to raise that obvious but irrelevant point (a standard joke when people mention bright stars) instead of asking a more interesting, informative, or fruitful question, when there are so many to ask regarding astronomy.\n\n===The host's observations===\nHere is a list of the host's observations:\n\n;Most {{w|Bright Star Catalogue|visible stars}} are still very faint, and just become background to the bright {{w|stars}} that form the named {{w|constellations}}.\n:The host correctly states that they are just dots. (This is also true for the bright stars, but at least they are clearly distinguishable).\n\n;{{w|Sirius}} is the {{w|Apparent magnitude|brightest}} star in our {{w|List of brightest stars|night sky}}, which of course also excludes the Sun itself. But it is not the brightest object in the night sky, as several of the planets, especially {{w|Venus}} and {{w|Jupiter}}, and of course the {{w|Moon}} are much brighter. It is also far from being one of the most {{w|Absolute magnitude|luminous stars}} in the {{w|Milky Way}}, but its proximity to Earth makes it the brightest in the night sky. For instance, {{w|Betelgeuse}}, mentioned later in the comic, is thousands of times more luminous than Sirius, but it is so farther away that it appears dimmer.\n:The host thus names Sirius as the star in charge since it outshines all the others as seen from the {{w|Earth}}.\n\n;Sirius is actually a star system consisting of two stars: a {{w|binary star}} system. But though Sirius A is twice the size of the {{w|Sun}} and much brighter, Sirius B is currently just a dim {{w|white dwarf}}, the remains of a much larger star that became a {{w|red giant}} before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state around 120 million years ago. So now Sirius A completely outshines Sirius B, which actually is now a dead star with no further fusion inside its core.\n:This is construed by the host as it is barely even trying, as it is now only radiating away the rest of the heat from the now-exposed core.\n\n;{{w|Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda}} is a {{w|spiral galaxy}}, like the Milky Way, and it is the largest galaxy in the {{w|Local Group}} where our own galaxy the Milky Way is the second largest. It is one of a few visible objects that are located outside the Milky Way. It is \"only\" 2.5 million light-years from the Sun and it is heading our way (or vice versa), and will {{w|Andromedaâ€“Milky Way collision|collide with the Milky way}} in about 4 billion years (before the Sun goes into {{w|Sun#After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion|its red giant phase}}). Being 220,000 light years across and consisting of a trillion stars, it is somewhere between 1.2-2.2 times wider than the Milky Way and has 2.5-10 times as many stars. (The local group was also mentioned two comics ago, in [[1642: Gravitational Waves]], together with the much less well known third largest galaxy in the group the {{w|Triangulum Galaxy}}).\n:It is therefore true when the host says that it is too big to try to understand, and thinking about it will make your head spin, so she suggests we do not think about it.\n\n;{{w|Betelgeuse}} is a clearly visible (9th brightest) {{w|Red_supergiant|red supergiant}} {{w|Semiregular_variable_star|variable star}} located in the {{w|Orion (constellation)|constellation of Orion}}. It is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars (12th) and one of the few where it is clear that the light is not white. Most people can see that it is slightly red, whereas most other stars are so faint that they look white despite having different colors (when seeing Orion's two brightest stars, to remember which is which between Rigel and Betelgeuse, its diagonal opposite, just remember: Rigel is \"R\" like blue, and Betelgeuse is \"B\" like red). It is expected that Betelgeuse, being at a late stage of its {{w|Stellar_evolution|evolution}}, will go supernova within the next 100,000 years as a {{w|type II supernova}}. The exact time when it will become a {{w|Supernova}} is so uncertain that it could [http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/betelgeuse-will-explode-someday#explode just as likely happen tomorrow] as in a 100,000 years. When it happens it will not be dangerous to anyone on Earth, but it will likely be visible even during the day, as it may even become as bright as the full Moon.\n:When it does go nova, it will be a fantastic spectacle for everyone, but especially for anyone who likes the ''good stuff'' in space like the host, who cannot wait for the star to explode. Clearly she hopes it will be in her lifetime, and, although this is unlikely, there is a small chance that it might just happen.\n\n;A {{w|meteor}} (also known as {{w|shooting star}}), is debris from space that rains down on Earth, and burns up in the atmosphere. This happens all the time, but you need to be either lucky, patient, or know the right time for one of the {{w|meteor showers}} to see one. Often they are visible for so short a time period, that it is difficult to share the experience with anyone, as it will be gone by the time they turn their head to look where you are pointing.\n:The host becomes very excited when she spots such a meteor, especially because it is likely that her audience got to share the experience with her, as they were already looking in the same direction as her. But still she asks if they saw it, because it is so short lived.\n\n;{{w|Outer space}} is the void that exists between {{w|Astronomical object|celestial bodies}}, including the Earth. There is by definition nothing there but {{w|vacuum}}, and the interesting part of space is thus not the space but the astronomical objects found out there.\n:The host says that ''space is awesome'', which is a very un-astronomical comment, as explained above. Also her excitement for a simple shooting star is cause for the suspicion that is raised after her space comment.\n\n;A {{w|dictionary}} is a reference resource for words. Unless otherwise specified (as a \"Dictionary of ''<some theme>''\"), it contains a significant proportion of ''all'' words in the language(s) it covers.\n:The host considers the dictionary ''boring'', which suggests that she is not even familiar with how to zero in on a word and its definition. For a typical and expected English dictionary (unless she made further errors) the word \"Astronomer\" is actually quite near the start, but it still would have been a large number of words needing to be read past (e.g. \"a ... aardvark ... abandon ... abbey ... abbreviation ... ability ...\") if one tried to find the word by slavishly checking every entry on the way up to it. It adds to the suspicion that the host's actual expertise isn't in either space ''or'' any more normal and grounded matters but {{tvtropes|Cloudcuckoolander|somewhere else entirely}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A thin panel with Megan as a TV-host is holding her hands up. She is drawn in white on a black background. Behind her is an audience drawn in faint gray lines consisting of Hairy (to the left) and two Cueball-like guys and Ponytail (seen in a rare full face position) to the right of the host. One of the Cueball-like guys is partly hidden behind the host.]\n:Host: Welcome to stargazing, with your host, me.\n:Host: I'm a doctor or whatever.\n\n:[Same scene as before but in a broader panel, and the host is now holding only one hand up with a finger pointing up. The audience is the same four people, but now Hairy has moved further to the left in the panel to make room for a Megan-like woman also to the left of the host.]\n:Host: I'm not gonna waste your time on the shitty stars.\n:Host: Just the good stuff.\n:Host: Honestly half of 'em just look like dots.\n\n:[A frame-less drawing with a zoom out showing the group of six people in black silhouette on a white background. Part of the ground beneath them is shown as a black pool. The host is pointing up with one hand. The people have been rearranged, so left of the host is now a Cueball-like guy and a Megan-like woman, and to the right is the other Cueball-like guy, then Ponytail (seen from the side as usual) and Hairy. All are looking up following the host's directions.]\n:Host: This is Sirius. It's the brightest star in our sky so it's in charge.\n:Host: It's really two stars but one of them is barely even trying.\n:Host: This is Andromeda, it's too big to think about, so let's not.\n\n:[Zoom in of the host's upper body, again drawn in white on a black background. She is looking right gesturing with one arm raised, and the other still pointing up with a finger stretched out. Her audience is no longer shown.]\n:Host: That red stars is Betelgeuse. It's gonna explode someday.\n:Host: Can't happen soon enough, as far as I'm concerned. I-\n:Host: ''Holy shit did you see that meteor!?!''\n:Host: Space is ''awesome!''\n\n:[Same scene as the previous panel, but the host has turned towards left looking at someone in the audience (not shown) who speaks off-screen. She has taken both her hands down for the first time.]\n:Off-screen voice: Are you ''sure'' you're an astronomer?\n:Host: People keep asking that, so I finally tried to look that word up in a dictionary, and ''wow'' is that book ever boring. No thank you.\n:Off-screen voice: But-\n:Host: ''Space!''\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/4/48/20160221022727!stargazing.png original version of the comic], the third panel said \"'''That's''' Andromeda\" instead of \"'''This is''' Andromeda\".\n\n*In [https://web.archive.org/web/20160913162302/http://xkcd.com/1646/info.0.json the original version of the official transcript], the TV host was referred to using he/him pronouns. [http://xkcd.com/1646/info.0.json The transcript was later updated] to use she/her pronouns for the host.\n\n*The transcripts [[Transcript|have been messed up]] for comics uploaded around this time, with some descriptions in official transcripts being mismatched with other comics uploaded around this time. This issue can still be seen [http://xkcd.com/1646/info.0.json here], as it [[Transcript|has not been fixed to this day]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Stargazing]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|Stargazing]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
