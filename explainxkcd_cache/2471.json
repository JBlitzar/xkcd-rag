Unrelatedly, did you know there are 850 trillion waves in the ocean?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThe first part of this comic deals with unreliable sources on the internet. Neither \"viral posts\" nor \"random [[wikipedia:Listicle|listicles]]\" are usually very reliable sources of information. They rarely cite their sources,{{Citation needed}} and they are often published without much fact-checking, as published volume and impressive-sounding numbers are far more important for ad-revenue than actual facts.\n\nThe viral post appears to be [https://www.facebook.com/clickhole/photos/a.1461385317435063/2945077732399140/?type=3 this Facebook post.] The relevant source is unknown (and may very well be made up, since the source is {{w|ClickHole}}, a satirical website formerly owned by {{w|The Onion}}). There are a number of listicles Cueball may be referring to, but they all appear to be citing [https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation], however, even they do not seem to provide source for the number of fatalities caused by hippopotamus.\n\nThe quip turns on a pun between \"hippo\" and \"HIPAA\". The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ({{w|HIPAA}}, pronounced ''HIP-uh'') is an American healthcare law enacted in 1996. One of the most commonly cited provisions from HIPAA is the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information.\n\nIn this comic, Cueball and Megan are discussing the number of {{w|hippopotamus}} attacks, which is unverified. Megan proposes an alternative explanation as to why this particular number is hard to come by: it would be violating the patients' privacy to create statistics of a very specific and unusual cause of death. The punchline comes with the pun on \"hippo violation\" (\"HIPAA violation\").\n\nThe title text amplifies the criticism of listicles. They sometimes provide factoids with regards to ill-defined, hard-to-measure numbers, and these factoids might end up in common circulation between such articles. One extreme example would be the number of waves in the ocean. Some problems with this definition would be:\n\n* In which ocean/oceans?\n* What is the smallest ripple that counts as a wave?\n* When does one count two interacting waves as separate, and when does one count them as one?\n* Are counted waves limited to water waves, or can EM waves be considered?\n* Should sub-surface waves be evaluated, too?\n* How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky?\n\nWith different replies to these questions, wildly different answers could be reached. But, counting every body of water on the planet, 850 trillion waves works out as around 2.354 (unique) waves per square meter.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at his desk. He has lifted both arms with palm up towards the screen of his laptop in front of him. Megan stands behind him to the right, looking over his shoulder at the screen.]\n:Cueball: I hate unsourced statistics.\n:Cueball: ''This'' viral post says hippos kill 2,900 people a year, but ''this'' random listicle says 500.\n:Megan: Makes sense.\n:Megan: Publishing the real number would be a HIPPO violation.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
