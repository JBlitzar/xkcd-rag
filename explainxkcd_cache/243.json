They are usually colored red, as in the comic.  Other manufacturers have alternative names for their implementations, and typically use diferent colors. It is obviously the most formal of the four names. The more informal two are nub and nipple mouse (referencing breasts), with the last, most informal being clit mouse, a reference to clitoris (part of the female genitalia).\n\nThe title text notes that [[Randall]] prefers pointing sticks to touchpads.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A diagram of a TrackPoint pointer on a keyboard, under which is a continuous line labeled \"Tone of Conversation-Formal to Informal.\" There are four boxes under this line.]\n:How to refer to the pointer thing on laptop keyboards:\n:Very formal: TrackPointâ„¢-style pointer\n:Formal: Nub\n:Informal: Nipple mouse\n:Very informal: Clit mouse\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
