I wanted to include the pitch drop experiment, but it turns out the gif format has some issues with decade-long loops.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic shows a number of common events, arranged in a grid. Each of the events flashes with its average frequency. For example, statistically a child is born somewhere on the world approximately every 0.24 seconds, or four times per second. Therefore, the tile \"One birth\" blinks about 4 times per second. A thorough analysis of the frequencies present in this comic and how they relate to the underlying technology (the GIF format) was published as [http://notebooks.jsvine.com/reverse-engineering-xkcd-frequency/ Reverse Engineering xkcd's 'Frequency'].\n\nThe table below lists all the events and their periods/frequencies (computed from the GIF loop times). Some events make reference to other comics.\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Pitch drop experiment}} which measures the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. At room temperature, tar pitch flows at a very slow rate, taking several years to form a single drop. The title text jokes that Randall tried to include a tile that flashes about once every {{w|decade|ten years}}, but the tiles are all {{w|Animated GIF|animated GIFs}} and while the file format supports animations of any length, the resulting file would be too big (at least 10 megabytes).\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Picture\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Text\n!Period (seconds)\n!Frequency (per minute)\n!Frequency (per year)\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Explanation and/or references to other comics.\n|-\n|[[File:heartbeat.gif]]\n|Heartbeat||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.86||style=\"text-align:right;\"|70||style=\"text-align:right;\"|33,000,000||The typical resting {{w|heart rate}} in adults is 60–80 beats per minute (bpm).\n|-\n|[[File:birth.gif]]\n|One birth||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.24||style=\"text-align:right;\"|250||style=\"text-align:right;\"|131,490,000||The {{w|Birth rate|birth rate}} that occurs on Earth.\n|-\n|[[File:death.gif]]\n|One death||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.56||style=\"text-align:right;\"|107||style=\"text-align:right;\"|56,360,000||The {{w|Mortality rate|Mortality rate}} is much lower than the birth rate shown above; thus, the world's population continues to increase.
