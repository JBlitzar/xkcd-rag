There are only three words in the English language. What is the third word? Hint: The word is something that everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.''\nPhrased this way, the intended answer is \"language\" because \"There are only three words in (the phrase)'' 'the English language' ''.\" \"Think of words ending in '-gry' ...\" is used as misdirection.\n\nCueball tells this joke. (The comic unintentionally misphrases the original riddle; see below.) When [[Cueball]] attempts to say the answer is \"language\" and act smugly about it, [[Black Hat]] is unimpressed and cuts off Cueball's forearm, explaining that communicating badly is not the same as cleverness. Black Hat's point is that the riddle's \"cleverness\" depends on misleadingly implying that \"three words\" refers to words ending in \"-gry,\" rather than the phrase \"the English language.\" Black Hat does not seem to agree that this riddle is clever.\n\nWhile answering reader questions at an event ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f95uxPO4Vk4 Youtube video]), Randall clarified that his point about bad communication applies to the riddle in general. However, a secondary interpretation, which people spotted and wrote to Randall about, is that Cueball failed to tell the joke correctly and Black Hat is angry that Cueball botched the joke. As above, the joke is supposed to go, \"There are only three words in 'the English language,'\" while only implying that you meant \"words that end in '-gry.'\" However, Cueball instead states, \"There are three words in the English language that end in '-gry,'\" and by doing so has ruined any chance of Black Hat determining the correct answer; now, \"three words\" can't refer to the correct answer \"the English language\" because Cueball has accidentally used a longer phrase instead. Thus, Cueball has communicated badly both intentionally and unintentionally.\n\nIn any case, no matter how annoying Cueball's smugness, Black Hat responding by cutting off Cueball's forearm is an overreaction {{Citation needed}} (while his calm demeanor in doing so is an underreaction to the overreaction). Additionally, his calmly-made point about the riddle is likely not to be understood by Cueball, who can only focus on his debilitating injury. Black Hat has, ironically, failed to communicate his point about proper communication, although given Black Hat's personality he likely doesn't care, and may even have intended the irony.\n\nAs Black Hat mentioned in the comic, if you count obscure and archaic words, there are additional English words that end with \"-gry.\" Some are listed [http://www.snopes.com/language/puzzlers/gry.asp here]. The word \"{{wiktionary|hangry}}\", a new solution, was only added to Webster's and the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42870791 OED] dictionary in 2018, long after the riddle was invented, although its use was established to go [https://www.oed.com/dictionary/hangry_adj as far back as 1918].\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|postmodernism}}, a philosophy and corresponding art movement. Postmodern music is often {{w|minimalist}}, as exemplified by the weird sounds of {{w|Philip Glass}} and {{w|Steve Reich}}, and {{w|Postmodern art#Movements in postmodern art|postmodern visual art}} saw trends such as lowbrow and installation art gain attention. Apart from a rejection of modernism, however, it is difficult to outline postmodernism to justify the strange works of art. {{w|Deconstruction}} is another important concept, but it is difficult to describe the process. In short, postmodernists make art that no one understands and may act smugly about it, but they do not adequately explain what their art means, or it doesn't really mean anything. In other words, there is nothing to understand. Thus, Black Hat's statement, ''that such practice is not \"cleverness,\"'' applies to them as well.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Cueball are standing next to each other.]\n:Cueball: There are three words in the English language that end in \"gry\". \"Angry\" and \"Hungry\" are two. What's the third?\n\n:Black Hat: I don't think there is one, unless you count really obscure words.\n:Cueball: Ha! It's \"language\"! I said there are three words in \"the English--\" Hey!\n:''GRAB''\n:[Black Hat grabs Cueball's hand, with a knife in hand.]\n\n:Cueball: What th--AAAAAAAAAA\n:''SLICE''\n:[Black Hat slices off Cueball's hand with the knife.]\n\n:[Cueball is bleeding profusely.]\n:Black Hat: Ok, listen carefully.\n:Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n:Black Hat: Communicating badly and then acting smug when you're misunderstood is not cleverness.\n:Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n:Black Hat: I hope we've learned something today.\n:Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n==Trivia==\nAround the time this comic was posted, Randall also posted [[Blue Eyes]]: The Hardest Logic Puzzle in the World. He apparently took his own advice to heart as he explicitly states he has gone over the wording of the puzzle several times before publishing it to make it as unambiguous as possible. \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Comics with blood]]"
