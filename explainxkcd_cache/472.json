Danielewski's novel ''{{w|House of Leaves}}'' by renaming it ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Pancakes'' (after the American fast food franchise {{w|International House of Pancakes}}). ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'' has an unconventional page layout and style, including the colouring of every instance of the word \"<span style=\"color:blue\">house</span>\" in blue, as is done on the menu. It includes footnotes within footnotes like Randall did here.\n\nIn ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'', protagonist Johnny Truant (whose meta-narration is marked by Courier font as mimicked in the comic) discovers a book called ''The Navidson Record'' (represented here by the pancake menu), which in turn details a film of the same name, which in turn details a horror story of a family living in a sentient <span style=\"color:blue\">house</span>. Truant, who is clearly intelligent and cultured, probes deeper into notating ''The Navidson Record''—and into insomnia—until ''The Navidson Record'' consumes his mind horrifically, the same way the film in the novel consumed the author of ''The Navidson Record'', the same way the <span style=\"color:blue\">house</span> in the novel consumed part of the family.\n\n''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'' lends itself to many interpretations, but has been called a \"satire of academic criticism,\" which makes this comic essentially a satire of a satire. Since part of the appeal of ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'' is that it takes itself extremely seriously with its intricacy, multitude of both real and made-up references to academic and popular culture, and layered emotional conflict, Randall's reduction of the ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'' to the (International) <span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Pancakes cuts a humorous edge to a dark story. The tone of the comic parodies the tone of ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'': lonely, fear-inducing, and increasingly insane, but using pancakes instead of darkness.\n\nAdditionally, the mysterious \"Mohawk Girl\" referred to in the comic may be a nod to the ''<span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves'' character Delial, or to [[147: A Way So Familiar]].\n\nThe word \"<span style=\"color:blue\">house</span>\" is in blue in every instance, which is a stylistic attribute of Mark Z. Danielewski's novel. Every Minotaur reference is marked out in red ink, and every use of \"<span style=\"color:blue\">house</span>\" or a foreign language's equivalent, such as '<span style=\"color:blue\">Haus</span>' and '<span style=\"color:blue\">maison</span>' is in blue. This is not a reference to hyperlinks. It is often thought that the <span style=\"color:blue\">house</span> is printed in blue because <span style=\"color:blue\">houses</span> have 'blueprints.'\n\nThe censored portion of the Big Steak Omelette is \"...fresh green peppers, onions, mushrooms,...\" per IHOP's website for the Big Steak Omelette: \"Tender and tasty strips of steak, hash browns, fresh green peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and Cheddar cheese.\"  Also, Omelette is misspelled, but that's probably just a typo.\n\nThe title text refers to the {{w|Waffle House}}, another US restaurant chain. The joke is that the protagonist has decided that maybe all this angst isn't worth it, and he'll just go to a different restaurant.\n\nClicking on the original comic links to the amazon.com page for <span style=\"color:blue\">House</span> of Leaves.\n\nFrom ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'':\n{{quote|This is a parody of the fascinating book ''House of Leaves''.}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[All instances of the word \"House\" are in blue. Text is a mix of 'Printed' (hi-res serifed proportional font), 'Typed' (more crude-looking non-proportional serifed font) and 'Written' (freetext, in standard xkcd AllCaps style, having the occasional decoration and emphasis added).]\n:[Above the 'frame' is Typed text:] Every day a new city, a new IHOP. And yet every night the dreams get worse. I ply the highways, a nervous eye on the rear-view mirror, the back seat piled with stolen menus. Their doors are opened 24 hours, but forever closed to my soul. This is what my life has become. This is my hell.\n:[A bordered frame, in the style of an (illustrated and annotated) menu. We see two columns of product descriptions, three full ones and in each column and a hint of a fourth going beyond the bottom of the frame.]\n:[Each clear description generally start with a product name, in bold, and a product description, all in Printed text. To the left of these are an illustrative image which has a barely legible caption seemingly identical to the product namr header, and a stylistic 'angled shadow' set subtly behind it. In each description text there may be at least one footnote-number in superscript and square-brackets. Below each are Typed footnote paragraphs (mostly) relating to the footnote numbers in the above description. Additional scribbles are Written around and alongside the above, as text, doodles and other marks of one type or another.]\n:[Menu header:]\n::[Sidenote left, Written:] International\n::[Printed header:] House of Pancakes\n::[Scribbled-out sidenote, Written to the right:] BLOGSPOT\n\n:[Item subheader, top of first column:] Strawberry Banana Pancakes\n::[Item description:] Four pancakes filled with sliced fresh banana and crowned with cool strawberry topping, more [17] bananas and [23] whipped topping.\n::[Footnote 17, with three smudged fingerprints over parts of this and the top of the next item down (a fourth, perhaps, far to the bottom of the framed area):] Driven by a nameless fear, a whisper in the dark behind me, I flee ahead of I know not what. Whenver I turn, there's nobody behind me. And yet someone is clearly stealing the ketchup. WHY?\n::[Footnote 23, sandwiched incongruously and sideways from low to high, mostly between the images of the Stuffed French Toast and Ham and Egg Melt items, to the right:] My life is feeding, fleeing, fighting, and forgetting.\n\n:[Item subheader, second down on left column:] Rooty Jr.\n::[Item description, a splash of red (ketchup/blood) within it, further (secondary?) spatters and red marks, possibly including an attempt to create mostly unintelligable letters, spread on or around lower passages:] A kids only [19] version of our house signature Rooty Tooty. One scrambled egg, one strip of bacon, one pork sausage link and one fruit-topped buttermilk pancake.\n::[Footnote 19:] The decision not to hyphenate \"kids only\" is likely connected to the omission of the serial comma. I wonder if the author is British. I wonder if he sleeps at night.\n\n:[Item subheader, third down on left:] Rise 'N Shine\n::[Item description:] Two eggs, toast and hash browns served with your choice [21] of two strips of bacon or two pork sausage links.\n::[Footnote 21, starting with an small word (possibly (I\") made illegible by one of the spatters of red:] rent a storage unit. Sleep there. Fill it with pancakes. Leave.\n\n:[Item subheader, top of right column:] Stuffed French Toast\n::[Item description:] Cinnamon raisin French [18] toast stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling, topped with cool strawberry or your choice of fruit compote and whipped topping.\n::[Footnote 18:] Nightmares again. I wake up covered in sweat, and what appears to be a thin sheen of maple syrup\n\n:[Inserted text, Written with emphasis and underlined:] WHO IS MOHAWK GIRL? \n\n:[Item header, second down at right, which is sideways (low to high) in the general position that the horizontal text would normally be, next to the normally-set product image:] Ham & Egg Melt\n::[Item description, also sideways and consistently 'below' (to the right of) its header:] Grilled sourdough bread stuffed with ham, scrambled eggs, Swiss and American cheeses. [20]\n::[Footnote 20, normally orientated and positioned:] Ordered this in at an IHOP in Rochester, New York. There was blood on the floor. Some of it was mine.\n\n:[Small drawn doodle, inserted, of three instances of a Cueball, the middle one holding out an item (gun?) to the right, followed by a ground feature (pool of liquid?)]\n::[Written above the second (and third) Cueball:] Enough with your pancakes.\n::[Written above the 'pool', two words heavily bolded:] Enough with your GOD DAMN pancakes.\n\n:[Item header, third on the right:] The Big Steak Omlette\n::[Item description, a few words of text has been censored by a black strip:] Tender strips of steak, hash browns, [censorship strip, long enough to obscure perhaps 4-6 typical words] tomatoes and Cheddar cheese. Served [22] with house salsa.\n::[Footnote 22:] Woke up in Las Vegas. They're closing the Star Trek Experience today. The IHOP up the strip had pancake platters named after various states. None of them sounded like home.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Star Trek]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Comics with blood]]\n[[Category:Footnotes]]"
