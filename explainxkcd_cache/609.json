A common joke with the site ([[214|and Wikipedia]]) is how you will read a page, find a certain trope, which will lead to you opening another tab on your web page in order to read after you're done with the original one. Then, as you read further down this article, and others, you'll open even more pages. Pretty soon, this will cause an extremely long cycle of opening new pages and closing old ones, not necessarily at the same rate. In the comic, this is exactly what happens to [[Cueball]]. He starts on a single page, then opens more and more tabs on different pages. Pretty soon, he finds himself stuck in a loop of opening pages. The last frame refers to {{w|Rickrolling}}, which is the practice of being linked to {{w|Rick Astley|Rick Astley's}} \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ| Never Gonna Give You Up]\" on YouTube.\n\nThe title text refers to the comedy site [http://www.cracked.com Cracked.com]. This site is also known for its addictive articles. Most articles are formatted in the same way the title text notes. Eventually, Cracked itself wrote a column that [http://www.cracked.com/blog/clippy-finally-messes-with-the-wrong-word-doc/ paid tribute to this cartoon]. (See the very last line ''With that in mind, we present to you the 17 Worst Haircuts in The Ottoman Empire''.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting at a desk, looking at a computer.]\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Cueball: Huh.\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball stares at the computer.]\n:Cueball: I never noticed that!\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Cueball: Haha, yeah.\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Cueball: So true.\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball stares at the computer.]\n\n:[Cueball stares at the computer.]\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball stares at the computer.]\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Computer mouse: ''Click''\n\n:[Cueball is looking at the computer.]\n:Megan (off-screen): Are you in there?\n:Cueball: Help!\n\n:[Megan walks in behind Cueball who is still sitting at the computer. The bottom of the image is covered in Megan's last line]\n:Megan: Okay, who linked you to TVTropes? What's ''with'' that site?\n:Cueball: Can't ... stop...\n:Megan: It's like Rickrolling, but you're trapped all day.\n\n==Trivia==\nSince the comic image links to TVtropes' page for {{tvtropes|UniversalTropes|Universal tropes}}, TVtropes has prepared a welcome letter for xkcd reader at the end of the article: {{Quote}}Oh, and {{xkcd|609|hello}} to all you {{tvtropes|Webcomic/xkcd|xkcd}} readers. (And [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=609 thank you] {{tvtropes|TVTropesWillRuinYourLife|for the information}}!)}}\nHere the \"thank you\" link actually links to this page, the \"hello\" links to the comic on xkcd and the other two links are to two articles on TVTropes, the first on xkcd and the last one being an in-joke about how \"TVTropes will ruin your life\". The addition of this many links is meant to be ironic.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Rickrolling]]"
