Despite how advanced technology is, humans still have not been able to create a machine that replicates itself, an accomplishment to which only biological organisms can lay a claim. Judging by Megan's body language, she probably didn't consent to this inspection of her abdomen, and could even be a random woman that Cueball doesn't know personally or only just met.\n\nThe title text refers to a {{w|Self-replicating_machine|Von Neumann machine}}, what is usually called \"Von Neumann probe\" or \"Self replicating machine,\" a machine that would be capable of building a fully functional copy of itself. It just takes sex involving two individuals of a different sex to start the human replication factory.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is inspecting Megan's abdomen.]\n:Cueball: It's neat how you contain a factory for making more of you.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
