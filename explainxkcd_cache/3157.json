Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThis comic about {{w|extrapolation}} tracks the age of the {{w|Star Wars}} character {{w|Palpatine}} against the age of the actor who played him.\n\nThe primary film series of the Star Wars franchise consists of three trilogies: the original trilogy (1977-1983), the prequel trilogy (1999-2005), and the sequel trilogy (2015-2019). Palpatine is played by {{w|Ian McDiarmid}} in at least one film from each trilogy (and all three films of the prequel trilogy).\n\nThe character of Emperor Palpatine was briefly mentioned in the first {{w|Star Wars}} movie and appears briefly in {{w|The Empire Strikes Back}}, but doesn't have significant screen time until {{w|Return of the Jedi}} in 1983, which is when McDiarmid took on the role. He was presented as an elderly, withered, and physically decaying man, despite being played by an actor in his 30s. The character is killed near the end of the film.\n\nThe prequels portray Palpatine's rise from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor. He was 55 when the first of the prequels was made, and used no obvious aging (or de-aging) makeup or other effects, implying that the Palpatine of this era was approximately the same age as the actor (which fits nicely with the timeline of the universe).\n\n{{w|The Rise of Skywalker}} was the third film of the sequel trilogy. Infamously, this film reveals that \"somehow, Palpatine returned\". This is somewhat vaguely explained by references to \"dark signs, cloning, secrets only the Sith knew\". McDiarmid, now in his 70's, played the role once again. While he appears at least as aged as the actor (and far more physically corrupted) the joke is that, if he was cloned, his new body had an \"undefined age\", but was was presumably younger than Palpatine had been in previous appearances. \n\nThe title text suggests that the makers of Star Wars had planned this out from the beginning, and so deliberately chose a 37-year-old actor to play an elderly character, specifically so that he could continue to play the part throughout the entire film series. In fact, the long-term direction of the films were never well-planned, and the notion that the films would be made over the course of more than 4 decades was probably not ever predicted. The idea that casting was made on that assumption is unlikely in the extreme. The fact that the same actor was able to reprise his role over such a long period of time was almost certainly just a matter of luck.\n\nPutting all this together, [[Randall]] comes up with chart comparing the actor's age to that of the character, and concludes that they have an inverse relationship. Extrapolating this forward, he proposes that McDiarmid (81 years old, as of the publication of this strip) be brought back to play the Emperor as a toddler.\n\nThe joke, of course, is that this kind of extrapolation is ridiculous. In addition to the silliness of the subject matter, the data isn't used properly. Considering that there are only four good data points (plus a fifth where one of the dimensions is unclear, so should be excluded), there is not really sufficient data to make a proper extrapolation from here. Furthermore, three of the data points are clustered closely together, reducing their usefulness as independent markers.\n\nThis comic continues a long theme of applying graphing and extrapolation poorly, and in situations where they're not appropriate, to show the kinds of ridiculous conclusions it can lead to.

For the 2004 DVD release, the scene was reshot with McDiarmid, who was 60 at the time.\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Extrapolation]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]\n[[Category:Scatter plots]]"
