This effectively destroyed the {{w|Netscape}} company, who up until then had the most market share with its browser, {{w|Netscape Navigator}}. Microsoft was involved in {{w|United States v. Microsoft|a legal case}} against the U.S. government, which required Microsoft to allow IE to be uninstalled among other remedies. {{w|Removal of Internet Explorer|Removal of Internet Explorer}} has no clear solution as libraries and utilities associated with Internet Explorer are used across other Windows applications.\n\nThe comic sarcastically states that this stopped companies from creating a monopoly on software practices. Unfortunately, platform developers such as Apple, Sony, and Microsoft have restricted third-party software distribution over the internet via their own [https://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/ curated] [https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/ online] [https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/ stores] in recent years, and will come full circle with the introduction of Metro Applications on the Windows 8. The comic also mocks the triviality of {{w|Browser wars|browser debates}} compared to current antitrust cases concerning [https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/googles-new-search-results-raise-privacy-and-antitrust-concerns/ privacy] and [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-11/u-s-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple-hachette.html price fixing].\n\n{{w|Apple}} bundled a browser on both its desktop and mobile platforms. Apple also requires all iOS developers to sell their apps only through the Apple App Store, paying sizeable commissions to Apple, and Apple can refuse to sell any app. In some instances, Apple has developed its own versions of popular third-party apps.

The company has a majority market share in web search engines, being the most popular search engine available. On {{w|Facebook}}, users face difficulties in accessing or removing their profiles and personal information, among {{w|Criticism of Facebook|other issues}}. Recently, this has been mitigated by the ability to [https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/facebook-now-allows-you-to-download-your-information/ download a zip file] of all content ever posted to Facebook, but it [https://www.zdnet.com/blog/london/facebook-still-doesnt-delete-your-photos-three-years-later/2936 still remains difficult] to delete data from Facebook.\n\nApple has been widely criticized for trying to force all users of Mac OS or iOS to run only content approved by Apple and distributed through the Apple App Store, each sale from which gives royalty payments to Apple.\n\nThe title text refers to mocking Microsoft as Micro$oft or M$ for attempting to take too much money from consumers, and jokingly suggests that the inability to easily do this with other companies' names (Fa¢ebook? Appl€? Goog£e?) is how they succeeded at amassing power where Micro$oft failed.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Megan: Remember when we prosecuted Microsoft for bundling a browser with an OS? Imagine the future we'd live in if we'd been willing to let one tech company amass that much power.\n:Ponytail: Thank God we nipped ''that'' in the bud.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Google]]"
