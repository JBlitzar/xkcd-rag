When it launched there were many [http://www.pcworld.com/article/231368/google_social_network_hands_on_first_impressions.html tech articles] written about G+, which appears to look and/or function similarly to Facebook. In the first panel, [[Megan]] describes G+ as 'not {{w|Facebook}}'. Facebook is a popular social networking site.<sup>&#91;[[285: Wikipedian Protester|''citation needed'']]&#93;</sup> She then describes G+ as being like Facebook.\n\nAfter [[Cueball]] thinks about it in the second frame, he comes to a realization in the third frame that a social network like Facebook, but not related to Facebook, is all he really wanted. This is in reference to the backlash that happens every so often wherein people grow tired of Facebook, its arcane policies, its cavalier attitude toward user privacy and/or its general disdain for end users, and people want to leave Facebook, but have no comparable platform to move their social networking to.\n\nThe title text uses \"you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch\" as both point and counterpoint in an argument, since this fact has both negative (your parents won't see posts you want them to see, and won't be able to post things for you to see) and positive (your parents won't see posts you don't want them to see, and you won't have to worry about keeping up with their posts) implications.\n\nOn April 2, 2019, Google shut down Google+ for consumers. It is still available for users with a {{w|Google Workspace}} account.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Megan: You should join Google+!\n:Cueball: What is it?\n:Megan: Not Facebook!\n:Cueball: What's it like?\n:Megan: Facebook!\n\n:[Cueball considers.]\n\n:Cueball: Oh, what the hell.\n:Cueball: I guess that's all I really wanted.\n:''click''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Google Plus]]"
