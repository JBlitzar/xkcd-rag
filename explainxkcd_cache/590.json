Noinclude tags needed because otherwise the mirror page 590: Papyrus/Font gets added to the same categories, which means every category has a duplicate.

Pretending that he doesn't know that, [[Cueball]] gives [[Ponytail]] a heartfelt card written in that font just to see her twitch. \n\nThe title text says that [[Randall]] actually ''likes'' Papyrus, even if it ''is'' overused, and refers to the fact that he will soon be receiving hate-mail from people who dislike Papyrus. Those mails will be written in {{w|Helvetica}}, another commonly-used sans-serif font that is highly esteemed by typography geeks, designers, and often hipsters. It suggests that the designers would also take the time to check the \"{{w|kerning}}\", editing the spacing between individual letters to be visually pleasing - a time-consuming activity that, it can be suggested, would only be noticed by other designers. See also [[1015: Kerning]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel:]\n:<big>My Hobby:</big>\n:Getting typography geeks heartfelt cards printed in \"Papyrus\" and watching them struggle to act grateful.\n\n:[Ponytail is holding a card, with lines of indiscernible text, open and looking down, specifically neither on the card nor on Cueball, who is watching her instead. An angry tic is flicking on her forehead.]\n:Ponytail: Thank you for the ''*twitch*'' ... lovely... ''*twitch*'' birthday card!<noinclude>\n\n==Trivia==\nSome editors have made a page that is a copy of this explanation in the Papyrus font, which can be accessed on [[590: Papyrus/Font]]. Note that the default browser font will only be overridden if Papyrus is installed on your device.<!--Thank goodness!-->\n</noinclude>\n{{comic discussion}}<!-- \n\nNoinclude tags needed because otherwise the mirror page 590: Papyrus/Font gets added to the same categories, which means every category has a duplicate.
