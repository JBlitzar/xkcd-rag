In terms of the comic, it is the middle \"star\" in the sword/dong of Orion. Dong is an American slang word for penis. The star appears fuzzy to sharp-eyed observers, and the nebulosity is obvious through binoculars or a small telescope.\n\nWhen the speaker says \"We are no strangers to controversy,\" he is probably referring to {{w|Pluto}}'s {{w|IAU definition of planet#Criticism|demotion}} from {{w|planet}} to a {{w|dwarf planet}}/{{w|Plutoid|plutoid}}.\n\nThe title text is a quip about how small and off-kilter the hips are in Orion the constellation compared to the rest of its body, although his hips are not far off the modern comic-style [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332519132_Captain_Dorito_and_the_Bombshell_Supernormal_Stimuli_in_Comics_and_Film \"Captain Dorito\" body type], with a degree of posing in partly side-on perspective.
