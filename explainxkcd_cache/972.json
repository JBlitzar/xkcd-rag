Both comics carry the idea that when you start thinking about your tongue, you can hardly stop thinking about it. (Similarly: if you start thinking about your breathing, you stop breathing unless you consciously think to breathe, same goes for blinking.) This is similar to {{w|Ironic process theory|the ironic process theory}}, where trying to not think about something will invariably make you think about it. The intention of [[Black Hat]] in this comic is for [[Cueball]] to consciously feel his tongue for the entire month of November. Since it was Black Hat's idea, Black Hat probably suffers the same consequences.\n\nThis is similar, in concept, to the expression and phrase used for trolling in online communities, \"[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-are-now-breathing-manually You Are Now Breathing Manually]\". The line \"you are now aware of your tongue\" was mentioned much later in the title text of [[2563: Throat and Nasal Passages]]. Here it was throat and nasal passages awareness which was the subject, due to the, at that time, two year long {{w|2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak|2020 COVID-19 pandemic}}.\n\nHere is the comic in question by Charles Schulz from Peanuts:\n\n[[File:tongue awareness.jpg]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Cueball sit in a room.]\n:Black Hat: Did you know November is Tongue Awareness Month?\n\n:[Cueball is suddenly aware of his tongue.]\n\n:[Cueball continues to be aware of his tongue.]\n\n:[Cueball is painfully aware of his tongue.]\n:Cueball: I hate you.\n:Black Hat: Enjoy the next four weeks.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]] \n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]] <!-- Charles Schultz -->"
