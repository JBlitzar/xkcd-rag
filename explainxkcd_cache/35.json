I forgot what day it was. Anyway, I'll be back Monday, possibly with new drawings about cereal!\n}}\n\nThis was the thirty-seventh comic [[LiveJournal|originally posted to LiveJournal]]. The previous one was [[41: Old Drawing]], and the next one was [[42: Geico]].\n\n==Explanation==\nDue to Randall's vacation, he picked out comics from his old high-school notebooks for the second time in a row. The comic [[520: Cuttlefish]] may be a reference to this comic. It may also be a {{w|Pok√©mon}} reference, with the sheep being the Electric type {{w|Mareep}} or its evolution {{w|Flaaffy}}, and the cactus being {{w|Cacnea}} or {{w|Cacturne}}.\n\nThe title text suggests that it may be the sheep that is zapping the cactus, while the original caption apologizes for the late comic release. This is the second time in a row that a Friday comic was released on a Saturday, as [[32: Pillar]] was also released late.\n\n===Poem by Scott===\nIn the comment section of the original LiveJournal post, Randall's friend [[Scott]] posted a [https://web.archive.org/web/20060529063755/http://xkcd-drawings.livejournal.com/9868.html#:~:text=new%20comment)-,from%20Scott,-(Anonymous)%0A2005 poem about the sheep in the comic].\n\n:I had a little cactus and I treasured it with pride,\n:admiring its spines and dainty flowers.\n:Until the day - oh tragic day! - when it was RAMIFIED,\n:by a ram with strange psychokinetic powers.\n\n:Baaing deep, this shaman sheep came whiffling through the brambles.\n:It gazed upon my cactus and, with yellow flash and thudrous crash,\n:with dashing, brash, and rash panache,\n:it blew the plant to shambles.\n\n:I was, I confess, horrified - I sat and cried my eyes out!\n:Oh stupid sheep, satanic sheep, so wrong and rash and willful!\n:I nursed the cactus best I could, till finally it came about.\n:It grows apace now, once again, but all it blooms is steel wool!\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption in a black frame above the image written in normal letters not all caps:]\n:Another from my high-school notebooks.\n:[A sheep and a green saguaro cactus in a brown pot are linked by an arcing yellow electricity bolt.]\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic was [[:Category:Saturday comics|released on a Saturday]] at 7:28 AM.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 37]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Scott]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
