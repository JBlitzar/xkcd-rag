Mispronouncing the title as DownTOWN Abbey causes Megan to sigh because it is such a common and stupid mistake to fans of the show. Mispronouncing the title changes the meaning from being about the eponymous {{w|Yorkshire}} {{w|Country Estate}} (pronounced ''doun''-tuhn ''ab''-ee /ˌdaʊntən ˈæbi/) to being about a monastery in the midst of a large city (incorrectly pronounced ''doun-toun ab''-ee /ˈdaʊnˌtaʊn ˈæbi/). In the UK the CBD, the Central Business District (the big middly bit), is simply called the \"city centre\". \n\n{{w|LMFAO}} was, at the time of this comic's upload, a ubiquitous group in the US on radio, TV and even strange commercials with [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zJWA3Vo6TU rodents riding in cars with their song, Party Rock Anthem]. However, this comic is a reference to another one of their songs, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZgIYvFu-FQ \"Sexy And I Know It.\"] The relevant lyrics are:\n\n:''sigh''… girl look at that body\n:''sigh''… girl look at that body\n:''sigh''… girl look at that body\n:ah-ah, I work out!\n\nThe title text is referring to the multiple uses of that lyric throughout the song, creating a steady rhythm.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing behind Megan, who's sitting and watching TV.]\n:Cueball: Hey, is that ''Downtown Abbey''? What town is it in the downtown of, anyway?\n:Megan: *siiiiiiigh*\n:Cueball: —''girl look at that body.''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:We should thank ''LMFAO'' for giving us such a great way to respond to exasperated sighs.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]"
