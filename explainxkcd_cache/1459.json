However, the filename is often the primary way of identifying the document you are looking for, and a descriptive title is of huge benefit when trying to find a certain document. Those who are too rushed or too lazy to create a useful filename, or those who don't understand what constitutes a useful filename are setting themselves up for future frustration. When a user creates a new copy of a file in the same directory, the operating system may automatically append \"copy\" or \"Copy of\" to the filename. Subsequent copies of the file have \"copy 2\", \"copy 3\", etc. appended. When searching documents later, the user may struggle to remember which copy is the correct one to use.\n\nThis comic portrays a person, in this case [[White Hat]], who has taken such a naming convention to an extreme, giving hundreds of documents essentially the same confusing or useless filename. [[Cueball]] appears to have a severe distaste for this convention (or may just be in shock at how one could be so lazy or incompetent in the short term to suffer through or ignore the consequences in the long term) and hence provides a [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/protip protip] to never look in someone else's documents folder for the fear of finding these irritating details.\n\nThe .doc and .docx extensions are given to documents created in Microsoft Word, with .docx being the default option from Microsoft Office 2007 onwards. When first saving a document, many programs will default to \"Untitled\", adding numbers to the end as more are created. However, in Microsoft Word the default filename is the first sentence of the document; if the document is still empty, the default filename is \"Doc1\" with the number increasing each time. In order to get such a file directory, White Hat would either have to manually title all of his documents \"Untitled\", or use another app that can use the .docx extension and defaults its filenames to \"Untitled\", like google docs. He appears to frequently make copies, and occasionally made copies of the copies, only very rarely adding a keyword to the file name like \"important\".\n\nIn some cases, White Hat added a minimal amount of detail to the filename, though hasn't removed the redundant \"Untitled X\" portion. This probably adds to Cueball's frustration, because it demonstrates that White Hat does have a basic understanding of the importance of meaningful filenames but hasn't made any attempt to address his systemic problem. Also, the ''Untitled 40 MOM ADDRESS.jpg'' is an image file (jpg), not something that would normally be used to store someone's address: a text file would be more appropriate, for example.\n\nThe title text can refer to one of two common quirks in {{w|Microsoft 365}}. One is of copying and pasting within the same folder on a Windows PC.  The copy of the file will default to the name \"Copy of <original title>\", a second copy becomes \"Copy of Copy of <original title>\" and so forth. The other common quirk that can produce file names like this relates to how Microsoft 365 handles downloaded files that are not saved: the file is actually stored in a temporary folder, allowing the user to preview  and edit it, usually with restrictions, until they actually save a copy. Oftentimes, especially within an office network where files are passed around via email, the other person may just open a file, edit it, and save it as required. Upon attempting to save, the program will prompt one to \"Save a copy of the original file\", as the original file was never actually saved on the hard drive but just opened from a temporary folder, adding the phrase \"Copy of\" to the filename. Forwarding this file will continue this trend adding the phrase \"Copy of\" every time someone opens, edits, and saves the file, thus creating repetitive use of \"Copy of\" within the same name. In a file that is heavily edited and passed around via email like this, if care is not taken to edit it name, the name may fill up with \"Copy of\"s.\n\nIt is rather extreme to get to a 33rd copy of the original untitled.doc file, however, apparently resulting in a 276 characters-long filename, which most operating environments don't allow. Linux sets the limit at 255 characters, and in Windows it's even shorter, as it takes into account the complete folder path. This means the file is 22 characters too long for Linux and at least 25 characters too long for Windows, since being in the root of drive takes 3 characters. Whereas such long names for a file may be uncommon, it is not uncommon in Windows that users run out of characters for the full name and path, if they have several sub folders.\nNote that when performing this type of copying on Windows 7, the new file is named \"<original name> (1)\", not \"Copy of <original name>\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat is sitting at his PC.
