Typically this is summarized as saying they are compensating for having small penises.\n\n{{w|Cyan}} is a greenish-blue color that is not a basic color term in most languages. It is the {{w|complementary color}} to red in the CMYK (subtractive) or RGB (additive) color models.\n\n[[Megan]], upon seeing [[Hairy]] drive past in a red convertible, tells [[Cueball]] that Hairy must be compensating for his cyan colored penis.\n\nThis comic thus generalizes the original stereotype to an assumption that men drive cars that compensate for problems/properties with their penis (e.g. large car for small penis). Under this principle, a red car would complement (be the opposite of) a cyan penis. This is of course ridiculous, as red cars are quite common and cyan penises either extremely rare or nonexistent;{{Citation needed}} but maybe Megan doesn't realize this, or is joking.\n\nThere may also be a reference to the Doppler shift, where an object moving away (such as a galaxy) appears slightly redder than its true color. On the contrary, objects moving closer shift blue or cyan. However, cars cannot go nearly as fast to create a change in the perceived color. {{cn}}\n\nIn the title text another pair of opposites are mentioned: {{w|acid}} and {{w|alkaline}}. Acidity is an extremely odd property to try to compensate for with one's choice of car. Additionally, most penises share the same basic chemical composition and therefore the same acidity. If your penis can be described as \"highly acidic\", you probably have a major medical problem. Again this could be Megan's lack of understanding, and since some models of cars are called [http://jalopnik.com/5327974/why-cant-you-get-a-nice-basic-car-these-days basic cars] (instead of a special red convertible) she could make the (wrong) assumption that they drive a basic car to compensating for their acidic penises.\n\nThus, this comic is referring to the actual definition of \"compensation\", which means to balance something out by adding another. If an image has too much red value on the RGB scale, one could shift it more towards neutral by adding to the blue value. And a solution with a low (acidic) pH can be neutralized by mixing it with an alkaline solution to bring its pH to a neutral value. (Whereas a big car will not balance out a small penis!{{Citation needed}})\n\nAn alternative interpretation to this just being about opposites is that of a more specific big vs small compensation. In each case the car represents something larger than Hairy's penis: in the comic - red has a \"bigger\" (longer) wavelength than cyan. Similarly in the title text, alkali has a \"bigger\" (higher) ph than acid. Of course against this alternative is that red has a smaller energy/frequency than cyan and that you would often talk about stronger acids, making a low ph count as strong, not small! Finally the joke loses some value if it is still just a matter of big/small rather than actual properties of the penis that are being compensated for.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are standing next to an intersection as Hairy drives by in a red convertible.]\n:Megan: I bet he just drives that car to overcompensate for his cyan penis.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Penis]]"
