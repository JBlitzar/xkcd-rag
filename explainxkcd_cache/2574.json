PLEASE SPARE MY LIFE!\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] and [[White Hat]] are going somewhere in need of tickets (a concert, the airport, etc.), and Cueball asks White Hat if he is ready to go, who affirms this but asks for Cueball to email him the tickets before they go.\n\nWhen Cueball does this he apparently opts to send them to White Hat's work email address. When White Hat is not at work, he has an {{w|autoresponder}} activated that tells people to not disturb him as he is not at work. Usually this means that his email server sends an automatic response telling the sender of the mail that he is not at work, and not to expect an immediate reply.\n\nBut in this comic, White Hat has a physical autoresponder standing behind him, drawn as a human with thicker/rougher lines as if clad in bulky clothing, wearing spiky knee and elbow guards and a spike-embossed and notably scarred crash-helmet upon its head. It holds a glinting, sharp sword in its hand. When Cueball inadvertently activates it, it plunges forward to 'defend' White Hat from being disturbed by work related things during his spare time. It is so aggressive that it even violently pushes White Hat out of the way, with a blow to the face so that he falls back and dislodges his hat, as it prepares to confront the perpetrator, Cueball.\n\nIn the caption below, [[Randall]] states that he feels bad when he activates his friends' autoresponders. It is unclear if this is because he thinks he disturbs them with what they might think is work, because he then knows he will not get a reply or if he feels attacked (like Cueball in the comic) by their \"aggressively worded\" auto-replies.\n\nIn the title text Cueball shouts out (in all caps) to the autoresponder \"I admire how you set boundaries and I hope your colleagues respect them! Please spare my life!\"  He therefore thinks it is a ''good'' idea to have time away from work where you cannot be contacted by your colleagues.\n\nIt is unclear if the autoresponder is a human or a robot, but the open-faced helmet reveals the fringe and neck-length hair generally seen on female characters, although for instance [[Megan]]'s hair is usually longer and not so messy as this creature. This would be reminiscent of the [[:Category:Android|Android series]], especially [[600: Android Boyfriend]], where one of the androids moves past its owner. It may also be a reference to ''{{w|Homestuck}}'', a webcomic which features an autoresponder as a real, living being.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and White Hat are talking to each other while Cueball is typing on his smartphone. A dark-haired figure stands behind White Hat, drawn with thicker/rougher lines as if clad in bulky clothing; wearing spiky knee and elbow guards, a spike-embossed and notably scarred crash-helmet upon its head; and is holding a glinting sharp sword in its hand.]\n:Cueball: Ready to go?\n:White Hat: Yup! Can you email me the tickets before we leave?\n:Cueball: Sure, one sec.\n\n:[The next panel is nested inside the first, although at first it just looks like two individual panels. This could indicate the second panel is an immediate response to the first. The armored figure aggressively moves forward towards Cueball, who drops his phone in surprise. The armored figure has its sword-arm raised, the other hand pushing White Hat behind it, by pushing him in the face which causes him to stumble backwards so his hat starts to fall off.] \n:Cueball: Okay, I sent it to-\n:Armored figure: ''It is outside work hours!''\n:Armored figure: ''Prepare to die!''\n:Cueball: ''Augh!''\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I always feel bad when I trigger my friends' work autoresponders.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis was the ninth comic to come out after the [[Countdown in header text]] started and the one on the front page when it ended!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Email]]"
