This is further emphasized when [[Megan]] mentions {{w|Metallica}}, a very famous band that mostly everyone can be assumed to have heard of, and [[Cueball]] has no clue who they are, because Metallica is not featured in ''Guitar Hero'' (at the time of this comic writing). A similar premise was demonstrated in [[1859: Sports Knowledge]].\n\n''{{w|Guitar Hero}}'' is a music rhythm video game developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for the {{w|Playstation 2}}.\n\nIn the title text, Cueball (or possibly Randall) is just hoping for a sequel to ''Guitar Hero'' to get more, and newer, conversational material. By 2015, there had been 6 main sequels to ''Guitar Hero'', with numerous other spinoffs and expansions to the {{w|Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series}}.\n\n===List of bands mentioned===\n\n'''Classic Rock'''\n*{{w|Boston (band)|Boston}} is an American rock band from Boston, who had their most success in the 1970s and 1980s. Their song \"{{w|More Than a Feeling}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''.\n*{{w|Queen (band)|Queen}} is a British rock band from London, formed in 1970, with many major hits. Their song \"{{w|Killer Queen}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''. \n*\"Bowie\" ({{w|David Bowie}}) was an English singer and songwriter. His song \"{{w|Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''. \n*{{w|Joan Jett}} is an American rock singer. She is best known for her work as the frontwoman of her band, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts. Their version of the song \"{{w|I Love Rock 'n' Roll}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''. \n\n'''Newer stuff'''\n*{{w|Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand}} are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 2002. Their song \"{{w|Take Me Out (song)|Take Me Out}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''. \n*{{w|The Donnas}} were an American rock band formed in Palo Alto, California in 1993. Their song \"{{w|Spend the Night (The Donnas album)|Take it Off}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''.  \n*{{w|Audioslave}} was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. Their song \"{{w|Cochise (song)|Cochise}}\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero''.    \n\n'''Other stuff'''\n*{{w|Arcade Fire}} is a Canadian indie rock band founded in 2000.\n*{{w|The Postal Service|Postal Service}} was an American indie rock band founded in 2001.\n*{{w|Freezepop}} is an American electronic band from Boston. Their song \"Get Ready 2 Rokk\" is featured in ''Guitar Hero'', as a bonus song. This is the first giveaway of Cueball's source for his music knowledge; Freezepop is a fairly obscure indie band best known for their placement in ''Guitar Hero'' and other rhythm games.\n*{{w|Metallica}} is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California. Metallica has won 9 Grammy awards and received 23 Grammy nominations. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nInterestingly, neither {{w|Arcade Fire}} nor {{w|The Postal Service|Postal Service}} (mentioned by Megan) are featured in ''Guitar Hero'', so Cueball should not have any knowledge of these bands. Perhaps he brought up Freezepop as a distraction, since Megan mentioned that The Postal Service also has electronic music.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball converse.]\n:Megan: What kind of music do you listen to?\n:Cueball: Oh, a mix of things. Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...\n:Megan: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.\n:Cueball: But there's some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.\n:Megan: Sometimes they're a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.\n:Cueball: Oh yeahâ€”have you ever checked out Freezepop?\n:Megan: Mhm! Synth pop can be fun, but at the same time, I agree that sometimes you just need to blast some Metallica.\n:Cueball: Who?\n:Megan: ...Metallica.\n:Cueball: Are they new?\n:I sound pretty knowledgeable about music until people figure out that I'm just naming bands from Guitar Hero.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In his [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOS0sV2a24#t=42m20s Google-speech] in late 2007, [[Randall]] expressed some form of dissatisfaction with ''Guitar Hero III'' (coincidentally the first edition in the series to include a Metallica song).\n*In 2009, three years after this comic was released, ''Metallica'' eventually got a game {{w|Guitar Hero: Metallica}}.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Rhythm Games]]\n[[Category:Guitar Hero]]"
