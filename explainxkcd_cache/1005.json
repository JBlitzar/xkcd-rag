The bills contained the ability for the US government to deny American internet users access to certain sites at a judge's request. These would be activated if the government could prove to a court that a site was primarily used to harbor illegally distributed copyrighted goods, such as video games, music, and TV shows.\n\nMany people considered this to be censorship and were concerned that this could instead be used by larger corporations to squelch smaller competing sites who may not have the resources to challenge a \"take-down notice\" in court, should judges continually agree with the larger corporation.\n\nAs the bills gained infamy online, many popular websites and web comics participated in a mass protest on January 18, 2012, to announce their displeasure with the bill in an attempt to convince the House of Representatives to reverse their judgement, which had at the time been considered likely to pass if drafted. \n\nThis was [[xkcd|xkcd's]] participation in the protest. [[Randall]] discusses below the black panel that if he was having better copyright protection with these new acts then he would never have gotten this popular since his fans would not have been allowed to distribute the comic gaining him new followers. \n\nIn typical xkcd fashion, this comic contains several layers of depth that may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. In this instance, the apparently solid-black region contains a hidden image revealed with simple brightness+contrast manipulation (or simply loading the image into Microsoft Paint and using the fill tool), with [[Black Hat]] saying \"A message from sysadmins everywhere: Seriously, don't screw with DNS. If you break this internet, we are ''<u>not</u>'' making you a new one.\" This stems from the fact that sites could be ordered taken down by allowing manipulation of the {{w|DNS}} itself, effectively making a site completely disappear from the web. This court-enforced DNS manipulation was considered by many technical professionals to damage the underlying structure of the internet, as well as potentially criminalizing recent work to improve its security.\n\n[[File:sopa hidden message.png||upright=2|The comic image with the message revealed.]]\n\nThe title text referred to a common theme across protesting sites: a {{w|Protests against SOPA and PIPA|blackout of the internet}}. Sites such as Google changed to a black background, while Wikipedia prevented access by linking their sites to a black page with white text explaining their participation. On the day of the protest, xkcd was similarly \"blacked out,\" with all comics redirecting to this one. The humor is that Randall has jokingly misinterpreted this \"blackout\" to mean that he should instead protest by \"getting totally {{w|Blacking out|blacked out}}\" â€“ i.e. by drinking so much {{w|Alcoholic drink|alcohol}} that he {{w|Drunk|gets drunk}}, {{w|Passing out|passes out}}, and wakes up the next day having no memory of his actions or experiences during his drunkenness; despite Randall's good intentions, this would probably not help the protest against SOPA/PIPA.{{cn}}\n\nAfter the protest, the bills were postponed from being drafted on January 20, 2012.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A completely black panel with white text. All non-capital letter, in square brackets:]\n::[don't censor the web.]\n\n:[Hidden in the background, and only visible under certain conditions, is an inverted Black Hat (i.e. white), with the text from above still visible written across his forehead. Above him is the first line of text, and then he speaks the next line:]\n:A message from sysadmins everywhere:\n:Black Hat: Seriously, don't screw with DNS.  If you break this internet, we are <u>''not''</u> making you a new one.\n\n:[Below the black panel is a visible message from Randall written normally black on white in xkcd style.]\n:I make my living drawing xkcd, which wouldn't have been possible if people \n:hadn't been able to freely share my comics with each other all over the internet. \n:As a copyright holder and small business owner, I oppose SOPA and PIPA. \n:[Randall Munroe's signature, with a little drawing of Cueball on one of the tails.
