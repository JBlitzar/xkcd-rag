Megan is initially against the idea, stating that treating emotionally-charged personal issues as if they were academic debates would not work. Cueball argues that it would force each person to consider the other's point of view. However, when Megan reconsiders, accepts his argument, and appears to agree that they should try it, Cueball abruptly switches his position to thinking that it's a terrible idea. The joke is that once Megan agrees with him, he employs his Wright Brothers suggestion and takes her initial position that the idea was bad. Thus, the two have switched their arguments and are now exploring the other sides. They may continue in this way to form a well balanced conclusion on the proposal or continually switch sides without ever concluding the argument.\n\nThe title text suggests that [[Randall]] may either be misremembering the fact that the Wright brothers used this technique, or not be convinced that the source is reliable, but has decided to assume it is true just so that he could make the joke in this comic.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking to each other.]\n:Cueball: I've heard that when the Wright brothers argued, they periodically switched sides in the debate to try to encourage a more balanced conclusion.\n:Cueball: We should try that in our relationship!\n\n:Megan: It's a neat idea, but I think treating personal issues like a debate will only engender hostility and hurt feelings.\n\n:Cueball: No, I think it would help, by forcing us to consider the other person's point of view.\n\n:Megan: Hmm, maybe you're right.\n:Cueball: Am not. It's a bad idea.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
