'How do I know you'll return the broom once you've secured your ticket?' 'I'll leave my little dog as collateral.' 'Great. Pleasure doing business!'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Megan]] plays the part of {{w|Dorothy Gale|Dorothy}}, the {{w|protagonist}} of ''{{w|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}''. Dorothy has been trapped in the {{w|Land of Oz}} due to {{w|Tornado|extreme weather}} and must obtain transportation home. An off-screen character, presumably the {{w|Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz}} himself, offers her a ride if she obtains the {{w|The Wicked Witch of the West}}'s magic broom. Megan wears {{w|Ruby Slippers}} and uses them as a bargaining chip to obtain the Witch's broom.\n\nThe \"little dog\" offered in the title text is Dorothy's faithful companion {{w|Toto (Oz)|Toto}}.\n\n{{w|The Wicked Witch of the West}} is a fictional character and the most significant antagonist in ''The Wizard of Oz'', which is based on L. Frank Baum's children's book ''{{w|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}''. In the 1939 version of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the Wicked Witch flies on her broom over the Emerald City demanding Dorothy's surrender, and the Wizard demands the destruction of the Witch with her broom as proof, in exchange for granting the wishes of Dorothy and her companions.\n\nThe point of the comic is to show how easily Dorothy could resolve the situation if she was willing to forsake both her traveling companions and her pet. She leaves Toto with the Witch; it is unclear whether she plans to retain possession of the broom and return it in order to collect him, or plans to abandon Toto as well. She will also leave Oz completely at the mercy of said witch by giving her the Ruby Slippers and leaving with the Wizard.\n\nIt should be noted that this resolution defies the canon established in the movie, as nobody could remove the slippers [http://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/wizard-of-oz-the/quote_26335.html as long as Dorothy lived], presumably including Dorothy herself. Additionally, it turns out that the Wizard was a fraud and was unable to take her home, and ironically it is the ruby slippers that did so.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz was also referenced in [[Five-Minute Comics: Part 4]], and [[1427: iOS Keyboard]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan wearing red shoes talking to somebody off-screen.]\n:Off-screen: ''Bring me the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West and I'll take you home.''\n:Megan: Got it.\n\n:[Megan wearing red shoes standing before steps.]\n:Megan: You can have the slippers if you let me borrow your broom.\n:Off-screen: Deal.\n\n:[Megan carrying a broom and singing without wearing the red shoes.]\n\n:[Megan flying in a balloon over three ''Wizard of Oz'' characters.]\n:Megan: That was easy.\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]"
