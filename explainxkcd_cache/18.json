The previous one was [[17: What If]], and the next one was [[19: George Clinton]].\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Snapple}} is a brand of beverages that mostly sells bottled juices and teas. Its name is based on a carbonated apple juice the company once produced (\"snappy apple\"). In this comic, [[Cueball]] hands another Cueball-like guy an apple calling it a \"Snapple\". When the guy bites into it, his teeth are blocked by the apple's metallic surface because Cueball has infused the apple with tin. {{w|Tin}} is a metallic element whose abbreviation on the periodic table is \"Sn\" (as the Latin word for tin is \"stannum\"). Thus, the \"tin apple\" could be referred to as a \"Sn-apple\". The fourth panel is a silent wide shot, perhaps suggesting the joke was met with silence as a weak joke. As a meta-joke, the final panel might jokingly suggest that the silence is because those unfamiliar with the periodic table of elements don't get the joke. According to the caption at the top, [[James Zetlen]] presumably once made a joke to [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] similar to the one in the comic.\n\nThe title text continues the trend in early xkcd comics of explaining the joke rather than expanding on it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Above the frames:]\n:This one is entirely James' fault.\n\n:[Two Cueball-like guys are standing and talking.]\n:Cueball: Here, take a bite of this Snapple.\n:Friend: food!\n\n:[Cueball's friend takes a bite.]\n:Friend: Ow!  What is this?\n:''Clink''\n\n:[The panel switches to Cueball.]\n:Cueball: It's an apple infused with tin.\n\n:[Beat panel. A wide shot of the two.]\n\n:[Same scene, except the panel is lightly shaded and there is a box above saying:]\n:Those of you who know your periodic table should be laughing right about now.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis is the first xkcd comic featuring [[James Zetlen]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 17]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring James Zetlen]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:Periodic table]]"
