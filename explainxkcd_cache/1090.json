'There must be some context we're missing.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nThis joke is a play on the phrase {{w|context-free grammar}}, which is a technical term used in {{w|formal languages|formal language}} theory.\n\nCueball crashes Megan's speech on formal language theory, nonsensically shouts \"Grammar!\" without any context, and runs off. Because the gag is delivered in a particularly obtuse manner, the title text clears things up by having the confused audience mention \"missing context\", thus having them unwittingly explain the joke.\n\nThe concept of context-free grammar is incredibly nuanced and nigh impossible to rephrase in layman's terms. Luckily, the joke only interprets the phrase \"context-free grammar\" literally, so no understanding of the actual subject is required.\n\nA context-free grammar can be described as a dictionary, translating single symbols to one or multiple symbols, who then are replaced again, until no further replacements are possible. If a string of symbols adheres to this grammar, it can be reconstructed solely by following these kind of orders.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A large banner is hanging over a podium, where a speaker (Megan) is standing behind a lectern. Cueball crashes through the left side of the panel, scattering glass.]\n:Banner. 10th Annual Symposium on Formal Languages\n:''Crash''\n\n:[Cueball stops in front of Megan spreads out his hands and shouts:]\n:Cueball: Grammar!\n\n:[Cueball then runs off the right side of the panel, so swiftly he leaves a cloud of dust in his wake. Megan at the podium just looks after him silently.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Logic]]\n[[Category:Language]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Public speaking]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
