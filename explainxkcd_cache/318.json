A shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive, disgusting, and/or disturbing to its viewers, containing materials of high shock value that is also considered distasteful and crude, and is generally of a pornographic, scatological, extremely violent, insulting, painful, profane, or otherwise provocative nature.\n\nThis comic is a direct reference to the former shock site {{w|goatse.cx}} that displayed a human distended anus (among other things). The domain was taken down in 2004, but it remains a memorable cultural reference from its time period. It therefore may be cited as nostalgia by trolls in the future. This comic evidently takes place in the future, as the characters are using some sort of advanced levitation technology that has yet to exist.\n\nThe title text warns us not to Google this meme, as it contains some horrifying results. If you ignore the warning from the title text and Google for \"distended anus,\" you will find many results on this awful dysfunction like {{w|rectal prolapse}}.\n\nFurthermore, the aforementioned shock site still exists.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan, both wearing headsets with antennae, sunglasses, and jetpacks, are hovering.]\n:Cueball: Darling, let's put on our best fake accounts, connect to the core ForumSpace, and trick people into looking at a picture of a man's distended anus!\n:Megan: Oh, it'll be just like old times!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]"
