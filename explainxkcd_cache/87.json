It's been over thirteen years, buddy.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic refers to the film ''{{w|Jurassic Park}}'', a 1993 movie based on the 1990 novel by {{w|Michael Crichton}}. The film depicts a billionaire who buys an island and opens a zoo/theme park for dinosaurs cloned from DNA recovered from blood found in fossilized mosquitoes. Naturally, everything goes haywire, and several of the creatures, among which are the {{w|velociraptor}}s subject of this comic, try to devour every human in the theme park.\n\nVelociraptors (often shortened as \"{{w|Dromaeosauridae|raptors}}\") are a species of relatively small, carnivorous {{w|dinosaur}} that play a central role in the original film and its sequels. In the film, packs of Velociraptors attack the main characters at various points, even entering buildings; they play a large role in the climax of the film. According to Wikipedia, the velociraptors in the film were erroneously based on {{w|Deinonychus}}. The movie depicts the velociraptors as having scaly reptilian skin, though dinosaurs of this type are now theorized to have been feathered.\n\nAs we see in this [[:Category:Velociraptors|and future]] comics, even though it had been approximately thirteen years since he presumably first saw the film, [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] apparently has lived in perpetual fear of a real raptor attack. Specifically, in this comic, he worries how a building would stand up against the creatures. The main risk posed by the house depicted comes by the large window in the living room, through which a Velociraptor could break in (Randall apparently believes that the bathroom window is too high for them to reach and the door too secure to break through).\n\nThe image text points out what he presumes is the reader's disbelief that ''Jurassic Park'' had (as of 2006) been released so long ago (thirteen years prior). This is another classic xkcd premise that will later be the subject of [[891: Movie Ages]] five years later, which includes ''Jurassic Park'' again. This is the first in a long line of comments and comics Randall has made about how realizing the release dates of things in popular culture can make us feel old.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Picture of a suburban house, with lines pointing to various aspects.]\n\n:High bathroom window: probably secure.\n\n:Outer door: secure.\n\n:Picture window: VELOCIRAPTOR ENTRY POINT!\n\n:It's been over a decade since Jurassic Park opened, and I still size up buildings for their potential as shelter against Velociraptor attacks.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic marks the first reference in [[xkcd]] to ''{{w|Jurassic Park}}'', and specifically to [[Randall]]'s fear of [[:Category:Velociraptors|velociraptors]]. The fear will continue to be a subject of future comics and running jokes.\n\nThis is the first comic featuring perspective.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Velociraptors]]\n[[Category:Jurassic Park]]\n[[Category:Comics to make one feel old]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
