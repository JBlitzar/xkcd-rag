This is why the president in the comic is out-of-panel and therefore not revealed to us. As it would turn out, the president inaugurated in January 2009 was Barack Obama, who has gone on to demonstrate a tactical use of the Internet (including the more frivolous aspects of it) for public relations purposes. The suppositional president in the comic is less savvy.\n\nThis series was released on five consecutive days (Monday to Friday) and not over the usual schedule of three comics a week. It may be a continuation of the comic [[493: Actuarial]], in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was nominated as Internet secretary. These are all the comics in [[:Category:Secretary|Secretary series]]:\n* [[494: Secretary: Part 1]]\n* [[495: Secretary: Part 2]]\n* [[496: Secretary: Part 3]]\n* [[497: Secretary: Part 4]]\n* [[498: Secretary: Part 5]]\n\nThe tubes being clogged is a reference to the, now deceased, Alaska Senator {{w|Ted Stevens}} who, during a congressional debate on {{w|net neutrality}}, described the {{w|Internet}} as a {{w|series of tubes}} (be sure to listen to the audio clips in that Wikipedia page, and you'll see why he became a big hit with the Internet). Ted Stevens also gained notoriety for backing a proposal to build a {{w|Gravina Island Bridge|bridge to nowhere}} using federal funds. The question \"What are they a-Twitter about now?\" refers to the website {{w|Twitter}}, which is a microblogging and social networking site.\n\nThe tubes being clogged may also be reference to numerous sites on the Internet - such as \"{{w|Tube site}}\" (a.k.a \"Porn 2.0\"); {{w|Youtube}}; various other sites with \"tube\" in it, mostly video-hostings (e.g. {{w|Rutube}}, {{w|PeerTube}}, {{w|SchoolTube}}, {{w|TeacherTube}}, {{w|TroopTube}}; {{w|DTube}} didn't exist back then). In which case, \"we put too much stuff on them\" likely means overwhelming amounts of content (e.g. videos, pictures). In that case, it could count as \"{{tvtropes|AccidentalInnuendo|accidental innuendo}}\", considering ''what'' \"tubes\", \"stuff\" and overly \"restless\" bloggers would mean in context of Porn 2.0 and [[495: Secretary: Part 2|/b/ board]].\n\nCats are notorious for being hard to herd, thus the idiom \"herding cats,\" meaning an extremely difficult task that can very quickly get away from anyone undertaking it. {{w|Lolcats}} are pictures of cats, usually in humorous poses, that have insipid captions on them. The conflation of lolcats and the herding idiom escaped the president (who is presumably somebody not familiar with the former term). The title text refers to [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat Ceiling Cat], a lolcat parody of God. As with cats, Bloggers are an ideologically diverse bunch, and they are hard to get to go in a single direction. The proposed \"Secretary of the Internet\" would likely be a new position on the President's {{w|Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet}}, which currently consists of the heads of 15 executive departments and are, with the one exception of the Attorney General (who heads the Department of Justice), titled \"Secretary of ''Department''.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:Spring 2009â€” The new president faces a crisis...\n:[Cueball is talking to an unseen Mr. President, who is sitting behind a desk.]\n:Cueball: Mr. President, the bloggers are restless.\n:Mr. President: What are they a-twitter about now?\n\n:Cueball: It's the tubes sir.
