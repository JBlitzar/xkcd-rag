He had the hard drive divided into six partitions, C: through J:, with a 'Documents' directory tree on each one. Each new file appeared to be saved to a partition at random. I knew enough not to ask.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nA relative of [[Cueball]] is depicted, who explains how he goes about sending a {{w|YouTube}} video to someone. The relative appears to be a stereotypical 'non-computer person', perhaps the father or grandfather of Cueball. The relative explains how he first saves a web page and opens it in Microsoft Word, then uses the 'Share' feature in Word to generate an email that contains the web page reformatted as a Word document, then sends that email to a service that extracts YouTube videos. Perhaps this service would then email back a link to some extracted file on some server, and this link could in turn be copied and pasted in another email, which could finally be sent to the intended recipient. It's all very complicated.\n\nThe premise is that, without the proper know how, the solutions less computer-literate people will find to achieve some task on a computer will usually end up convoluted, sadly unaware that their method is subpar without a proper frame of reference. In this case, a much faster and simpler route would be to simply copy the address of the YouTube video from the address bar in the browser, then paste the address in an email to the intended recipient.\n\nThe caption goes on to muse that, due to this, though [[Randall]] encourages his relatives to solve their computer problems on their own by trial and error, he has to resist the urge of asking them the method they used as the suboptimality will cause Randall to be exasperated. Telling them a more optimal solution would likely upset their relative since they are now \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" regarding Randall being dissastified with them, and any supposed time saved by Randall not having to do tech support for his family would also be rendered moot.\n\nThe title text gives another example of bizarre scenarios that people who don't understand computers can end up with. {{w|Disk partitioning|Partition}}s on a hard drive are separately managed regions of storage, usually used for recovery purposes or to load different operating systems. While some systems and users have a separate partition to store one's personal files so as to allow wiping the partition containing the operating system and reinstall without those files being affected, using multiple partitions to store files offers no benefit compared to run-of-the-mill folders (and, in fact, might be worse as unlike folders partition sizes are not easy to change). A truly grotesque scene.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A relative stands at a computer terminal. Cueball stands behind him with his head in his hands, double-facepalming.]\n\n:Relative: See, I've got a really good system: if I want to send a YouTube video to someone, I go to File â†’ Save, then import the saved page into Word. Then I go to \"Share this Document\" and under \"recipient\" I put the email of this video extraction service...\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:I'll often encourage relatives to try to solve computer problems themselves by trial and error. However, I've learned an important lesson: if they say they've solved their problem, ''never'' ask how.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
