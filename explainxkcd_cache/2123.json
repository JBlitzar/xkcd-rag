Just about anything can be collected, however, some things are collected much more often than others. Wikipedia has a page listing the most popular categories of such {{w|collectible}} items.\n\nIn Randall's usual style of going meta with everything, he decided to start a meta-collectionâ€”a collection of examples of different things that people can collect. He uses Wikipedia's {{w|list of collectibles}} for reference. In the comic, [[Cueball]] is showing to his friend his collection of various items that have nothing in common except that they're all popular collectibles. So while most people try to collect everything in one narrow category of collectibles, Cueball's collection will only be complete if he can get one item from each of the list of collectible items as cataloged by Wikipedia's list, so he has a collection of representative elements from all collections.\n\nIn the title text, Randall complains about a Wikipedia editor who keeps adding {{w|yacht}}s to the list of collectibles, probably because it would force him to buy a yacht if he ever wanted to complete his collection of collectibles. Yachts are traditionally considered immensely expensive and the vast majority of people own zero yachts, let alone a collection of them.{{Citation needed}} Note that Randall does not specify how he is trying to get the page locked, and the comic itself might be a rather meta way of doing so: xkcd fans have a history of making lots of edits to Wikipedia articles Randall mentions, resulting in them being protected or locked. The article has in fact been edited and reverted about 50 times by these fans over the course of a single day and was {{w|special:redirect/logid/97716186|temporarily protected}} on March 14th, 2019, which expired three days later. The first addition of Yachts to this page was by a user named {{w|Special:Contributions/Xkcd2123|Xkcd2123}}, but it is unlikely that this user is Randall.\n\n===List of Items on the Shelf===\nItems are numbered on each shelf from left.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Item Location\n!Description\n|-\n|Top Shelf, First Item\n|Possibly an urn or cookie jar.\n|-\n|Top Shelf, Second Item\n|Possibly a candle\n|-\n|Top Shelf, Third Item\n|Model boat\n|-\n|Middle Shelf, First Item\n|Possibly a book\n|-\n|Middle Shelf, Second Item\n|Unidentifiable small item, maybe a rock or tooth\n|-\n|Middle Shelf, Third Item\n|Compact disc in case\n|-\n|Middle Shelf, Fourth Item\n|A record, probably vinyl but could possibly be shellac as shellac \"78s\" are popular collectors items.\n|-\n|Middle Shelf, Fifth Item\n|Unidentifiable rectangular item, possibly a collectible card\n|-\n|Middle Shelf, Sixth Item\n|Unidentifiable small item\n|-\n|Bottom Shelf, First Item\n|Humanoid figurine or action figure\n|-\n|Bottom Shelf, Second Item\n|Martini glass\n|-\n|Bottom Shelf, Third Item\n|Teapot\n|-\n|Bottom Shelf, Fourth Item\n|Possibly a coin on a stand\n|-\n|Bottom Shelf, Fifth Item\n|Salt/pepper shaker, chess piece, or {{w|Pez dispenser}}\n|-\n|Bottom Shelf, Sixth Item\n|Unidentifiable small item\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[The comic depicts Cueball reading from a list to White Hat, standing next to a case filled with collectables including an urn, a model ship, a compact disc, a vinyl record, a doll or figurine, a martini glass, and a teapot.]\n:Today we're looking for a lunchbox, a snow globe, a Maytag dryer, a Harley Davidson, and a stamp.\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:My hobby: Collecting one item from every category listed on Wikipedia's \"List of collectables.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n\nAs of 13 March 2019 at 6:44 PM ET, there ''was'' a debate on the Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_collectables#May_consider_a_temporary_editing_protection talk] tab about locking this page.\nThis has now been upheld, and the page was temporarily locked.\n\nAs of 25 May 2019 at 10:25 PM ET, the page was unlocked and yachts were back on the list.\n:As of 04 July 2024 at 06:40 UTC there are no yachts to be found on the list.\n:As of 15 August 2025 at 13:25 UTC yachts ARE on the list.\n\nA previous comic, [[739: Malamanteau]], also caused a similar situation on Wikipedia, with many xkcd fans attempting to create the fictional page. The page has been turned into a redirect to the Wikipedia page for xkcd.\n\nAnother previous comic, [[1052: Every Major's Terrible]], also caused a similar situation on Wikipedia, with many xkcd readers attempting to redirect \"Physics major\" to \"Engineer\".\n\nTotal Collection Value\nGRAND TOTAL: $63,617.00\nAdditional insights:\n\nThe classic/vintage car alone represents 62.88% of the total collection value\nWithout the car, the collection would cost $23,617.00\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:My Hobby]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]"
