An {{w|astronomical interferometer}} uses this principle to build an array of separate telescopes that are able to work together as a single telescope, effectively providing higher resolution using a process known as {{w|Aperture Synthesis|aperture synthesis}}.\n\nIn the comic, [[Beret Guy]] and [[Cueball]] are walking Beret Guy's dogs when Beret Guy makes a comment on how interferometry is really cool. Beret Guy states that two dogs placed at a consistent interval will function as a larger dog &mdash; a play on the astronomical interferometer. While this idea works on waves, it probably won't work on dogs{{Citation needed}} (though since h/p=Î» it might), which is why Cueball is confused and starts to correct him. Before he can respond, however, Beret Guy jumps on his \"large\" dog and appears to be floating in midair. The existence of a large dog is further proven when it gives out a large bark. Cueball looks on speechless while Beret Guy appears to exhibit another of his [[:Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy|strange powers]]: he perceives reality in a certain way and reality alters itself to how he perceives it.\n\nIn [[1614: Kites]], Beret Guy is \"walking\" a dog. It is possible that one of the dogs in this comic is the dog from that comic.\n\nThe title text states that the effective giant dog is not any more 'good' than the two original dogs. This is analogous to sensitivity for astronomical interferometers. Interferometry does not increase the light-gathering area, so it cannot view dim objects as well as a single large telescope could. This is also a reference generally to dog-owners calling their dogs \"good dog\" or \"good boy/girl\" when they behave well; presumably, Beret Guy's giant interferometry dog is only as well-behaved as the dogs they are derived from. (However, as interferometry does collect more light than any individual telescope used, the interferometry dog is presumably more good than either individual dog. Considering the destructive potential of a giant bad dog, this is a good thing.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is walking behind Beret Guy, who is walking two small dogs on two leashes.]\n:Beret Guy: Interferometry. Is so cool!\n\n:[They stop and Beret Guy is holding the leashes in his hand. He has taken them off the dogs and points at the dogs, which he has placed facing outward so they are standing a couple of paces apart. The distance between them is indicated by a labeled line.]\n:Beret Guy: If you put two small dogs a large distance apart, they can function as a single giant dog.\n:Line: d\n\n:[Cueball begins to speak but is cut off by Beret Guy yelling as he jumps into the space above the two dogs, with each leg a good distance above one of the dogs. (The leashes have disappeared, as well as the distance line).]\n:Cueball: I'm not sure that's-\n:Beret Guy: '''''Hyah!'''''\n\n:[As Cueball watches, Beret Guy floats on top of the invisible giant dog about a meter above the two small dogs, and then rides away with the two small dogs still seen below as they run to the right, leaving Cueball standing in the dust the \"big\" dog creates in its wake. The invisible giant dog barks from a position just in front of Beret Guy's face, far above the two small dogs.]\n:Invisible giant dog:  <big>'''''WOOF'''''</big>\n:Beret Guy: ''Away!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Strange powers of Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]"
