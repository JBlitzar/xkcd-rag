Many of them are named, although only one generally accepted position is named after a number: the {{w|69 (sex position)|69}}.\n\n[[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] try to approximate the shapes of the numbers, which they are given by the narrator, as sex positions. They start with the classic 69, then represent the number 99 as \"spooning\" while standing and the number 71 as \"doggy-style\" sex over a table. They are then given ever more difficult numbers to attempt, first 34 (maybe referencing {{w|Rule 34 (Internet meme)|rule 34 of the internet}}) - Cueball exclaims ''Uh'' as he has no idea how to make a 3 (maybe he's supposed to curl up in a fetal position), although Megan does try (in vain) to form a 4. Then they are completely baffled by {{w|square root|√8}} (AKA 2√2 or ≈ 2.82842712475) (presumably one of them is to contort into a figure-eight shape while the other lies on top), and just stand there while the narrator asks ''Guys?'' - as in give it a try. And finally, Megan gives up and leaves at the suggestion {{w|natural logarithm|ln}}(2{{w|pi|π}}) (or ≈ 1.83787706641) to the frustration of the narrator, who exclaims ''Aww, c'mon''. \n\nThe narrator is so frustrated, as we are told in the title text, because he did not even get to ask them to do a {{w|continued fraction}} (which likely would have involved many other people) as the ultimate challenge.\n\nAn additional line in ''[[xkcd: volume 0]]'' suggests posing to form the definition of the {{w|gamma function}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panels]\n:XKCD PRESENTS\n:a guide to \n:NUMERICAL SEX POSITIONS:\n\n:Narrator: 69\n:[Cueball and Megan perform a standing sixty-nine position i.e. mutual oral sex.]\n\n:Narrator: 99\n:[Cueball and Megan perform a standing spooning position.]\n\n:Narrator: 71\n:[Megan is bent over a table and Cueball takes her doggy-style.]\n\n:Narrator: 34\n:[Cueball looks at Megan, who is standing on one leg with her arms out.]\n:Cueball: Uh.\n\n:Narrator: √<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">8</span>\n:[Cueball and Megan are staring at each other.]\n:Narrator: Guys?\n\n:Narrator: ln(2π)\n:[Cueball just stands there while Megan is walking away.]\n:Narrator: Aww, c'mon...\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Math]]"
