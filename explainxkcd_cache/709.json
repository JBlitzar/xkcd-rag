I'm supposed to find one that speaks Bocce.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nIn the {{w|Book of Exodus}} in the {{w|Hebrew Bible}}, God announces his presence to {{w|Moses}} by way of a {{w|burning bush}}. The quotation in this comic is a combination of [https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html Exodus 3:14] - \"I am that I am\", and [https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-16.html Exodus 3:16] - \"I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.\"\n\nThe punchline comes when God introduces his \"counterpart, {{w|R2-D2}}\", implying that the \"god\" in this case is not actually the {{w|God of the Jews}} as expected, but rather {{w|C-3PO}}, a {{w|Droid (Star Wars)|droid}} from the ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' universe; theoretically, in the mind of the reader, God's voice might humorously go from [https://youtu.be/zUm6rC0o7Po?t=24 booming and sepulchral] in the first frame, to [https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/8d7dcc54-fb0f-4068-a741-c86259cd5112 snooty and British] in the second frame.  It could be a reference to a plot point from ''{{w|Return of the Jedi}}'', in which the [https://youtu.be/rk_HB2Pdk2M Ewoks believe C-3PO is a god].  (In the movie, C-3PO states that it's against his programming to \"impersonate a {{w|deity}}\", but he does so anyway; whether it's actually a violation of his programming is [https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/110974/how-did-c3po-manage-to-impersonate-a-deity-if-it-was-against-his-progamming debatable].)\n\nThe joke is that \"I AM\", the name of God in the Bible, is represented in {{w|Hebrew}} by the {{w|Tetragrammaton}}, YHWH. This abbreviation coincidentally{{Citation needed}} follows the 4-character naming convention of ''Star Wars'' droid characters such as C-3PO and R2-D2 and, like the latter, contains identical characters in the 2nd and 4th positions. (In English translations of the text, this is the part rendered as \"LORD\" in capitals.)\n\nIn the title text, \"LO-M\" refers to the [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/LOM-series_protocol_droid LOM], a model of [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Protocol_droid protocol droid] in the Star Wars universe similar to the [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3PO-series_protocol_droid 3PO] model; \"L-O-M\" sounds like \"{{w|Elohim}}\", a Hebrew word for \"God\".  [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bocce Bocce] refers to a language that [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Owen_Lars Owen Lars] wanted his protocol droid to be able to speak; C-3PO claimed that it was [https://youtu.be/LWPENk8rH7w \"like a second language to me\"].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The Burning Bush of Exodus fame speaks to Moses, who is shielding himself with his arm, as if a great gust of wind is overtaking him.]\n:Bush: I AM THAT I AM, THE '''LORD''' YOUR GOD AND THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, OF ABRAHAM, OF ISAAC, AND OF JACOB.\n:[A droid comes into frame, Moses looks down at it.]\n:Bush: AND THIS IS MY COUNTERPART, R2-D2.\n:''BLEEP BLOOP''\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]"
