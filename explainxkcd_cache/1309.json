'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nInfinite scrolling is a technique in web design where a large data set is displayed as a seemingly infinite list, but in reality only the visible part of the list (and the surrounding data) is rendered. This is done to work around memory limitations of old browsers and mobile devices or to save on data transfer size.\n\nThe problem with this technique is that if you navigate from this page to a different page and go back, the location of the scrolled data set is often lost and the top of the data set is displayed again. Also it is usually not possible to point a URL directly to a certain section of the infinite list, a practice known as {{w|deep linking}}. For these reasons, many prefer {{w|pagination}}, the method traditionally used in books, over infinite scrolling.\n\nIn this comic [[Megan]] is handling the book gingerly as if it were a device with a touchscreen where the book is displayed as an infinite scrolling text. Touching a link would navigate away from the list and the current reading position would be lost.\n\nIn the title text it is an ironic suggestion that the \"back\" button is now useless. The back-button is supposed to give you this functionality but due to the failure to implement continuous scrolling sites and deep-linking correctly they are typically useless when the user is reading infinite-scrolling data (or worse, flat-out counterproductive, giving you the wrong page). Alternatively, this might be a joke on the stereotype that web users are unable to make the most helpful or intelligent decisions, similarly to [[1454: Done]], [[1974: Conversational Dynamics]], and [[2051: Bad Opinions]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands at a desk, reading a book, touching it very gingerly.
