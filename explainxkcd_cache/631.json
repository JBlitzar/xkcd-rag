They only look all formal and professional due to careful cropping.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\n[[Megan]] and a person not shown are {{w|Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Images#Making_images_yourself|taking photos}} of their own anatomy for inclusion in relevant Wikipedia articles. This is one of the few comics where Megan is named, and also one of the few comics to feature speech bubbles. It is revealed that {{tvtropes|PublicExposure|instead of taking these photos at home or in a professional studio}}, they are shooting at a {{w|TGI Friday's}} restaurant.\n\nTGI Friday's is an American multinational restaurant chain known for its casual family-friendly atmosphere, upbeat service, and fried appetizers. Megan's and the person's behavior is of course highly inappropriate, due to the sanitation issues relating to sitting or laying naked on the tables, as well as public decency issues; nudity is illegal in most public places, and this is compounded by the fact that there are usually children in TGI Friday's. \n\nThe message implicit in the comic (and stated outright in the title text) is that careful cropping can produce useful, apparently professional reference images, even if the source photograph was not taken in a professional manner, or was pornographic in nature.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Plate 15: Female breast\n:[There is a drawing of a breast, with 'breast', 'areola', and 'nipple' labeled.]\n\n:Plate 16: External female genitalia\n:[There is a picture of external female genitalia. 'labia majora', 'labia minora', 'clitoris', 'urethral opening', and 'vagina' are labeled.  Voice #1's speech bubble partly covers the middle of the genitalia.]\n:Voice #1: HEY!\n\n:Plate 17: External male genitalia\n:[There is salt, ketchup, and mustard to one side.]\n:Voice #2: Shit!\n:Voice #1: What the hell?  You can't do that in here.\n:Voice #2: Megan, get off the table!\n:Voice #2: Grab the tripod!\n\n:Plate 18: Erect Penis\n:[The picture appears to be at an angle. Megan is running. Voice #1, in the background, is drawn as Cueball.]\n:Voice #1: We're calling the cops!\n:Voice #2: RUN!\n:Voice #1: TGI Friday's is a family establishment!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Penis]]"
