Since Roombas are native to North America, it's illegal for Americans to keep them in their houses under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n{{w|Roomba}} is a brand of domestic cleaning robots manufactured by the company {{w|iRobot}}. The robots are designed to automatically vacuum floors. Although these robots are controlled by a quite simple software without any artificial intelligence, some owners tend to humanize them in the same way that others humanize their pets. There are [[:Category:Roomba|several other comics]] related to a Roomba.\n\n[[Megan]] presents a {{w|pet carrier}} to [[Cueball]] the {{w|veterinarian}} assistant. She says that her \"dog\" is “crawling around eating dirt”, which sounds like certain types of behavioral problems one encounters in dogs, but is precisely what Roombas are made for. (However, the vacuum bag may need to be cleaned.) The vet then comments that it is a Roomba, to which Megan responds that the device (which has nothing to do with an animal) is a cross-breed, and agrees that there probably is “some Roomba” in it. She thus acknowledges the existence of Roombas, but still treats them as if it were an animal. It's common to talk about domestic dogs this way, but cross-breeding dogs with machines is impossible.{{Citation needed}} The vet then goes on to say, with endless patience, that a Roomba is not a pet. This is taken by Megan as if the doctor said that her Roomba-like device is a non-domesticated animal (like a monkey, a fox, or the birds referred to in the title text) that can, but should not, be kept in captivity. In the last panel she consequently releases the vacuum cleaner and it whirs away to its 'freedom'.\n\nThe second customer, [[Hairy]], has his dog on a leash, but is also carrying a pet transporter for the dog. Most likely he has arrived with the dog in the transporter (perhaps using public transportation) but has now taken it out so it can walk for itself, making the carrier much lighter.\n\nThe {{w|Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty act}} from the title text contains a list of over 800 bird species that are not allowed to be captured or killed. If the Roomba were to be classified as a native American bird and were added to the list, keeping them as pets would constitute capturing and would be considered illegal. This, of course, shows how confused Megan is. She previously stated the Roomba to be a dog and now apparently believes it is a bird, even though dogs are not birds{{Citation needed}} and neither is the Roomba.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan arrives with a pet carrier, Cueball stands at a desk as a veterinarian, and Hairy is waiting behind a rope, standing next in line with a dog on a leash and a pet carrier.]\n:Megan: There's something wrong with my dog. He keeps crawling around eating dirt.\n\n:[Cueball takes out the contents of the carrier, revealing a Roomba, and Megan waits for Cueball's input. She is standing behind the desk with the carrier on the desk.]\n:Cueball: This is a Roomba.\n:Megan: Well, he's a mix. \n:Megan: Probably some Roomba in there.\n\n:[The Roomba now lies on the table next to the carrier between the two.]\n:Cueball: A Roomba is not a pet.\n:Megan: You're right. It's wrong to keep a beautiful creature like this in a house.\n\n:[Megan is outside left to a tree, arms up in the air, encouraging the Roomba to drive away.]\n:Megan: Go! \n:Megan: Be free!\n:Roomba: ''Whirrr''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Roomba]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
