It was the second of two [[:Category:New Year|New Year comics]] around the 2019-2020 New Year, after [[2248: New Year's Eve]]. \n\nThe comic opens with [[Megan]], [[Cueball]], [[White Hat]], and [[Ponytail]] celebrating the new year. Ponytail expresses relief  that, they can now unambiguously name the decade \"the 20s\", since the decade has a well-defined name, any cultural trends that begin in the 20s can be attributed to the decade itself, and not to the generation that happens to coincide with it.\n\nPrior to 2000, and particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, eras were often defined by decades, such as discussing the social movements of the 60s, or the music of the 80s. Beginning in 2000, this trend was noticeably reduced, most likely because the first two decades of a century didn't fit into the same naming convention, making it clunkier to discuss. \"{{w|Aughts}}\" and \"Teens\" were names suggested for the {{w|2000s_(decade)|2000s}} and {{w|2010s}} respectively; however, neither of those names managed to gain widespread acceptance.\n\nIn this same era, there was an increased emphasis on generational cohorts, which Ponytail seems to see as a replacement for dividing time into decades. {{w|Millennials}} is a name given to the generation which was born in the 1980s through the mid 1990s. The term is sometimes used pejoratively by older generations who view millennials as immature or complacent, and this was particularly common in the 2010s. It's possible that this focus on the generation was really a substitute for a focus on youth culture of that era. This is particularly notable since, as time moves on, Millenials continue to age, but the older generation still views them as the current youth. This phenomenon was previously discussed in [[1849: Decades]].\n\nWhite Hat, however, raises a pedantic objection to Ponytail's celebration: he believes that the new decade does not properly start until 2021.\n\nPonytail corrects him on this, but he refuses to accept the correction until Megan cites an unlikely source: the fact that the {{w|VH1}} television show ''{{w|I Love the '90s (American TV series)|I Love the '90s}}'' categorized MC Hammer's 1990 single \"{{w|U Can't Touch This}}\" as a 90s song, which supports Ponytail's definition of a decade. The joke is that a pop culture documentary is not an authoritative source for definitions of time standards,{{Citation needed}} yet everyone is willing to immediately accept its authority on such matters anyway. Demonstrating the common usage of language is a valid argument, but the degree to which the authority of a single cable channel resolves the argument is unexpected. \n\nThe disagreement over the definition of when decades start is due to the fact that there is more than one way to count decades. You could do it in one of the following two ways:\n*By counting every span of ten years that has occurred since the start of year 1 in the Common Era (White Hat's definition)\n*By taking the digit that is common to all years in a given ten-year span (Ponytail's definition)\n\nWhite Hat's definition is an \"ordinal\" method since it functions by counting the number of ten-year spans ''since the first one'', which is defined to have begun in the year 1. However, Ponytail's definition is the \"cardinal\" method, which simply groups years by their common most significant digits. For example, when we say \"the 1980s\", we mean \"the span of ten years that all began with the digits 1-9-8\".\n\nBoth definitions are internally consistent, but Ponytail's definition is clearly the more common one. She notes that this is not how decades are typically determined, and the fact that counting centuries in an ordinal way does not require that the same be done for decades. \n\nWhite Hat's objection recalls an issue that was frequently discussed around the year 2000. Like decades, centuries may be counted ordinally (\"20th century\", \"19th century\", etc.) or cardinally (\"1700s\", \"1600s\", etc.). Unlike decades, the ordinal terms are always used for centuries in most languages, including English (except informally). Thus, much of the world celebrated the year 2000 as the start of the 21st century and of the third millennium, even though this was incorrect.\n\nMegan's exclamation \"Stop!\" is similar to the line famously used by MC Hammer in \"U Can't Touch This\" (\"Stop! Hammer time.\").\n\nContinuing the dubious \"proof\" offered by Megan, the title text goes on to use the {{w|Billboard (magazine)|Billboard}} [https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-billboards-top-songs-80s Best of the 80s] chart as proof that the 1980s started in 1980, as their chart includes {{w|Blondie (band)|Blondie's}} \"{{w|Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me}}\", which was released in 1980. The title text ends with {{w|Q.E.D.|QED}} (\"quod erat demonstrandum\"), which means \"which was [necessary] to be shown\", and is traditionally used at the end of a mathematical proof, implicitly equating such pop culture references to unassailable logical evidence.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan walks in from the left greeting Cueball, White Hat, and Ponytail standing next to each other, the last two looking in her direction.]\n:Megan: Happy new decade!\n:Ponytail: Welcome to the '20s!\n:White Hat: '''''Actuallyâ€”'''''\n:Ponytail: I'm excited we can name decades again. \n:Ponytail: \"Aughts\" and \"teens\" never caught on.\n\n:[Megan stops next to Cueball as White Hat has his finger raised.]\n:White Hat: Actually, the new decade doesn't start-\n:Ponytail: Mostly, I'm just glad we can go back to attributing cultural trends to decades instead of generations.\n\n:[All four just stand normal.]\n:Cueball: Yeah.\n:Cueball: Decades were silly, but making everything about \"millennials\" turned out to be even worse.\n:Ponytail: Seriously.\n\n:[Only White Hat and Ponytail are shown, both with their arms held out to the sides, with White Hats's arms more relaxed than Ponytail's.]\n:White Hat: It's technically not a new decade until 2021.\n:Ponytail: OK, listen.\n:Ponytail: If you're going to be pedantic, you should at least be right.\n:White Hat: I '''''am''''' right!\n:Ponytail: You're '''''not'''''.\n\n:[Zoom in on White Hat and Ponytail's upper bodies as they gesture towards each other both raising their hands, palm up. Megan interrupts them from off-panel, as made clear in the next panel. Her voice comes out of a starburst on the left panel frame.]\n:White Hat: See, the 20<sup>th</sup> century didn't start until--\n:Ponytail: But decades aren't centuries. They're not cardinally numbered.\n:White Hat: You don't get it. Let me draw a--\n:Ponytail: No, '''''you''''' don't--\n:Megan (off-panel): Stop!\n\n:[All four characters are displayed again. Megan has raised a finger and all the others look at her.]\n:Megan: I can resolve this.\n:Megan: *Ahem*\n:Megan: MC Hammer's ''U Can't Touch This'' (1990) was featured in '''''I Love the '90s''''', not ''''' '80s'''''.\n:Ponytail: ...That settles that.\n:White Hat: Yeah, I accept VH1's authority.\n:White Hat: You win.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Millennials were also mentioned in [[1962: Generations]] and in [[2165: Millennials]]. Also, [[Randall]] himself is a millennial.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n<!-- Include any categories below this line. -->\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:New Year]]\n[[Category:Pedantic]]"
