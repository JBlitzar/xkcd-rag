He admits to being an asshole, a profanity that describes someone who does things that antagonize, irritate, or anger others (either intentionally or incidentally). While a common example might be someone who weaves in and out of traffic, or someone who parks across two parking spaces, Black Hat is \"more creative.\" This also suggests that, while most people described as assholes are either ignorant or selfish, Black Hat seems to intentionally behave this way strictly to be an asshole and not for any self-benefit. He claims to be a \"classy asshole,\" or as he coins the {{w|portmanteau}}, a \"class-hole.\" He seems to equate creativity with class, although that seems like a leap. In any event, this is another early Black Hat strip that, for the first time, explicitly sets out that he goes out of his way to wreak havoc.\n\nAmong his \"pranks,\" he suggests poking holes in grocery noodle cups. These are pre-packaged cups filled with dried noodles and dried soup mix (either in a separate pouch, or loose in the cup) to which one adds boiling water, which both cooks the pasta and dissolves the soup mix to become the soup/broth. By poking holes in the cup, Black Hat ensures that someone pouring boiling water in the cup would have it leak all over them, causing them great surprise and pain.{{citation needed}}\n\nHe also suggests poking holes in {{w|condoms}}, which could cause even more serious consequences. This form of {{w|Reproductive coercion#Birth control sabotage|contraceptive sabotage}} is a way to cause unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease infection. Sabotage may be by someone acting maliciously at random (such as poking holes at the store pre-purchase) or by one of the participants to attempt to cause a pregnancy when the other partner does not want it, often occurring as part of reproductive abuse.<ref name=ACOG>Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. February 2013\n[https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Health-Care-for-Underserved-Women/Reproductive-and-Sexual-Coercion Committee Opinion No. 554: Reproductive and Sexual Coercion] Obstet Gynecol 2013;121:411â€“5. PMID 23344307</ref> The 2013 movie ''{{w|The Priest's Children}}'' describes a similar campaign.\n\nThe title text explains that the word 'classhole' was first introduced to [[Randall]] (and probably to the world) by a friend of his named Beth. The term was later prominently used in the {{w|Family Guy}} episode {{w|Brian Griffin's House of Payne}}, but since that episode first aired in 2010, this comic (and by extension Beth, presumably) used it before that. Whether the writers of Family Guy derived the word from this comic, heard of it from some other source, or thought of it independently is unknown.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: How did you spend your morning?\n:Black Hat: Feeding rocks to children in the park.\n\n:Cueball: Your sociopathic abuse of random strangers staggers me.\n:Black Hat: I aspire to have more creativity than the common asshole.\n\n:Black Hat: I'm more of a <u>classy</u> asshole -- A class-hole, if you will.
