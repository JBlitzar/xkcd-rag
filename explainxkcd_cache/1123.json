A detailed explanation (for the lay person) of this process is available in this article about [http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/3280.html Making Atoms]. \n\nFrom this article (and from the wiki article on Big Bang) it is clear that our universe began not only with hydrogen. Although the majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, lots of {{w|helium}} and traces of {{w|lithium}} were also produced. Actually {{w|Big Bang#Abundance of primordial elements|about 25%}} of the non-dark mass in the universe comes from helium created shortly after the Big Bang. (See also the later comic [[2723: Outdated Periodic Table]] about which atoms were around after the Big Bang).\n\nIn stars, however, helium is also created directly from hydrogen atoms. So it would have been enough to just start out with hydrogen in the early universe. Given enough time, all the other elements would have been created inside these originally hydrogen-only stars. To make elements heavier than helium some of the elements created by hydrogen, will have to fuse subsequentially. And in order to make elements heavier than iron, a {{w|supernova}} explosion is needed. But in either case it is still products of hydrogen that fuse together.\n\nIn many countries, food products must have their {{w|Nutrition facts label|ingredients displayed}} somewhere on their packaging. Because all the ingredients in any food are either hydrogen or heavier atoms created through stellar nuclear fusion from hydrogen over time, the ingredients of any items can technically be described fully as only being made from hydrogen and time. Thus this label would be the universal label. A pun on two of the meanings of the word [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/universal universal]. Any food is of course ''universal'' as in a part of the universe. But the label can also be a ''universal'' label as in a common label for all food or any other product in the universe, as well as the universe itself for that {{w|matter}}.\n\nThe title text first makes it clear that this works both for any {{w|grocery}} as well as any non-grocery, which as described above simply means anything else. It then goes on to making a pun on the words {{w|thyme}} (a herb) and {{w|time}}, as the two words are {{w|homophones}}. \"H\" is the chemical symbol for hydrogen thus completing the pun by noticing that the word \"thyme\" can be made by adding the letter \"h\" to \"tyme\" which would be a homophone even closer to the word time.\n\n[[Randall]] previously made a joke on the fact that thyme and time are homophones in [[282: Organic Fuel]].\n\nLater he made a reference to primordial hydrogen in the title text of [[2778: Cuisine]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''Ingredients:'''\n:Hydrogen, Time\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Time]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
