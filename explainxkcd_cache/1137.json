In the comic, [[Black Hat]] tires of [[Cueball]]'s complaining and inserts a U+202e character in the middle of Cueball's speech, turning his complaints into gibberish - sentences that must be read from right-to-left. \n\nThe title of the comic builds on this theme, with the title of the webpage it is hosted on being LTR in some browsers (see [[#Trivia|trivia]]), the reverse of the comic name.\n\nWhat Cueball actually tries to say after Black Hat's change is:\n:— They didn't even...\n:...What the hell?\n:How did you...\n:...Asshole.\n\nWhen multiple writers work on the same text, arguments can often arise with some writers resorting to vandalizing the works of other writers. The title text takes this up a level, suggesting the use of U+202e and other direction control characters in editor wars to disrupt other people's work. \n\nIf you ever get involved in such a war, note that U+202a returns text back to its normal direction.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing behind Black Hat who is sitting down with a laptop on his lap.]\n:Cueball: And that's not even the worst part! The ''worst'' part is that—\n:Black Hat types a command on the PC: U+202e\n:Cueball: &#x202E;—they didn't even...&#x202D;\n:Cueball: &#x202E;...what the hell?&#x202D;\n:Cueball: &#x202E;How did you...&#x202D;\n:Cueball: &#x202E;...asshole.&#x202D;\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the version originally published there was a typo in the reverse text (\"ETH\" instead of \"EHT\" for \"THE\"). This mistake was corrected within a couple of hours.\n*The title given in the web browser, (for instance seen on the icon for the browser bar at the bottom of the screen), for the comic on the xkcd website actually has a U+202e character preceding it; \n**The page title is \"xkcd: [U+202e]LTR\", which for instance causes {{w|Firefox}} to write the page title as \"xkcd: xoferiF allizoM - RTL\" as the window title. So xkcd and the comics title is correct (The LTR turns to RTL). But the browsers name is reversed.\n**It is known to also occur in {{w|Internet Explorer}}, {{w|Microsoft Edge}}, {{w|Chromium (web browser)|anything based on Chromium}}, {{w|Opera (web browser)|Opera}} and {{w|Maxthon}}.\n**In some browsers (for instance Internet Explorer), this page's title [[Media:Reverse archive.jpg|damages the appearance of all older entries]] in the [http://xkcd.com/archive/ archive page] on xkcd. \n*This is the second comic in a row with Cueball and Black Hat discussing. Both with Black Hat with his back turned to Cueball. \n**In the previous comic Black Hat broke a mirror, and in this comic he then reverses Cueball's speech\n**Not exactly a mirroring of his speech, but still related.\n**In the broken archive mentioned above, [[1136: Broken Mirror]] is the first (or last) entry to be broken!\n\n==Unicode Control Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Unicode number !! Name !! Meaning\n|-\n| U+202a || LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING || The following text will be left-to-right. This will not change directionality of characters, so for example Arabic letters will stay right-to-left. This character alone does nothing in an English text, since the text direction is left-to-right by default.\n|-\n| U+202b || RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING || The following text will be right-to-left. This will not change directionality of characters, so Latin letters will stay left-to-right. Full stops, which don't have a directionality on their own, will be left of the sentence. Use this character for some little misplacings that cause big confusion.\n|-\n| U+202c || POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING || The following text is formatted like the text before the last U+202a, U+202b, U+202d or U+202e character.\n|-\n| U+202d || LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE || The following text will be left-to-right. Additionally, the directionality of characters is changed to left-to-right. Used alone in an English text, this will only affect characters that are right-to-left by default, like Arabic letters.\n|-\n| U+202e || RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE || The following text will be right-to-left. Additionally, the directionality of characters is changed to right-to-left. Use this character to completely screw up an English text.\n|}\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Computers]]\n[[Category:Unicode]]"
