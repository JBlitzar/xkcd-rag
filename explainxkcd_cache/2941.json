Actual cell components include the nucleus, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus, while unrelated concepts come from geology, engineering, antivirus software, and even Star Wars. Labels like \"evil endoplasmic reticulum\" and \"sticky endoplasmic reticulum\" are variations of real cellular organelles. Other labels like \"pith,\" \"mantle,\" and \"Vitreous humor,\" are borrowed from other types of circular cross-sectional diagrams (e.g., of fruit, planets, and eyeballs).\n\nThe title text is a fictional backstory to the {{w|Golgi apparatus}}, an essential cell organelle involved in processing and packaging proteins. It suggests that {{w|Camillo Golgi}}, the scientist who discovered the Golgi apparatus, was originally an independent organism that was supposedly absorbed into our cells, where it then started working on what is now known as the Golgi apparatus. The joke is a satirical take on {{w|Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic theory}}, which posits that certain organelles within {{w|Eukaryote|eukaryotic}} cells, like {{w|mitochondria}} and {{w|chloroplasts}}, originated from independent symbiotic {{w|Prokaryote|prokaryotic organisms}} that were absorbed by a host {{w|germ cell}}. Golgi is drawn in the comic as a cute little alien.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Label\n! Meaning\n! Exists?\n! Cell organelle?\n! Explanation\n|-\n| {{w|Smooth endoplasmic reticulum}}\n| A network of tubular membranes within the cytoplasm of the cell, involved in the transport of materials.\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| An {{w|endoplasmic reticulum}} is considered \"smooth\" if it is not covered in ribosomes.\n|-\n| {{w|Lithosphere}}\n| The rigid outer part of the earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Term from geology; part of the Earth's crust. Labeled cross-sectional diagrams of cells and of the layers of the Earth are commonly found in science textbooks.\n|-\n| {{w|O-ring}}\n| A mechanical gasket in the shape of a torus; used to seal connections.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Engineering term. Both the o-ring and pith are drawn connected to the inner cell membrane. Made famous in pop culture for being the root cause of the {{w|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster}}.\n|-\n| {{w|Pith}}\n| The central tissue in plants, used for nutrient transport.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Botanical term. Most people think of pith as the layer of soft tissue between the skin and the flesh of citrus fruit, which explains its position in the diagram. Both the pith and o-ring are drawn connected to the inner cell membrane. A layer of pith was recently seen only 101 comics ago, in [[2840: Earth Layers]].\n|-\n| {{w|Cell nucleus|Nucleus}}\n| The central and most important part of an object, forming the basis for its activity and growth.\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| The cell nucleus is an actual cell organelle which houses {{w|DNA}}.\n|-\n| {{w|Nucleolus}}\n| A small dense spherical structure in the nucleus of a cell during {{w|interphase}}.\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Actual cell organelle, involved in {{w|ribosome}} production.\n|-\n| Nucleoloulous\n| Not a real term, albeit a portmanteau of the aforementioned \"Nucleus\" and \"Nucleolus\" words\n| No\n| No\n| A humorous continuation of the terms \"nucleus\" and \"nucleolus\"; as the nucleolus does have internal components (such as the fibrillar center). Still, none of the nucleolus's components go by the name \"Nucleoloulous\"...\n|-\n| {{w|Nucleon}}s\n| Protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.\n| Yes\n| No\n| While cells contain matter which is supposed to contain nucleons,{{Citation needed}} yet the depicted circles are far larger than actual nucleons.\n|-\n| Drain plug\n| A stopper for a drain.\n| Yes\n| No\n| A plumbing term, which could refer to a {{w|porosome}}. Even small, temporary damage to the integrity of the {{w|cell membrane}} puts the cell at immediate and great risk of death.\n|-\n| Evil endoplasmic reticulum\n| Not a real term.\n| No\n| No\n| The rough endoplasmic reticulum is covered in ribosomes; the \"evil\" endoplasmic reticulum in the comic is covered in small spikes, making it evil.\n|-\n| {{w|Hypoallergenic}} filling\n| Materials that cause relatively fewer allergic reactions.\n| Yes\n| [[Technically]] not incorrect\n| Consumer product term, used e.g. for pillows and mattresses. If the {{w|cytoplasm}} doesn't cause allergic reactions within the cell, it is hypoallergenic.\n|-\n| Weak spot\n| A vulnerable point.\n| Yes\n| Conceivably\n| {{w|Cell membrane}} surfaces do indeed vary in strength, often due to the presence of organelles such as {{w|ion channel pore}}s or {{w|porosome}}s, both of which can be leveraged by viruses to enter cells.\n|-\n| {{w|Mitochondria}}\n| Organelles that generate energy for the cell.\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Actual cell organelles. Mitochondria are widely known as the \"powerhouse of the cell,\" a phrase originally coined in 1957 by biologist {{w|Philip Siekevitz}}[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/powerhouse-of-the-cell/] which came to prominence online in the mid-2010s.{{acn}}\n|-\n| {{w|Midichlorians}}\n| Fictional microorganisms in the {{w|Star Wars}} universe, which confer Force sensitivity and thereby associated {{w|Jedi}} (and Sith)  powers.\n| No\n| Fictional\n| It's unclear whether {{w|George Lucas}} intended for \"midi-chlorians\" to be {{w|Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic organelles}} or internal {{w|Symbiosis|symbionts}}.\n|-\n| {{w|Chloroplast}}s if you're lucky\n| Organelles in plant cells responsible for {{w|photosynthesis}}.\n| Yes\n| Yes, but in plants and plantlike organisms\n| Actual cell organelles, found in plant cells and those of several different lineages of non-plant microorganisms and seaweeds. The phrase \"if you're lucky\" alludes to the good fortune that an organism, be it plant, animal, or microbe, gains by being able to photosynthesize, getting energy from sunlight, rather than have to run around all the time chasing energy. This benefit makes chloroplasts {{w|Kleptoplasty|worth stealing}}. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05499-y Experiments have been conducted] to transplant components of chloroplasts into mammal cells to slow disease. See also [https://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1978/06/26 Zonker Harris].\n|-\n| Human skin\n| The outer covering of the human body.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Skin is a {{w|Tissue_(biology)|tissue}} (multicellular structure). The idea that a complex tissue can be wrapped around a single cell, as if it were a cell wall, or outer {{w|cell membrane}}, or {{w|extracellular matrix}}, is humorously backwards: human skin is made of cells, not the other way around.\n|-\n| {{w|Carbonation}}\n| {{w|Carbon dioxide}} dissolved in a liquid.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Carbonation causes soda pop and similar liquids to bubble, fizz, foam, and {{w|effervesce}}. The little dots depicted in the comic look like carbonation bubbles.\n|-\n| Golgi\n| {{w|Camillo Golgi}} (1843â€“1926) was an Italian biologist and {{w|pathologist}} who discovered the Golgi apparatus; known also for his works on the central nervous system.\n| Yes\n| No\n| The real Golgi was not and is not a tiny alien being who merged with our cells,{{Citation needed}} as the comic and title text imply. While the mitochondria and chloroplast may have been evolved in such a manner (through being consumed by a host cell), this is not considered the case for the Golgi apparatus.\n|-\n| {{w|Golgi apparatus}}\n| A complex of {{w|vesicles}} and folded membranes involved in secretion and intracellular transport.\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Actual cell organelle, which takes {{w|polypeptide}} chains from the rough endoplasmic reticulum via transport vesicles and processes them into their protein structure before sending them (again via vesicles) to their destination such as an organelle or outside of the cell.\n|-\n| {{w|Norton AntiVirus}}\n| A software product designed to protect computers from malware.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Viruses do attempt to insert themselves into cells, and many cell types do have antiviral mechanisms (notably the {{w|CRISPR}} (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) DNA sequences in prokaryotes, which resist viral (bacteriophage) infection - however, the cell shown is not prokaryotic, since it contains a nucleus). A system designed to protect against computer viruses is unlikely to be helpful, though, since biological viruses are completely different, and cells have not been architected to support such software. \n|-\n| Sticky endoplasmic reticulum\n| Not a real term, although parts of the reticula have sticky pockets.[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1156152/full]\n| No\n| No\n| Another humorous twist on the actual types of endoplasmic reticula.\n|-\n| {{w|Pleiades}}\n| A cluster of stars in the constellation Taurus.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Even a single star is far too big to fit in a cell.{{Citation needed}} The labeled cluster in the comic looks like the actual constellation, as if this were a depiction of the night sky.\n|-\n| Natural flavor\n| Flavoring derived from natural sources.\n| Yes\n| Conceivably\n| A common ingredient on food labels (and sometimes cosmetics, etc.), usually meaning any substance to add flavor, aroma, or both, other than synthetic chemicals which are referred to as artificial flavors.\n|-\n| {{w|Cellophane}}\n| A thin, transparent sheet made of regenerated {{w|cellulose}}.\n| Yes\n| No\n| A type of packaging material. A {{w|cell wall}} is indeed made of cellulose, though not in the form of cellophane. Also, this drawing looks more like an animal cell (albeit a very odd one), which unlike plants and fungi, do not usually have a cell wall.\n|-\n| {{w|Rough endoplasmic reticulum}}\n| Endoplasmic reticulum with {{w|ribosomes}} attached, involved in protein synthesis.\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Actual cell organelle. \"Rough\" refers to the presence of ribosomes covering its membrane, which translate {{w|messenger RNA}} into polypeptide chains. Normally the endoplasmic reticulum would wrap around the cell nucleus (as the nuclear envelope is itself a specialized part of the rough endoplasmic reticulum).\n|-\n| {{w|Ventricle}}\n| A chamber of the heart that pumps blood out.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Ventricles are actually part of the body, and they are composed of many cells. Possibly a pun on {{w|vesicle}} (or {{w|vacuole}}), a small membrane-enclosed vessel, such as the transport vesicles that carry polypeptides from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus for processing.\n|-\n| {{w|Mantle}} <!-- intentionally left linking to disambiguation page -->\n| The layer of the earth between the crust and the core.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Misplaced geological term with many other meanings. Labeled cross-sectional diagrams of the layers of the Earth are commonly found in science textbooks.\n|-\n| {{w|Slime}}\n| A moist, soft, and slippery substance, or a brand name for a {{w|Slime_(toy)|goopy substance sold as a toy}}.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Could refer to the slimy texture and appearance of {{w|cytoplasm}}, but not specific to cells. Slime was a frequent appearance on the Nickelodeon TV kids channel during [[Randall]]'s youth in the 90s (a signature aspect of the network, it was introduced when Nickelodeon became the American home of the Canadian kids' show {{w|You Can't Do That on Television}}, which had a running gag of dumping green slime on anyone who said \"I don't know\").\n|-\n| {{w|Vitreous humour}}\n| The clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina in the eyeball.\n| Yes\n| No\n| The vitreous humour is in the eye's {{w|extracellular matrix}}, not inside cells. Labeled cross-sectional diagrams of eyes are also commonly found in science textbooks.\n|-\n| {{w|Seed}}s\n| Plant embryos used for reproduction.\n| Yes\n| No\n| Seeds are multicellular, and sometimes contain small proportions of non-cellular tissue. Cells are found in seeds, not the other way around. Seeds would be labeled on a cross-sectional diagram of a fruit, not a cell.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\nCell Organelles\n[A cell is shown with the following structures and areas labeled, counter-clockwise from upper left:]\n\n* Smooth endoplasmic reticulum\n* Lithosphere\n* O-Ring\n* Pith\n* Nucleus\n* Nucleolus\n* Nucleoloulous\n* Nucleons\n* Drain plug\n* Evil endoplasmic reticulum\n* Hypoallergenic filling\n* Weak spot\n* Mitochondria\n* Midichlorians\n* Chloroplasts if you're lucky\n* Human skin\n* Carbonation\n* Golgi\n* Golgi apparatus\n* Norton AntiVirus\n* Sticky endoplasmic reticulum\n* Pleiades\n* Natural flavor\n* Cellophane\n* Rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\n[These labels are inside the cell:]\n\n* Ventricle\n* Mantle\n* Slime\n* Vitreous humour\n* Seeds\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Biology]]"
