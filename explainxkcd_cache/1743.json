Man, these things are EXPENSIVE.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\nIn this comic [[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] are anticipating guests.  Offering {{w|coffee}} to house guests is a commonly-accepted courtesy in the United States (and most of the western world [and rest of the world {except where people serve tea}]). However, they seem to be unaware of the basics of {{w|Coffee_preparation|coffee making}}. Cueball is concerned that this lack of knowledge is an indication of their mutual immaturity (thinking of himself as a \"fake adult\"). \n\nThis comic thus follows a frequently used theme of people growing up but finding themselves unable or unwilling to accept traditional adult roles (see [[150: Grownups]], [[441: Babies]], [[616: Lease]], [[905: Homeownership]] and [[1674: Adult]]). While there are cultures where coffee is served to children, it is generally seen in the United States (and western world [and rest of the world {especially where people serve tea}]) as an adult beverage&mdash;like {{w|beer}} which has also served as the subject in the comic [[1534: Beer]].\n\nMegan is, however, confident that the necessary steps can be determined. The steps she follows however are quite unorthodox...\n\nShe attempts to make coffee by pouring the ingredients on the ground (misinterpreting the meaning of \"ground coffee\"), sucking it up with a {{w|Dyson (company)|Dyson}} {{w|vacuum cleaner}} (misinterpreting the meaning of \"{{w|Vacuum coffee maker|vacuum brewing}}\"), then boiling the mixture by placing the vacuum cleaner's removable plastic canister over a hot stove, and pouring the resulting sludge through the vacuum-cleaner filter (instead of a standard {{w|coffee filter}}).\n\nMegan says she is a regular \"Starbuck\" after pouring the batch of coffee, believing the name of the cafe chain {{w|Starbucks}} to be synonymous with the actual job title \"{{w|barista}}\", further indicating a general lack of knowledge regarding the subject of coffee. The Starbucks coffee chain was loosely {{w|Starbucks#1970s|named after}} the fictional character {{w|List_of_Moby-Dick_characters#Mates|Starbuck}} from the book {{w|Moby Dick}}, so she could be referring to this, although Starbuck had nothing to do with coffee brewing! The third possible interpretation is that Megan is unaware of the reason for Starbucks' naming and thought that it was the possessive \"Starbuck's\" and that the founder was named Starbuck. See more [[#Trivia|trivia about Starbuck]] below. A fourth interpretation could be that Megan is a regular Starbucks customer and has watched the baristas prepare her coffee, which makes sense considering the fact that she probably has not made coffee much. If this is the case, it could be a direct jab at Starbucks, suggesting their coffee has a quality similar to that of coffee made on the floor.\n\nThis method of making coffee would be very expensive as it would most likely destroy the vacuum-cleaner canister and filter. If the vacuum cleaner had ever been used, then it would not be very hygienic either, although if it had not been used then the floor would probably also be very unhygienic anyway. Since the plastic from the canister has probably also gone into contact with the sludge after being heated over open fire, there is a high risk that this \"coffee\" is actually poisonous for more than one reason.\n\nThe title text refers to the expense of replacing the \"filter\", as vacuum-cleaner filters are considerably more costly than single-use coffee filters. \n\nThis was the first of two comics in a row about food, the next being [[1744: Metabolism]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are talking.]\n:Cueball: We should make coffee for our guests.\n:Megan: Crap. I know nothing about coffee.\n:Cueball: We're basically fake adults.\n:Megan: Don't panic. We can figure this out.\n\n:[Megan shakes a can of coffee grounds out on the floor as Cueball watches.]\n:Megan: We just pour the coffee grounds...\n\n:[Pan to only Megan who pours a pail of water over the grounds now lying in a pile on the floor.]\n:Megan: ...Add water...\n\n:[Cueball watches as Megan vacuums up the mixture on the floor with a bag-less vacuum cleaner, the wire going off panel right behind her.]\n:Vacuum cleaner: ''Vrrrr''\n\n:[Megan is holding the dirt canister from the vacuum cleaner over two lit gas burners on a stove. The canister free vacuum cleaner is standing behind her and Cueball is behind this watching her.]\n:Megan: Now we just hold it over the burners...\n:Burners: ''Hissss''\n\n:[Megan is holding the dirt canister over one shoulder while pouring the hot content into a small mug, as Cueball watches. Three wiggly lines above the liquid indicates that it is hot.]\n:Megan: Annnd... serve.\n:Cueball: Nice!\n:Megan: I'm a regular Starbuck!\n\n==Trivia==\n*In fiction, \"Starbuck\" is also the name of\n**A male character in the {{w|Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original Battlestar Galactica television show}}.\n**A female character in the {{w|Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|reboot of Battlestar Galactica}}.  \n*In real life, {{w|Starbuck Island}} is an island in the Pacific Ocean.  \n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
