Now, he has to say ''ridicu-fucking-lous'', which sounds, well, ridicu-fucking... wait.\n\nThis is an example of {{w|tmesis}}, the breaking up of a word to include another within it, and more specifically of {{w|expletive infixation}}. Normally, for rhythmic reasons the included word is inserted before the {{w|Stress (linguistics)|stressed}} syllable (''ri'''dic'''ulous'' becoming ''ri-fucking-'''dic'''ulous'') which is what Cueball messed up. However, in some cases it is also possible to break the word after a prefix instead, so for some words there are two ways to do it e.g. {{w|wikt:unbefuckinglievable|unbe-fucking-'''lie'''vable}} (before the stressed syllable) or {{w|wikt:unfuckingbelievable|un-fucking-be'''lie'''vable}}; this is because ''unbelievable'' is a combination of ''un'' and ''believable'' to negate ''believable'' which is an actual English word{{Citation needed}} and therefore it still sounds good.\n\nThe title text introduces a further example, with speaker inserting the ''fucking'' too late into the word ''absolutely''—which would have resulted in ''absolute-fucking-ly''—but leaving the word unfinished when they realize their mistake. The more usual tmesis here would be {{w|wikt:absofuckinglutely|''abso-fucking-lutely''}}. Furthermore, the speaker could be also accidentally insulting the person they're speaking to, calling them an \"absolute fucking shit.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing next to Megan.]\n:Cueball: Man, that is '''''ridicu'''''-fucking—... ...Hang on, I inserted \"fucking\" too late and now there's just one awkward syllable left. Can I back up?\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Language]]"
