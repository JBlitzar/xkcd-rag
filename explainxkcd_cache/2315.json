Trying to avoid work, Cueball points out that the {{w|second law of thermodynamics}} itself \"guarantees eventual consistency\", as the {{w|universe}} is ''guaranteed'' to ''eventually'' die a {{w|Heat death of the universe|heat death}}, at maximum {{w|entropy}} and perfect ''consistency''. His boss responds that in a system that has reached maximum entropy, no {{w|work}} can be performed (as this requires a difference in energy states between two sources).  Cueball claims that he's simply getting a head start on this.\n\n''Eventual consistency'' has a double meaning here.  In computing, many systems are ''{{w|distributed computing|distributed}}'' (spread out) across multiple servers, sometimes in very different parts of the world.  When data changes -- like the number of views on a video or the likes on a social media post -- updating it across ''every'' server can be a challenge, and it's often not necessary to keep the data perfectly in sync everywhere.  So the system will use {{w|eventual consistency}} instead.  Each individual server will record changes, and after a certain amount of time or a certain amount of change, the results will be synced across the whole network.  At any given moment, an individual server's data will be a little off -- but ''eventually'' everything will get recorded correctly.\n\nThe title text constitutes another play on the words \"heat bath\", which can refer to the thermally uniform state of the universe at {{w|heat death}}. However, in this context, we can assume Cueball instead plans to prepare a literal warm bath for his own relaxation and enjoyment after or during (or instead of) his work.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a home desk.]\n:Laptop: I know it's hard to focus right now, but we should try to finish testing the DB.\n:Cueball: ''Ughhhh.''\n:Cueball: Okay.\n\n:[A frameless panel. Cueball still sitting at his desk. He has his hand on his chin.]\n:Laptop: The system needs to guarantee eventual consistency.\n:Cueball: I mean, it does.\n\n:[Closeup of Cueball.]\n:Cueball: Eventual consistency is guaranteed by the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\n:Cueball: Sooner or later this will all be a uniform heat bath.\n:Cueball: Maximum entropy.\n\n:[Back to Cueball and desk.  Cueball is leaning back in his chair.]\n:Laptop: Maximum entropy means no useful work can be done!\n:Cueball: I'm getting a head start by doing no useful work ''now''.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Randall has previously invoked the second law of thermodynamics (indirectly) to provide a \"big picture\" solution to the {{w|halting problem}} in [[1266: Halting Problem]], concluding that (in the real world, rather than the case of the ideal infinite {{w|Turing machine}}) all programs do halt...eventually.\n* In [[2282: Coronavirus Worries]], Randall asserted that worrying about \"whether you're getting enough work done\" is common but not very healthy.  Evidently Cueball has taken his advice to heart, but Cueball's boss has not.\n* A new [[Header text#2020-06-03_-_Black_Lives_Matter|header text (Black Lives Matter)]] appeared earlier on the day that this comic debuted.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Programming]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
