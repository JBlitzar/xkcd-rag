Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\nThis comic depicts a {{w|diploma}} for a {{w|Doctor of Philosophy|PhD}} in {{w|forgery|Document Forgery}}. While the diploma looks official at a glance, a closer inspection reveals that the diploma is offered from an exceedingly generic \"East State University\". Normally, colleges or universities with the word 'state' in them are named after the state or region they're in, although this is not always the case. Either way, East State University does not exist anywhere in the world, with the closest being {{w|East Tennessee State University}}.\n\nUpon completion of many awards and educational programs, a physical certificate is presented to the awardee to symbolize their achievement. Creating such a document is generally significantly easier than the underlying accomplishment, and in some cases people will simply buy or create a replica of an official one and take the credit fraudulently. However, the caption claims that if one were able to forge the document shown to a high enough quality that it could be hung in an office without attracting attention, one would have earned it: that is, the creation of such a credible-looking document without drawing any suspicion would show PhD-worthy skills in forgery and thus be deserving of a real diploma. Paradoxically, if someone were able to do this, it would lend some credence to the authenticity of the document.\n\nThe title text mentions that the diploma comes with a {{w|certificate of authenticity}}. However, since the entire reason for questioning the authenticity of the diploma is because of the subject matter being ''forgery'', the certificate's own authenticity is also somewhat questionable. To remedy this, the certificate comes with its own certificate of authenticity, which also comes with a certificate of authenticity, and so on, {{w|ad infinitum}}. Of course, all of the certificates would be equally likely be forged, and they really only show that the forger has {{w|Zeno's paradoxes#Zeno behaviour|a lot of time on their hands}}. Many important and legally binding documents lack any certificate of authenticity, but instead have something stronger, like the backing of a recognized and independent witnessing organization or registry which can confirm the truth when the authenticity of the document is in doubt.\n\n[[Randall]] may have intended a pun on two meanings of the word 'doctor': firstly, as a title accorded to those who have earned a PhD, and secondly as meaning to {{wiktionary|doctor#Verb|change or falsify details on a document (verb #6)}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[A panel depicts a diploma that has decorations on the corners and sides, but the corners have more.
