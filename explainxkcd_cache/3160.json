This is almost always true of colleges and universities, and having a diploma hanging on your wall is a way to signal your academic achievements to anyone who sees them. In an earlier era, such diplomas acted as actual documentation to prove a person's qualifications. In modern times, the actual diploma is typically considered to be decorative. Employers and other organizations confirming a person's education are more likely to contact the institution itself, rather than asking to see a diploma. \n\nHaving a diploma such as the one in the comic would automatically be suspect, because the holder is declaring that they have the skills to forge a diploma, rather than bothering to actually earn the degree. This is backed up by the diploma coming from a school with the exceedingly generic name of \"East State University\". Typically (though not always), colleges or universities with the word 'state' in them are named after the state or region they're in. East State University does not exist anywhere in the world, with the closest being {{w|East Tennessee State University}}. It sounds like something that someone would come up with if they were trying to make up a plausible-sounding name for a fictional school.\n\nThe paradox is that creating a convincing diploma could act as evidence that you are, in fact, trained in the art of forgery. One could even imagine the final exam in such a program including the creation of one's own diploma. None of that applies in real life. No accredited university offers a degree in document forgery, let alone a PhD. Document forgery typically belongs to the field of either crime or spycraft, and in both cases, the training is likely to be unofficial and done without public recognition. Possibly, this might be the creation of someone who felt slighted that their skill in forgery wasn't publicly recognized, and so used their skills to create a fraudulent diploma.\n\nThe title text mentions that the diploma comes with a {{w|certificate of authenticity}}, and that the certificate of authenticity has a certificate of its own, and implies that the second certificate has one of its own, and so on, {{w|ad infinitum}}. The joke is that a certificate of authenticity, on its own, is useless in proving a document wasn't forged because, presumably, forging such a certificate is no more difficult than forging the initial document, and simply recursively adding certificates does nothing to resolve this. In real life, certificates of authenticity are meaningful, because they can be verified with whatever expert or organization issued them. If that party is trusted to be able to detect forgeries, and is able to confirm that they issued the certificate, then that does enable verification of the original document.\n\n[[Randall]] may have intended a pun on two meanings of the word 'doctor': firstly, as a title accorded to those who have earned a PhD, and secondly as meaning to {{wiktionary|doctor#Verb|change or falsify details on a document (verb #6)}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n:[A panel depicts a diploma that has decorations on the corners and sides, but the corners have more.
