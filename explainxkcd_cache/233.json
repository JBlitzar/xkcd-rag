It asks the subject if it felt sad. If the subject is human, then they most likely will have felt sad, so the answer will be \"yes.\" If it's a computer program, however, it is supposed to answer \"no,\" because computer programs cannot feel. This CAPTCHA would be extremely easy to break, however, because a computer could easily find the \"yes\" button and press it. However, the \"trap\" is that a computer program doesn't \"know\" that it's supposed to answer \"yes,\" as it lacks human emotion and empathy. It is similar to the way that humans are very good at being shown simple drawings of an object or an action and being able to tell immediately what it is, while computers can't. The \"no lying\" instruction is ostensibly meant to patch that hole, but unfortunately, it turns out that spambots are not generally programmed with the Three Laws of Robotics.\n\nThis is also a reference to a common remark after watching a film or other production with sad parts -- \"If you didn't cry at [X], you're not human\".\n\nAnother reason why a CAPTCHA like this won't be very practical is that some humans haven't necessarily seen the movie in the question and would be unable to know if they did feel sad or not. For all they know, Littlefoot's mother could be a terrible person about whose death they should be happy or at least relieved.\n\nThe title text references the ''{{w|Futurama}}'' episode \"{{w|Jurassic Bark}}\". It claims that this episode is so sad that even {{w|spambot}}s cry after seeing it.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[In a single panel, the following text is shown:]\n:To complete your web registration, please prove that you're human:\n:::When Littlefoot's mother died in the original 'Land Before Time', did you feel sad?\n:[Radio button:] Yes\n:[Radio button:] No\n:(Bots: no lying)\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category: CAPTCHA]]"
