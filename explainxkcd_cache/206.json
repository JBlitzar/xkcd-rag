Now, I don't mean to pry.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic starts with a line from the song {{w|Folsom Prison Blues|\"Folsom Prison Blues\"}} by Johnny Cash. Cash is noted as saying, \"I sat with my pen in my hand, trying to think up the worst reason a person could have for killing another person, and that's what came to mind,\" which fits pretty well with the personality of [[Black Hat]]. Rather than react badly, [[Cueball]] starts a rhyming game, which they continue until Black Hat refers to the horrifying {{w|My Lai Massacre}}, which is apparently going too far for Cueball.\n\n;You know, I once shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.\n:Black Hat starts with the original line from the song.\n\n;Really? Well I once shot a man in Reno but I couldn't tell you why.\n:Cueball then begins the rhyming game by saying that he can't tell the reason why he killed the man.\n\n;I once shot a man in Reno then I went home to cry.\n:Black Hat continues by saying that he got emotional after killing the man... Unlikely, given that he's ''Black Hat'', and it could be him trying to continue, or he could be being sarcastic.\n\n;I once shot a man in Reno then I watered his cacti.\n:An unlikely action after you have just killed someone, unless you're elaborately trying to cover up your actions. More likely, Cueball is just trying to continue the rhyme.\n\n;I once shot a man in Reno 'cause they cancelled Firefly.\n:{{w|Firefly (TV series)|Firefly}} was a TV series that aired on Fox during 2002. Its cancellation was a source of much annoyance to its fans, a fact frequently referenced in xkcd. In this case, Black Hat goes as far as to murder someone for this.\n\n;I once shot a man in Reno, him and all his succubi.\n:Cueball says he shot a man and all the succubi that he owned/was attached to (\"his succubi\"). A {{w|succubus}} is a demon or spirit which seduces men via sexual intercourse and subsists off their semen, though it is also used euphemistically for promiscuous (human) women or prostitutes (in fact, this was the word's origin in ancient Latin).\n\n;I once shot a man in Reno and a bunch more in My Lai.\n:The {{w|My Lai massacre}} was an atrocity committed by US soldiers in Vietnam during the Vietnam war, which resulted in between 347 - 504 civilian deaths, almost all being women, children, and elderly men. Here, Black Hat says he not only shot a man in Reno, '''he shot a bunch more in My Lai''', meaning that he was actually a perpetrator of the massacre. Cueball is obviously horrified by this, and he ends the rhyme with a \"I think we're done,\" signifying his horror at Black Hat's words.\n\nThe title text continues the rhyme, but changes the roles: now the speaker is asking someone else if they shot a man in Reno. It may be a reference to The Princess Bride (Inigo says the \"I don't mean to pry\" part to Westley).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Black Hat stand facing one another. Black Hat is on the left.]\n:Black Hat: You know, I once shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.\n:Cueball: Really? Well, I once shot a man in Reno, but I couldn't tell you why.\n\n:Black Hat: I once shot a man in Reno, then I went home to cry.\n:Cueball: I once shot a man in Reno, then I watered his cacti.\n\n:Black Hat: I once shot a man in Reno 'cause they cancelled Firefly.\n:Cueball: I once shot a man in Reno, him and all his succubi.\n\n:Black Hat: I once shot a man in Reno and a bunch more in My Lai.\n:Cueball: I think we're done.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Firefly]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Rhymes]]\n[[Category:Demons]]"
