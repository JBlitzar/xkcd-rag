Users swipe right for matches that they like, and left otherwise. The purpose of the app is to get dates, with the intent of a romantic relationship or sexual intercourse. However, in the comic, [[Cueball]] is trying to use it to primarily attract someone capable of flying a plane instead. If the request is genuine (and not just a foible), this is a bad situation, because it suggests Cueball is in charge of a plane that he is unable to fly, and unless he finds a match with someone who can (and is able to provide assistance) the plane will crash. Even then, unless the matched person happens to be on board, and therefore able to assist directly, providing help through Tinder messages is unlikely to be a sufficiently efficient way of solving the problem.{{Citation needed}}\n\nAlternatively, Cueball may simply be pretending that there is an emergency so that he can get matches on Tinder. In either case, depending on the jurisdiction, Cueball may be violating the law by using a cell phone that is not in \"airplane mode\" (in some phones, \"flight mode\" or \"offline mode\") when on an airplane. WiFi can be enabled on some flights during the entire flight; in others it may be banned during takeoff and landing. Even if he is either uploading the picture after the flight or using the in-flight internet service, he is still violating other, more serious laws (if he is a pilot, he may be liable for negligence, and if he is an ordinary passenger, God knows what he may have done...)\n\nThe title text explains that Cueball's unwise method for getting help stems from astonishingly skewed priorities and no small amount of selfishness. He claims to strongly dislike conversing over audio-only channels, and this dislike is apparently so overwhelming that he would rather jeopardize his life and that of any passengers on the plane, than put aside his own hang-ups. Even if we give Cueball the benefit of the doubt and assume that he has a phobia of public speaking, most human beings tend to automatically suspend their irrational anxieties when experiencing the fear of imminent mortal peril, at least until after the danger has passed. For example, those normally afraid of dating Cueball would \"match\" with him to prevent a plane crash, which may be his secret intent after all.\n\nRandall may be satirizing people who use Tinder (and other similar social apps) by portraying an extreme caricature of a Tinder user.\n\nThis comic is similar to [[1897: Self Driving]], and as well as [[582: Brakes]], which also is about bad ways to get help in emergencies and other time-critical situations.\n\nNote that the photo is at an angle, but the view out of the window shows the airplane to be in level flight. This could be due to haste taking the picture, or a feigned haste in taking the picture, or could suggest that, for whatever reason, the photo is making the situation seem worse than it is.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A Smartphone is shown with the screen facing the viewer. On the screen is the Tinder UI. The main photo is of Cueball, in the cockpit of a plane which appears to be tilting to the right, holding up a makeshift sign saying:]\n:If you know how\n:to fly a plane\n:please swipe\n:right ASAP\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Smartphones]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]"
