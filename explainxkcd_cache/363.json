The purpose of such signs is to inspire employees by proudly displaying how long the event has been avoided or prevented. The most common version of such signs, used in industrial workplaces, displays the number of days since the last workplace accident or injury.\n\nIn the comic, the sign instead references the number of days since the sign itself was reset, which self-referential and rather useless except as a joke, and thus is an unusual thing to have a sign for. Depending on how the word 'reset' is interpreted, the text on the sign is also a paradox. Computer-minded people tend to interpret 'reset' as 'reboot' or 'set to zero', but it can also mean 're-set' or 'set again'. [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/reset See definition.]\n\n''Interpretation 1: 'reset' == 'set to zero':''<br>\nIn this interpretation, there is no paradox, and the sign can be seen as a {{w|Reactance (psychology)|challenge/invitation}}. It could also act as a kind of 'resource dilemma' game, where there is prestige or infamy in resetting the sign when it reads a high number, but waiting too long will mean that someone else will take the reward.\n\n''Interpretation 2: 'reset' == 'set again':''<br>\nBecause the sign uses manual flip cards, one cannot add days to the counter without re-setting the sign, which creates a paradox: either you add a day by re-setting it (which, according to the sign, means you'd have to reset the sign to 0) or you don't (in which case the value on the sign would not be valid). The value of the sign cannot be true for more than one day. The value of the sign in the comic (38) can only be true if someone flipped the cards 38 days ago. \n\nSelf-reference is a [[:Category:Self-reference|recurring theme]] in xkcd. Examples include [[33: Self-reference]] and [[688: Self-Description]].\n\nThe title text refers to the signs sometimes hung over roadways in front of bridges that display the clearance of the bridge for the benefit of tall vehicles. However, this sign displays only its own clearance, a number that would be unimportant if the sign itself were not there (yet more self-reference).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stands in front of a doorway looking at a flip-counter sign posted on a wall.]\n:Sign: 38 days since someone reset this sign\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Self-reference]]"
