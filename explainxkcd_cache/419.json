That's when Spielberg caught wind of it.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe comic shows scientists testing a new technology to blend species. \n\nThey show that their new technology allows them to cross a {{w|spork}} (an even mix between a spoon and a fork) with a spoon to make a new implement that is three-quarters spoon and one-quarter fork. By blending these new fork-spork hybrids and their results together, the scientists could create any mix between a spoon and a fork. (Obviously, regular genetics cannot apply to non-living items such as metal cutlery.){{Citation needed}}\n\nIn the second panel, the amounts of spoon and fork are shown with fractions: the number on the left representing the amount of fork, and the right the amount of spoon. The numbers for the cross product below are arrived at by summing each side and dividing by two: (0+1/2)/2 = 1/4 and (1+1/2)/2 = 3/4.\n\nThe breeding scheme between the second and the third panel shows at the top how to create a spork from a spoon and a fork, then how this spork could both be bred with either a spoon (as in panel two) or a fork (as shown in the lower right part).\n\nThe {{w|binary}} \"fork-spoon spectrum\" in between the third and fourth panels shows the complete spectrum of sporks from fork to spoon with some of the intermediate steps labeled, the numbers representing how much fork each contains. Since it is a binary spectrum, only fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2 will be possible, i.e. 2^n with n any integer. So in the middle is a spork with 1/2 fork, in between the spork and the spoon there is only 1/4 fork, and in between that and the spoon only 1/8 fork, and so on. Also 3/4 fork is marked, whereas 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8 fork is only indicated on the ruler by small marks. For instance, they could breed a 3/8 fork-spork by mixing a 1/4 fork-spork with a spork (or, if they already have them, a 1/8th version with a 5/8th version, or a 3/16th with a 9/16th; it can be shown that ''any'' two values of the form ''n/2<sup>m</sup>'', where are integers, will have a midpoint also of that form, and there are an arbitrary number of ways to reach the latter, although you could constrain yourself to only crossing pairs that produce a result which must be expressed with values of ''m'' greater than either of the 'parents' require<!-- Tempted to explain that even in this case, 9/16 could be parented by 1/2 and 5/8 ''or'' 3/8 and 3/4, in which case you could additionally specify that all pairings are only of values already exhaustively established on the numberline, as the only *necessary* parentage ever invoked... but it doesn't actually matter what prior creations you  establish a new mid-point between. -->). In mathematics, the set of \"binary fractions\" is called the set of {{w|dyadic fractions}}.\n\nThe comic begins like standard sci-fi fare, where amoral scientists request funding from mysterious benefactors. The dialogue of \"You're toying with powerful forces here\" and \"We know what we're doing\" is a {{tvtropes|TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow|classic trope}}, foreshadowing that things will soon {{tvtropes|GoneHorriblyWrong|go horribly wrong}}. It inevitably leads to the humorous incongruity of a sentient spoon-fork-hybrid on a murderous rampage, which is impossible in real life.{{Citation needed}}\n\n{{w|Rachael Ray}} and {{w|Emeril}}, mentioned in the title text, are celebrity chefs, and {{w|Steven Spielberg}} is a famous movie director. The joke seems to be that if the laboratory hadn't hired the two renowned chefs, Spielberg wouldn't have heard about the project and would not have made a movie about it - in which the two scientists are killed off horribly (it is probably the scientist from the first panel, [[Megan]], and her friend, [[Cueball]], or the actors hired to portray them in the film). The plot in the comic is very similar to the story in Spielberg's ''{{W|Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park}}''.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Megan: A spoon crossed with a fork is a spork.\n:Off-panel Megan's voice: Our lab has successfully crossed a <u>spork</u> with a spoon.
