In referencing that movie, Randall agrees with that opinion and expresses the theme of regret in a completely different context by suggesting that people who watched the movie overwhelmingly regretted doing so.\n\nAfter this comic was released, the search results for ''\"I'm glad I saw Epic Movie\"'' at Google did grow up to more than 8,000 results.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Bar Graph]\n:Number of Google results for: \"I _____ have kissed her\" (or him)\n:Shouldn't: 1,213\n:Should: 10,230\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Bar charts]]\n[[Category:Google Search]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
