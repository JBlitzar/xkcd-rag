However, being very cautious, [[Randall]] is cutting down the scope for his first \"post-pandemic\" party from that of a normal party. Not all of the scope reductions make sense.{{Citation needed}}\n\n===Drinks===\n* Instead of serving the alcoholic or sugary beverages that would be typical for a party, the scope is reduced by serving plain ice water.\n* Instead of serving the ice water in ordinary-sized cups, the scope is further reduced by serving it in small cups.\n\n===Food===\n* A person holding an ordinary party might provide large quantities of foods of various sorts. Randall is reducing scope by serving only two types of food, {{w|M&M's|''m&m's''}} and {{w|saltine cracker}}s.\n* He is further reducing scope by limiting the quantities: each guest will be provided with three individual pieces of candy and one single cracker.\n\n===Entertainment===\n* Instead of party music, Randall's party has slower-paced {{w|ambient music}}.\n* {{w|Karaoke}} has been eliminated completely.\n* The big-screen TV has been reduced to a standard TV, and instead of showing sports games, it will show painting lessons by {{w|Bob Ross}}.\n\n===Activities===\n* Board games have been replaced with {{w|52 pickup}}. Having already downsized to a single game, he further reduces the scope by reducing the number of cards involved from 52 to 3.\n* His original notes indicate that the party might include both video games and ping pong, but he has reduced scope here as well by merging these activities and offering only a single video game, {{w|Pong}}.\n* Finally, while conversation will be allowed, Randall is reducing scope by reducing quality. This element of the party plan is qualitatively different from the others because it's generally the guests themselves that provide the majority of the conversation at a party, so it's possible that Randall is simply acknowledging [[2424|the effect]] that the pandemic has had on peoples' ability to converse normally.\n\nThe title text mentions that even the incredibly mild disruption of 'an m&m' falling into a cup of water caused the party-goers to panic and flee, much as Cueball and Ponytail did in [[2330: Acceptable Risk|a similar situation]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The comic consists of four underlined headings, two by two grid, with three or four lines of text beneath each.
