Cueball mentions that when responding to textual comments on a screen, it can be easy to forget these comments are made by thinking, feeling humans (a sentiment [[438: Internet Argument|expressed before on XKCD]]). Megan agrees, but also relates a negative comment she got from a stranger about her taste in movies. The twist is that it turns out the person criticizing her was a murderer, \"the East Valley Strangler\". Although this does not inherently negate his taste in movies, it does free Megan from the burden of weighing his opinions equally to her own.\n\nThe title-text mentions the “LakeSlayer7” which is clearly a reference to the \"Lake Slayer\" in the comic. They mention, contrary to several other reviewers, that a burger joint in town is unsatisfactory, and that the reader should come to a place “by the lake” instead, which probably is a plot to lure people to the lake and to be slain.\n\nIn many [[918: Google+|social]] and [[997: Wait Wait|news]] sites there is a tendency to surface [[258: Conspiracy Theories|negative content]]. This can be [[1111: Premiere|editorial intent]], [[2237: AI Hiring Algorithm|naive algorithms]], or [[1390: Research Ethics|both]], attempting to induce rage to drive engagement. Review sites can exhibit a [[1098: Star Ratings|bias]] in either direction, with minutiae [[937: TornadoGuard|burying]] valid feedback.\n\nThe East Valley Strangler's involvement with the [[2553: Incident Report|incident at East Valley Nuclear Plant]] is currently unconfirmed.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are having a conversation while walking.]\n:Cueball: The Internet makes it easy to be a jerk and forget the person we're talking to is a human.\n:Megan: Yeah...\n:Megan: But it also makes us see messages from awful people and assume they come from normal peers.\n\n:[Closeup on Megan. Above Megan is a picture of a \"reply\" post from a man with sunglasses. The post has a title above it.]\n:Megan: Recently I got a mean reply from a stranger. It was minor but it really got to me.\n:Post title: Replies to \"Favorite Movie\"\n:Post: Every group has one person who likes that movie, and it's the friend they all secretly hate.\n\n:[Blondie as a news anchor behind a desk.

Megan's dialogue appears above the picture, but she herself is not shown in this panel.]\n:Megan: Then the next week I saw that guy on the news. He was an actual murderer!\n\n:[Megan and Cueball standing next to each other.]\n:Megan: I can't believe I spent a week stressed out that my taste in movies wasn't shared by the East Valley Strangler.\n:Cueball: Yeah, at ''least'' wait for a second opinion from the Lake Slayer.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Blondie]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]"
