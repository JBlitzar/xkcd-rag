This parallels [[2214:_Chemistry_Nobel|Nobel Prizes awarded for the discovery of new elements]]. However, unlike elements, Nobel Prizes cannot be discovered.{{citation needed}}\n\nThe comic suggests that the doctor, presumably a [[1954: Impostor Syndrome|social psychologist and the world's top expert on Impostor Syndrome]], being awarded the prize came up with the idea of \"discovering\" Nobel Prizes, and no one can figure out how to stop awarding them to her.\nIn reality, the categories were established by Alfred Nobel's will for contributions or discoveries in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. In 1968, Sweden's central bank funded an award for economics in honor of its 300th anniversary that is also colloquially called the {{w|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics}}. While there is currently a petition to add a Nobel prize for contributions to environmental conservation, it would presumably also need external funding, although the decision process is unclear. \n\nThe title text is a play on the {{w|Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine}}, insinuating that the {{w|Nobel Assembly}} (the group in charge of awarding Nobel Prizes) has become so desperate to stop Doctor Adams that they have decided to award a Nobel Prize to anyone who can make her stop 'discovering' new prizes. Given that each prize comes with a monetary reward of 11 million {{w|Swedish kroner|kroner}} (just over a million US dollars), this desperation may be fuelled by the threat of Dr. Adams bankrupting the Nobel Foundation, with her becoming very wealthy in the process. The joke also plays on the name of the said prize, because as of the writing of this comic the {{w|Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine}} is the only Nobel Prize with two subjects (i.e. with \"or\" in the title). This may also be a jab by Randall at the fields of Physiology and Medicine, as poking fun at other disciplines is a recurring theme on xkcd. {{citation needed}}\n\nThis comic was published on the Monday the week following the announcements of the 2021 Nobel Prize recipients.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands at a podium on a stage, facing right.
