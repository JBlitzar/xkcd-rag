Black Hat, owing to his destructive nature, has created a machine that is able to blow out the car's speakers. The machine evidently does this by playing the same soundwaves back at the car but with the {{w|Phase (waves)|phase}} slightly offset, tuning the phase difference to create a {{w|resonance}} in the car's speakers big enough for them to destroy themselves. In a stroke of evil, he then starts playing Shirley Ellis' ''{{w|The Name Game}}'' to show how annoying the man was acting. Cueball is horrified by this act of evil, as Black Hat carries on into the song {{w|Macarena (song)|''Macarena''}}.\n\nThe title text refers to comic [[316: Loud Sex]], where an elliptical reflector is used to focus sound waves from a couple having sex. Black Hat obviously gets annoyed by this and sometimes uses his machine to retaliate.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Cueball are standing in a room with one window. Black Hat is pushing a box with an elliptical dish on top towards the window.]\n:''THUMPA THUMPA''\n\n:Cueball: The bass from that car is driving me nuts.\n:Black Hat: Me too. Give me a hand here.\n\n:[The dish is aimed out the window; Black Hat plugs the device into the wall.]\n:Cueball: I'm afraid to ask.\n:Black Hat: The system detects bass rhythms and floods the target with a phase-shifted replica signal.\n:Black Hat: The resonance should blow out their speakers.\n\n:[The side of a building. The dish of the device is visible through a window, emitting sound waves.]\n:''THUMPA THUMPA''\n:''BLAM''\n\n:[Back in the room.]\n:Black Hat: Speakers down. Now flip that red switch.\n:[Cueball does so with a \"click.\"]\n\n:[Back to the outside view, more sound waves.]\n:'''''SHIRLEY SHIRLEY BO BIRLEY BANANA FANNA FO FIRLEY'''''\n:Cueball: You're horrifying.\n:Black Hat: Okay, now throw the switch labeled \"Macarena\".\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Science]]"
