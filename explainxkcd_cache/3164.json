In this case, instead of doing it normally (i.e. converting each part of the measurement to metric, combining them, and then saying the complete converted measurement), [[Cueball]]'s response to [[White Hat]]'s question is to give the first part of the measurement in the {{w|Imperial units|imperial system}} (or the practically equivalent {{w|United States customary units}}), and then the second part in {{w|Metric system|metric}}. This is worse than saying it all in one single system, as it is much more awkward and confusing for the receiver.\n\nThe title text gives another example of Cueball's conversion system, in which he gives the weight (or ''perhaps'' {{w|Weight#Mass|mass}}) of a package as being seven kilograms and nine ounces, converting between metric and imperial partway through the statement (rather than starting with imperial and ending with metric). However, this is [[technically]] worse, as kilograms are strictly a unit of mass whereas ounces ''can'' be a unit of mass but are usually effectively either one of {{w|Ounce#Definitions|a number of measurements of weight}} ''or'' (in line with popular US usage) a {{w|Fluid ounce|volume}} measurement. In this case, 7 kg 9 oz is approximately 16 lbs or 265 ounces (which in turn would be exactly 0.008 short tons; or about 0.00714 long tons, 7.255 kg, 37,588.652 carats, 333,415,012.56 Planck masses, etc).\n\nA strategy for transitioning to the metric system was also mentioned in [[526: Converting to Metric]], although in that case the strategy was a practical one, unlike this comic.\n\n[[:Category:Multiple Cueballs|This Cueball's]] height is 5'9\" (176 cm), the {{w|Average human height by country|average}} for a white male adult in the United States.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[White Hat and Cueball are standing and facing each other.]\n\n:White Hat: How tall are you?\n:Cueball: 5&nbsp;ft 24&nbsp;cm\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]  \n:When switching to metric, make the process easier by doing it in steps.\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Tips]]"
