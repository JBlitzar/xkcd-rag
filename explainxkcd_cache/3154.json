But when I do it, I get 'detained by security' for 'injuring several tourists.'\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] complains that the same proposal related to the physics concept of {{w|spacetime}} (using the {{w|Lorentz transformation}} to relate the flow of time in a reference frame to that frame's velocity) is treated very differently when made by him, compared to when made by {{w|Albert Einstein}}, a famous physicist. [[White Hat]] agrees, using the standard shorthand for this sort of inconsistency: \"double standard\" (two different standards of expectations or treatment, each applied to a different person or group). The joke is that there are good reasons for the difference in experiences:\n\n*Cueball's idea is not impressive to others because they already knew about it due to the work of Einstein and the wider science community since then. Einstein's new use of the transformation as part of special relativity was a breakthrough when published just over 120 years before the comic.\n*Even if two people discover something with the same level of insight and effort, society accords far more prestige to the first acknowledged discoverer, for solving a problem or revealing new possibilities. Early discoverers or prior contributors may be overlooked in unfair ways, and may have grounds to complain about a double standard. Since Cueball is saying this at a time when the finding has already become part of an undergraduate curriculum, this does not apply to him.\n*Once an idea has been popularized, it becomes easier to accidentally rediscover. Cueball might have never been taught about Einstein's finding directly, but has probably heard of physics concepts that derive from it. Rediscovering a model for associating time and space is easier for someone raised with the concept of spacetime. The Lorentz transformation was developed before Einstein's theories of relativity, so a student learning about physics in chronological order might well make the same connection: that the theory can be used in new ways once basic spacetime insights are added.\n*The concept may have been taught to Cueball, who might have forgotten or not paid attention, and then later found the \"discovery\" much easier thanks to subconscious memories.\n*Cueball might even have consciously learned the concept from others, but believes that the accordance of \"genius\" status to Einstein came from Einstein's merely describing the concept, as opposed to being a recognition of the long work of developing the concept independently.\n\nThe comic might be making fun of people whom [[Randall]] views as having similar misconceptions.\n\nThe title text continues the joke, but this time (re)creating {{w|Galileo_Galilei|Galileo}}'s demonstration of {{w|Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment|acceleration under gravity}} involving dropping different objects off the top of the {{w|Leaning Tower of Pisa}}. (Unlike the speaker, Galileo likely [https://theconversation.com/el-experimento-mas-famoso-de-galileo-probablemente-nunca-tuvo-lugar-111650 never actually carried out the experiment].) In this case the speaker was detained because the area below the tower was busy with tourists, some of whom were hit and injured by the objects dropped.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Cueball is talking to White Hat, arms outstretched.]\n:Cueball: Sure, when '''''Einstein''''' suggests using the Lorentz transform to explain the connection between velocity and time, people call him a genius.\n:Cueball: But when '''''I''''' suggest it, it's \"basic physics\" and \"undergraduate stuff.\"\n:White Hat: Such a double standard!\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring White Hat]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Albert Einstein]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
