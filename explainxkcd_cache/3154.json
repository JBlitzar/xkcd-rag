Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n[[Cueball]], presumably an undergraduate, suggests that he should be considered a great physicist because he said something Einstein said, the fact that he isn't is called a double standard by [[White Hat]]. The joke is that Cueball did not come up with the theory, but was rather taught this, so he was not unique in his suggestion and also saying something widely known.\n\nPerhaps the comic is making fun of people whom Randall views as doing this often.\n\nThe title text continues the joke, but with Galileo instead of Einstein and him even being detained because he hit someone, in Galileo's time however, this would probably not been an issue as there were fewer people and the authorities were less worried about that than they are now {{Citation Needed}}.\n\nCueball's idea is not impressive because he is just restating and redoing what has already been done.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{incomplete transcript|Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\n:[Cueball is talking to White Hat, arms outstretched.]\n:Cueball: Sure, when '''''Einstein''''' suggests using the Lorentz transform to explain the connection between velocity and time, people call him a genius.\n:Cueball: But when '''''I''''' suggest it, it's \"basic physics\" and \"undergraduate stuff.\"\n:White Hat: Such a double standard!\n\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>"
