R. R. Tolkien}}. The joke is that while Martin and Aragorn introduce themselves separately, they then go on to describe their particular story, which turns out to be exactly the same for both of them. Subsequently Martin jinxes Aragorn. {{w|Jinx (children's game)|Jinx}} is a common children's game that is initiated by shouting \"Jinx\" after somebody speaks the same word or sentence at the same time as you. That person is then jinxed, with one form of the rules dictating that they are then not permitted to speak until unjinxed by some specific action (usually somebody saying their name). For a similar children’s game, see [[392: Making Rules]].\n\nIn ''LOTR'', orcs are unequivocally and without exception the bad guys, capable only of hate and violence (although to be fair, in some of Tolkien's unpublished writing, orcs are corrupted elves, so it is clear that they are not intrinsically bad). Similarly, Redwall's rats, foxes, ferrets, ermine, and weasels are mostly evil manipulators, while mice, rabbits, squirrels, hedgehogs, and badgers are always the good guys. On several occasions, characters explicitly state that \"vermin stays vermin.\" This is the overarching rule, notwithstanding the rare exception (e.g. Grubbage from {{w|Triss}}). Conversely, one of the so-called \"good species\" has never become evil in this book series. Though it is more likely than not that this is simply the result of a {{tvtropes|PlanetOfHats|planet of hats}} - where a single species all share the same characteristics and personality, so that authors / readers don't have to spend time fleshing out / getting to know every new character - Randall nevertheless indicates that this \"moral absolute\" is problematic and has some \"racist undertones,\" regardless if it's intentional or not. (Note that Tolkien's work is probably not actually racist—the Easterlings are portrayed as non-evil people who were deceived by Sauron, and the Orcs deliberately modified into evil. However, Orcs do bear a startling similarity to the worst Mongol stereotypes.)\n\nThe second panel deals with the fact that ''Redwall'' mentions the name of {{w|Satan}} or {{w|The Devil}} 4 times, while it never mentions {{w|God}} or {{w|Jesus}}--somewhat surprisingly, given that the book is set in an abbey, and many of the inhabitants are religious brothers and sisters. [[Randall Munroe|Randall]] then points out that people who {{w|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|protest against Harry Potter because of the series' witchcraft}}, should take note that Redwall explicitly mentions Satan, although it has had little to no negative feedback from more conservative readers.\n\nIn the third panel, Randall comments on ''Redwall'''s often-used theme of critical messages being left in riddles throughout the Abbey for the occupants to find when they are in need. Randall suggests that he would use {{w|Public-key cryptography|public-key cryptography}} to encode the messages, instead of the elaborate riddles used in the books (all of which are solved in a matter of days after being discovered more or less by chance, which doesn't exactly make for good security when dealing with sensitive and occasionally time-critical information).\n\nIn the title text, Randall jokes that he is making a crossover {{w|Fan fiction|fan-fiction}} with ''Redwall'' and ''{{w|Jurassic Park}}''. This would combine two of Randall's interests, but it isn't immediately clear how the two settings could be combined, leading to several humorous possibilities: the characters of ''Redwall'' could be immediately eaten by dinosaurs, could create dinosaurs which turn against them, could be created by human scientists and turn against them, or simply be talking, social dinosaurs.\n\nRedwall was also referenced in [[1286: Encryptic]], [[1688: Map Age Guide]], and [[1722: Debugging]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.\n\n:Some of this feels familiar.\n:Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn.\n:Martin: I'm Martin.\n:Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones.\n:Martin: Jinx!\n\n:It startled me when characters mentioned Satan.\n:Redwall: \"By Satan's whiskers...\"\n:Redwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times.\n:Redwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times.\n:(Harry Potter protesters, take note.)\n\n:Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently.\n:Matthias: The inscription is a message from Martin!\n:Brother Methuselah: What does it say?\n:Matthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Bar charts]]\n[[Category:LOTR]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Cryptography]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Harry Potter]]\n[[Category:Redwall]]"
