(Despite the claims of the first panel, the movie was actually released on 31 March 1999 in the US, although it was next released in Australia on 8 April 1999.) [[Megan]] is shocked when she realizes it is already ten years ago that ''The Matrix'' came out. This is an effect Randall has used to [[:Category:Comics_to_make_one_feel_old|make you feel old]] several times (for instance he mentions The Matrix again two years later in [[891: Movie Ages]].)\n\nIn ''The Matrix'', almost all of humanity lives in a computer simulation. Many years ago, robots took over the real world (not the simulation), and placed humans into the simulation while their body heat generated power for the robots. A few people have escaped from the Matrix, and they are on a mission with others to free the human race from the robots. The title of the strip is a reference to the documentary on the filming of ''The Matrix'': ''{{w|The Matrix Revisited}}''.\n\nIn the first three rows of the comic we see three famous scenes from ''The Matrix'' parodied by Randall. The characters are {{w|Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus}}, with sunglasses; {{w|Neo (The Matrix)|Neo}}, as [[Cueball]] in the first two scenes and with a black coat in the third scene; {{w|Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity}}, as [[Hairbun]]; and a security guard in the third scene, as another Cueball-like guy.\n\nIn the first scene Morpheus tells Neo that one cannot explain what the Matrix is and that he must see it for himself to understand. Morpheus is very mysterious as he tempts Neo to take a look himself, which, in the movie, leads to the next scene. In this comic, however, Trinity makes Morpheus look foolish by clearly explaining the Matrix in a single, simple phrase, and then telling him that he must suck at explaining. (The actual quote from the movie is <q>no one can <em>be told</em> what the Matrix is</q>, which makes more sense: even after being rescued from the Matrix, Neo at first refuses to accept that his entire life has been a simulation, becoming highly distraught when confronted with that truth. Morpheus later mentions that for this reason, it is unusual to rescue people past a certain age.)\n\nIn the next scene Morpheus (ignoring Trinity's remark, or in a separate rerun of the interaction) has reached the part of the scene where he shows Neo two pills, one red and one blue, and tells Neo that he can either take the blue pill and return to the simulation (the Matrix), never to hear about the Matrix again, or he can take the red pill and leave the Matrix, and \"see how deep the rabbit hole goes\" (a reference to ''{{w|Alice in Wonderland}}''). In the movie, Neo takes the red pill. In the comic, however, he mixes the two pills then {{w|Insufflation_(medicine)|snorts}} the purple powder he has created as though it was an illegal drug such as cocaine, and apparently winds up in a bizarre upside down and inverted dimension, presumably caused by his 'Drug Trip'. Even Morpheus now has no idea where they are. Note that the inversion of both color and orientation could be intended to evoke the idea of capturing an image on film (i.e. a film negative), which is ''really'' the only place where Neo and Morpheus exist. It is possible that the combination of pills allowed Neo to break through another layer of the simulation. Alternatively, this could simply be Randall trying to explain that they are in an alternate dimension whilst still remaining within the constraints of stick figures on white and black backgrounds.\n\nThe third scene is at the point that Neo and Trinity must save Morpheus, who has been captured by {{w|Agent (The Matrix)|agents}} of the simulation. They obtain many guns and much ammunition, holstering and clipping a large amount of their stock beneath trenchcoats (the remainder in large canvas bags that they carry). We are shown the point at which Neo is stopped at a security checkpoint in a building in the Matrix. A {{w|Metal detector#Security screening|security arch}} has shown him to have metal on his person, typically indicative of having inadvertently taken keys through the gateway rather than sending them through the luggage scanner (which has not yet shown the bag contents). A security guard tells him to remove any metallic items (such as the keys) and place them in a container in order to walk again through the scanner, cleanly. In the movie, he opens his trenchcoat to revealing his myriad of weapons, surprising the previously unwary guard, and then (with the assistance of Trinity) proceeds to dispatch all of the outclassed and outgunned guards that are present or arrive in immediate response. In the comic, Neo also opens his trenchcoat, but the guard's response of \"eww\" implies that Neo may instead be {{w|Exhibitionism#Types of exposure|mostly naked underneath}} and the guard is disgusted by him flashing his genitals.\n\nBack in the real world, after watching the movie, Cueball turns to his friends (Megan and another Cueball-like guy) and exclaims that he had forgotten how great the movie is. When his friend suggests that they put on the other two sequels, there is a beat panel where Megan and Cueball look at each other, then they beat up the offender off-panel. \n\nThe two sequels to ''The Matrix'' are widely regarded as inferior to the original, with some fans {{tvtropes|FanonDiscontinuity|pretending they don't exist}}. This is what happens when Megan and Cueball return, and Cueball repeats his statement about how good it was. Then Megan is saddened by the fact they never made any sequels and Cueball agrees, having tried hard (even violently) to forget those sequels. In the title text, however, Randall disagrees with the characters in the comics, remarking that he enjoyed the films when he watched them in the movie theater, but agrees that they are not as good as the original.\n\nOn {{w|IMDb}} the original movie was still in the top 20 on their [http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?tt0133093&ref_=tt_awd top 250 chart] in December 2023, with an average of [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/ 8.7] vs. only [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215 7.2] and [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653 6.7] to the sequels (though even those two scores are relatively high compared to other action titles).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan stands below two pieces of text, in a panel that is without a frame.]\n:Today was the ten-year anniversary of the release of ''The Matrix.'' \n:I sat down to watch it again.\n:Megan: Holy fuck, ten years ago?\n\n:[The next three panels of the first row and the next two rows spoofs three scenes from The Matrix.]\n\n:[In scene 1 Morpheus with sunglasses and Trinity with hair bun are talking to Cueball-Neo. Morpheus has his hands together.]\n:Morpheus: Unfortunately, no one can explain what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.\n\n:[Trinity lifts her hand.]\n:Trinity: Sure you can. It's a computer simulation in which you live, thinking it's reality.\n:Neo: Oh.\n\n:[Morpheus takes his hands down and turns around glaring at Trinity who has also taken her hand down.]\n:Trinity: ...What? \n:Trinity: Look, maybe you just suck at explaining.\n\n:[In scene 2 Morpheus is talking to Neo while holding a red pill and a blue pill. To the far right is a part of a table.]\n:Morpheus: ...Or you take the red pill, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\n:[Neo takes both pills from Morpheus.]\n\n:[Neo crushes both the red and blue pills on a table top.]\n:''Crush''\n\n:[Neo snorts the resulting purple powder through a pipe he holds up to his face (his nose).]\n:''Snort''\n\n:[Morpheus and Neo are shown upside down in a frame with inverted colors, i.e., black background with white lines.]\n:Morpheus: <u>Now</u> look what you've done.\n:Neo: Where ''are'' we?\n:Morpheus: I have no idea.\n\n:[In scene 3 Neo, wearing a long, black trench coat, at a metal detector, is accosted by the Cueball-like security guard.]\n:Guard: Please remove any keys, metallic items, weaponsâ€”\n\n:[Neo steps close to the guard and opens his trench coat towards the guard, who is facing the reader. The reader can't see what Neo has under his coat.]\n\n:[Same scene as above, but side view: Neo, on the left, is opening his coat toward the guard, who is on the right and seems to be looking down. Nobody speaks.]\n\n:[Same scene as above but the guard now looks up to Neos face and finally speaks:]\n:Guard: Eww.\n\n:[In the last row of the comic we see three characters that have obviously just finished watching The Matrix. Cueball is sitting on the floor nearest to the TV, Megan is sitting on the floor, farther from the TV and a Cueball-like friend is sitting on an armchair, farthest from the TV.]\n:Cueball: I forgot how good that movie was.\n:Friend: Wanna put on the other two?\n\n:[Cueball, still sitting has turned to face Megan. They exchange looks without speaking.]\n\n:[View of room, which is now empty, as is the chair. Sounds comes from off-screen to the right.]\n:''Crash''\n:''Wham'' \n:Friend (off-screen): Ow! Ow!\n\n:[Cueball and Megan are back in the room, zoomed in so the TV is no longer visible, but the chair is and it remains empty. The friend is nowhere to be seen.]\n:Cueball: I forgot how good that movie was.\n:Megan: Too bad they never made any sequels.\n:Cueball: True.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The 6th, 7th and 8th panels have been turned into an internet meme.{{Actual citation needed}}\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairbun]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:The Matrix]]\n[[Category:Comics to make one feel old]]"
