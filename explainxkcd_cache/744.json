'okay, we're almost at the spawn point... separate the labia, but watch out, there are more inside them...\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nA {{w|Video game walkthrough|walkthrough video}} is a recorded explanation of how to accomplish a certain task, usually beating a video game (or a particular level of one). A {{w|speedrun}} is an attempt to complete a level or game as fast as possible. The man is implying that because he followed the speedrun video, intercourse didn't last long enough to satisfy his partner â€” who now probably doesn't want to date him again as a result.\n\nThe title text (humorously) shows what the narration on such a video might be like, based on typical video game walkthroughs. In a video game, a {{w|Spawning (video games)|spawn point}} is a place where enemies, items, or players will appear; here, {{w|Spawn (biology)|spawn}} is also being used in the biological sense of mating and reproduction. The \"separate... more inside\" part is similar to typical instructions about how to get past certain enemies or traps, while it could also refer to the labia majora and minora. Separating the labia majora would reveal the labia minora.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball sits at a computer. His friend enters the room.]\n:Cueball: How did the date go?\n:Friend: I wanted to be prepared, so I looked up a sex walkthrough video.\n\n:[The two men silently contemplate the words of the previous panel.]\n\n:[Cueball turns his head around. His friend looks down.]\n:Cueball: ...and?\n:Friend: It turns out it was a speed run.\n:Cueball: Ouch.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]"
