What right do we have to poke around in Facebook's private affairs like that?\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic references the recent revelation that {{w|Facebook}} engaged in a \"{{w|Experimental psychology|psychological experiment}}\" by selectively showing users more \"positive\" or \"negative\" posts on their news feed and recording the users' comments to see if the change affected the positivity or negativity of their posts. Further experiments have since been revealed [http://online.wsj.com/articles/facebook-experiments-had-few-limits-1404344378 such as one that tested security measures by locking users out of their accounts].\n\nHere, [[Megan]] is commenting on the fact that, while the media is calling this control over what content the user sees \"{{w|unethical}},\" Facebook, and other companies like {{w|Google}}, must, one way or another, control what content the user sees, whether to present users with a limited selection of all postings, or to tailor ads to particular users; even if the regular algorithms are not set up for psychological experiments, they are still \"manipulating\" what posts users see or don't see. As Megan points out, no one really knows what the \"normal\" constraints are of the algorithm which chooses which posts are shown on news feeds. This comic is parodying the strong reaction to what is basically already a common practice.\n\nAccumulation, control and analysis of user-generated information can be a part of the {{w|terms of service}}/{{w|end-user license agreement}} of a Website or software. In such a scenario, the user has effectively signed his/her consent to being part of such research. Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the \"I agree\" option, so it can come as a shock when the service uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated. In the comic [[743: Infrastructures]] are the same issues with Facebook and open source. And in [[1150: Instagram]] the subject is again about how users feel used by social networks, this time by {{w|Instagram}}, which is now owned by Facebook.\n\nThe title text ironically/sarcastically accepts that Facebook has access to all of its users thoughts through posts and photos, and they can read them for research or other purposes, but contrasts this with a suggestion which likely mirrors how Facebook would respond to such a request that Facebook's code is private and can not be revealed to us. The title text basically appears to be musing that this is backwards, and our personal data should be considered MORE private than Facebook's programming code, which may be proprietary, but is not personal private data. It can be argued though that no one is forcing people to hand all their personal data to Facebook. If someone feels, maybe justified, that the situation is unfair, they are free not to use Facebook. It is as if someone you invited into your house was spying on you, but you felt it to be inappropriate to find out what he knew about you because that's his business. Asking for the source code might be equivalent to asking that person for the specifications of the binoculars they used for spying.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is facing Cueball and Ponytail.]\n:Megan: Facebook shouldn't choose what stuff they show us to conduct unethical psychological research.\n:Megan: They should ''only'' make those decisions based on, uh...\n:Megan: However they were doing it before.\n:Megan: Which was probably ethical, right?\n\n==Trivia==\nIn the [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/archive/a/a3/20140704163127!research_ethics.png original version of the comic], [[Randall]] accidentally wrote \"what\" twice in a row, first at the end of the first line and then again at the start of the second line. This is a classic optical illusion. Since he didn't do it on purpose, he quickly corrected the error and loaded the current version up on xkcd.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Social networking]]\n[[Category:Comics edited after their publication]]"
