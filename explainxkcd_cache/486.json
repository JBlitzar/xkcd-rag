Megan simply facepalms and leaves.\n\nThe title text jokes that Megan simply wanted to talk to Cueball about his poor smoke-bomb techniques. Arguably, then, this instance was actually a qualified success in issue avoidance.\n\nHe continued to keep smoke bombs on his person for situations such as these as seen in the title text of [[1712: Politifact]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan facing each other in the same panel.]\n:Megan: We need to talk.\n\n:[Cueball turns to look behind him; panel pans back to show a (closed) window on the wall.]\n\n:[Cueball throws a smoke grenade to the floor.]\n:''POW''\n\n:[Grenade fizzles and begins to emit smoke; Cueball and Megan both look down at it.]\n:''sssss''\n\n:[Smoke cloud expands very slightly. Megan puts her hand to her face.]\n:''cough''\n\n:[The smoke detector alarm above them starts beeping. Both look up.]\n:BEEP BEE-\n\n:[Cueball and Megan look down at the grenade again. The alarm is still beeping.]\n:-P BEEP BEEP BEEP BE-\n\n:[Cueball slowly backs away. The alarm is still beeping.]\n:-EP BEEP BEEP BEEP B-\n\n:[Cueball unsuccessfully tries to open the apparently locked window. The alarm is still beeping.]\n:''Rattle rattle''\n:-BEEP BEEP-\n\n:[Panel pans back to the full view. Cueball looks back at Megan, who is now face-palming. The alarm is still beeping.]\n:-BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP B-\n\n:[Megan turns and walks away. Cueball looks at the window. The alarm is still beeping.]\n:-EEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEE-\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
