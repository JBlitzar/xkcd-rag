This information may vary widely in scope and value, ranging from archaeological to the ability to read minds. [[Cueball]] describes himself as such a person, to which [[Megan]] responds with disbelief because it is a bold and unsupported claim. To prove his abilities, Cueball has Megan think of a random number from 1 to 100, which he then guesses correctly to demonstrate his ability to read minds. Megan is amazed that Cueball was correct, but he simply dismisses her disbelief and wants to go back to pretending to lead a normal life.\n\nThe four panels are actually a setup to the real joke in this comic: the final sentence spoken by a narrator. It reveals that Cueball has simply played a trick on Megan and that anyone can repeat it. The joke is that, theoretically, a person can guess a random number from 1 to 100 once in one hundred tries, or 1% of the time, according to the {{w|law of large numbers}}. By playing this trick enough times on enough friends, the trickster is statistically likely to get a number right eventually. Assuming the person whose number he guesses is not familiar with the trick, it will appear as if the trickster is actually psychic. Should this happen, the trickster can then play the joke out as he wants, hence the \"it's totally worth it\" at the end.\n\nThe title text appeals again to statistics. People are poor [http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/02/05/is-17-the-most-random-number/ random-number generators]â€”e.g. being less likely to pick numbers at the extremes or exactly in the middle. Knowing this, the 'psychic' could restrict their guesses accordingly, improving their odds of guessing correctly.\n\n[[Randall]] has made several smaller references to the number 42 as the answer to the ultimate question about the universe from Douglas Adams Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (for instance in [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/1/1c/42_coins.PNG this message] from [[1608: Hoverboard]], and the vision test in [[1213: Combination Vision Test]]. This could be the reason he chose 42+1 as his guess. He both knows Megan, and knows that she knows him. So thinking that he may suspect she would choose 42, she thus adds one, to not choose that exact number... Cueball took a similar reasoning based on his knowledge of Megan and himself, and was lucky this time. Maybe thus increasing his chance to more than 1% as from the title text.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is talking with Megan.]\n:Cueball: I'm psychic, you know.\n:Megan: There's no such thing.\n\n:[In a frame-less panel they continue to talk.]\n:Cueball: Okay, think of a number from one to one hundred.\n:Megan: Okay.\n:Cueball: 43.\n:Megan: Holy shit!\n\n:[Cueball lifts one hand towards Megan.]\n:Cueball: I try not to let it affect my life too much.\n:Megan: Wait, I can't believe this.\n\n:[Cueball turns and walks away, but stretches his arm back out towards Megan, who is still just standing looking after him.]\n:Cueball: Don't worry about it. Forget I said anything.\n:Megan: But-\n:Cueball: Let's get to the movie.\n:Megan: I, uh... OK, sure.\n\n:[Caption below the last two panels:]\n:This trick may only work 1% of the time, but when it does, it's totally worth it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*This comic has a clear resemblance to the [[:Category:My Hobby|My Hobby]] series. This would also make it clear the Cueball in this comic is actually [[Randall]].\n*See also [[525: I Know You're Listening]], [[858: Milk]] and [[2203: Prescience]] for similar use of guessing that if correct will make people surprised.\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]"
