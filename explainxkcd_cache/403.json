The nodes could represent for example people, and the edges could represent a connection from having slept together. Now, Megan has such a graph. Arguably, a {{w|symmetric graph|graph that is symmetric}} is nicer than a regular one, which is why Megan suggests that they should sleep together.\n\nThe title text is a small-world joke on the concept of an {{w|Erdős number}}. {{w|Paul Erdős}} was a Hungarian mathematician renowned for his eccentricity and productivity. He holds the world record for the number of published math papers, as well as for the number of collaborative papers. A person's Erdős number is the \"collaborative distance\" between the person and Erdős. Paul Erdős's Erdős number is 0 by definition. All of his 511 collaborators have the Erdős number of 1; anyone further (excluding Erdős and such an individual) who has collaborated on a mathematical or scientific paper with any of those collaborators has an Erdős number of 2, and so on. Thus, if you have written a paper with someone who's written a paper with someone who's written a paper with Paul Erdős, your Erdős number is 3. If you know a mathematician or are a mathematician, you can calculate their or your Erdős number [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html here].\n\nThis may also be a reference to Chapter 4 of {{w|Candide}}, wherein Pangloss tells the protagonist of the genealogy of his syphilis.  He received the disease from Paquette, who acquired it from a {{w|Franciscans|Franciscan}}, as so on until the lineage starts with one of the adventurers of {{w|Christopher Columbus}}.\n\nIn [[599: Apocalypse]], Cueball actually manages to write a paper with zombie Erdős, thus having a Erdős number of 1.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan sit at a small table in a cafe. Megan holds up a graph.]\n:Megan: We're a terrible match. But if we sleep together, it'll make the local hookup network a symmetric graph.\n:Cueball: I can't argue with that.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Sex]]"
