He was most dominant in the 2008 Beijing Olympics where he won gold in all of the eight events in which he competed, the record for a single games.\n\n[[Cueball]] and [[Megan]] find that the Olympic medalist is in Megan's pool. He refuses to leave, and is too fast to be caught. Cueball brings in boxes of {{w|Jello}} Mix to fill the pool with, thereby gelifying the pool and trapping Phelps or forcing him to leave.\n\nHowever, according to the title text, after having waited the time necessary for the water to gelify (roughly 2 to 4 hours), Cueball realizes that Phelps has eaten all of the resulting Jello. This adds yet another level of absurdity to the situation. This may be a reference to Phelps being used to eating [https://web.archive.org/web/20101113024452/http://www.michaelphelps.net/michael-phelps-diet/ impressive food quantities (about 10,000 calories daily)], to keep up with his strenuous exercise regimen; or it may be a reference to pictures of Phelps smoking from a bong that arose after the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as marijuana use is often associated with an increased appetite. Otherwise, the text may simply be a reference to Phelps being capable of achieving super-human feats, such as devouring an entire pool full of Jello. However, eating an entire pool filled with Jello is incredibly absurd even compared to these feats of consumption. Filling an entire pool with Jello would take [https://www.quora.com/How-many-boxes-of-Jello-would-it-take-to-fill-a-standard-pool-and-what-would-be-necessary-for-it-to-become-the-correct-consistency/take approximately 5.5 million packets of Jello] and would equate to about 440 million calories. If Phelps kept up with his 10,000 daily calorie diet and ate only Jello, it would take 44,000 days to finish the entire pool of Jello, or about 120 and a half years. \n\nInterestingly enough, just pouring Jello powder into a pool would not solidify the water into Jello. The water would have to be boiled, then quickly chilled, for the Jello to set correctly. As Randall is a scientist, he should have known this; therefore, it's possible that he purposefully ignored this fact in favor of the humor. In 2019, YouTuber Mark Rober made a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPZzrlFCD_I&scrlybrkr=361c99cc video] where he showcased a pool of Jello that he had made and described the science behind it. Michael Phelps' top speed is also only around 2.3 m/s, which can easily be outrun by anyone on land.\n\nThe title text may be referenced by [[1628: Magnus]], where people are thrown into strange contests with others, for example a hot dog-eating contest against the championship race horse Secretariat.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball standing outside their en-Phelps-ified swimming pool.]\n:Cueball: Why is Michael Phelps in your backyard pool?\n:Megan: I don't know.
