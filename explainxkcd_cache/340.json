It'll take me forever to get X working again.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThe {{w|boot sector}} of a hard drive is where the information for {{w|operating system}}s is stored. It tells the computer to load a program; in most cases, this is an operating system. If this sector is overwritten, an operating system stored on the drive can't be booted into.  (Fortunately, repairing a blanked or corrupted boot sector is surprisingly easy, although doing so usually requires the system to be booted from the installation media for the operating system on the drive.)\n\nThe first two panels indicate that [[Megan]] is still mad at [[Cueball]] from a fight from the night before, and the third panel shows promise of her forgiving him through an overly affectionate love note. However, the last panel reveals that she used the love note to overwrite the boot sector of [[Cueball]]'s computer out of anger.\n\nThe ''.conf'' files of {{w|Linux}}- and {{w|Unix}}-based systems are text based files where all the settings for various applications are stored. Since all the configurations were replaced with \"sweet nothings\" - whispered lovers' talk, or literal nothings (blank space or meaningless jumbles of characters) - none of the programs work as they should. X is the {{w|X Window System}}, the most common {{w|GUI}} framework used on modern Linux and Unix systems. Once upon a time, it was notoriously hard to configure correctly, even when starting from a known good configuration, let alone a destroyed one.  (More recent versions of X configure themselves correctly for most users without a ''.conf'' file.)\n\n==Transcript==\n:We had a fight last night.\n:[Cueball is sitting in a sofa, head in both hands, feeling upset.]\n:I guess she's still mad.\n:[Megan is standing with arms crossed in front of her chest, with the same mood.]\n:I woke up to find she'd written a sappy love note\n:[Cueball is standing in front of a computer, with a cup in his hand.]\n:to my boot sector.\n:[The cup now lies on the floor, Cueball is looking at the computer with disbelief.]\n:Computer: Operating system not found\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Linux]]"
