This, though, is the only reference to [[#Trivia|New Year]] in the comic, and serves only as a pretext for [[Cueball]] to note that they are now in an election year, in this context a {{w|President of the United States#Election|US ''Presidential'' election}} year, which occurs every four years and has (in one form or other) since 1788. Ponytail then replies in some form of exasperated tone that they \"keep on happening\", which is true but (normally) unsurprising.\n\nOn top of this, Ponytail seems to have not been aware of the passing of two whole election cycles as the discussion focuses upon {{w|Barack Obama}}, the President before Presidents Trump and Biden, who left office 7 (!) years before this comic, on January 20th, 2017. Ponytail states that she liked him, and wonders if he'll be up for taking on the position again. But Cueball states that he ''can't'' be made President again, having already served two terms, which Ponytail confirms by checking for herself the details of the {{w|Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution}}.\n\nIn the second half of the comic Cueball and Ponytail discuss whether Obama is even the same person seven years after he was last president. Like the mythical {{w|Ship of Theseus}}, mentioned by Ponytail, which gradually had all of its parts replaced over many years, most of Obama's constituent cells have been replaced since he was last president. Ponytail is thus looking into the possibility of Obama's re-election based upon philosophical/biological technicalities (as applied to the Constitution's words), rather than as legal/political convention might normally suggest. \n\nCueball questions if the cell replacement isn't a myth, and at least some cells may remain the same, especially those making up the enamel in the teeth, which he believes has a half-life of over 30 years, meaning that even after 30 years only half of the cells in your enamel have been replaced. \n\nBut even when Ponytail's approach is seen to be wanting, requiring a wait significantly exceeding 30 years, Ponytail suggests negating that issue by having all of Obama's teeth removed and replaced with false teeth.\n\nIn order to facilitate the latter goal, Ponytail announces her intention to consult both a dentist (presumably for getting the teeth replaced) and a lawyer (perhaps to establish that Obama could thus run for president again, hopefully in advance). Although, in Ponytail's frame of mind, it could also be to consult with the dentist to clear up the currently theoretical issues about tooth-biology, and the lawyer might be asked to serve an enforcement notice to force Obama to undergo the 'treatment'.\n\nSeeing where her current misplaced, and {{w|Dunningâ€“Kruger effect|less than informed}}, zeal might be leading her, Cueball appears to be about to suggest that the {{w|Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court }} is about to pre-emptively block her plan, but instead turns out, in a play on the word 'block', to be saying that they will be unanimous in blocking her phone number so that she cannot contact them again, suggesting that this just the latest in a string of ridiculous proposals she has attempted to bring before them, and they have finally lost patience. The Supreme Court being unanimous on any issue is now a [https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/07/as-unanimity-declines-conservative-majoritys-power-runs-deeper-than-the-blockbuster-cases/ comparatively rare event].<!-- I looked for a decent post-2021 summary, but could not find one, perhaps someone else could check and replace/rephrase if they can establish better search engine skills-->\n\nAlthough Cueball (and thus [[Randall]]) seems to think the suggestion has no merit, it is public knowledge that Randall did [https://blog.xkcd.com/2008/01/28/obama/ endorse Obama] and in [[1756: I'm With Her]], he again showed that he prefers Democratic Presidents at least over [[Donald Trump]]. That he is not happy about Trump has been obvious in many comics ([[2220: Imagine Going Back in Time]] for an example), and Trump might be running for president again, in this election year, so it is not unlikely that Randall would wish that it was possible to get Obama back as president if in any way possible.\n\nThe title text combines two {{w|George Washington}} references.  The first part of the sentence is the beginning of the mundane but true claim that \"It wasn't originally constitutionally required, but presidents who have served two terms have traditionally followed George Washington's example and not sought a third term.\"  However, the title text veers off-course to the subject of {{w|George Washington's teeth|George Washington's (in)famous 'false teeth'}}. Washington's dentures are often falsely claimed to be made of wood; in truth they were ''real'' teeth procured from other sources. Regardless, this would have likely resolved the rather specific philosophical/legal problems established in the comic, were they real.  However, since Washington only ran for president twice, even if the 22nd amendment had been in effect, it would have been unnecessary!\n\nIt goes almost without saying that no one has yet even ''attempted'' to carry out this plan. Only one President has exceeded the 2-term limit; {{w|Franklin D. Roosevelt}} died in office during his ''fourth'' term, but he served prior to the 22nd Amendment and was thus unaffected by the rule, which was enacted six years after his death. (FDR did have a partial denture, but given that he retained some of his natural teeth, he did not engage in Ponytail's proposed scheme.) Presidents since then have definitely ([[Definitely|and sometimes defiantly]]) tried various schemes aimed at securing a second term, with both successes and failures, but nobody has yet attempted ''this particular plan'' to achieve a third or beyond. Or at least one can assume that those that perhaps did (including, as noted, all those who were not yet 'required' to go to these lengths) failed to attain their goals for entirely different reasons.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Ponytail and Cueball are walking.]\n:Ponytail: So this is 2024.\n:Cueball: Yup. Guess it's an election year now.\n:Ponytail: Again? Man, those just keep happening, huh?\n\n:[Ponytail and Cueball stop walking and Cueball has turned to face Ponytail.]\n:Ponytail: Who's the president these days, anyway? Is it still Obama?\n:Cueball: What? No? He hasn't been... How do you not...\n\n:[Ponytail and Cueball standing.]\n:Ponytail: Darn, I liked him. Is he running this time?\n:Cueball: No, he's not allowed to.\n:Ponytail: He's not? Why?\n:Cueball: Constitution.\n\n:[Zoom in on the upper part of Ponytail who checks her smartphone held up in one hand. The text she is reading on her phone is shown in a square speech bubble above her head, with a jagged thin snip from the speech bubble extending from it down to above her smartphone.]\n:Phone: ''Amendment 22''\n:Phone: No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice\n:Ponytail: What?? C'mon...\n\n:[Ponytail has raised her hand palm up towards Cueball.]\n:Ponytail: Don't all your cells get replaced every seven years, Ship of Theseus-style? Is he even the same person?\n:Ponytail: Maybe \"no person shall be elected more than twice\" isn't a prohibition, it's more of an observation, like \"you can't step in the same river twice.\"\n\n:[Zoom in on the upper part of Cueball.]\n:Cueball: Isn't the cell thing a myth?\n:Cueball: I think tooth enamel has a turnover half-life of 30+ years. His teeth molecules are probably the same.\n\n:[Ponytail has turned around and walks away from Cueball with a finger raised high.]\n:Ponytail: So if Obama just gets false teeth, he can run again! I need to talk to a dentist and a lawyer!\n:Cueball: The Supreme Court is about to vote 9-0 to block your number.\n\n==Trivia==\n*This is the first [[:Category:New Year|New Year comic]] using the year as the title since 2018. \n**That was a break of six years after having [[:Category:Comics sharing name|used this kind of title]] for all even years between [[998: 2012|2012]] and [[1935: 2018|2018]] plus also in [[1779: 2017|2017]].\n**So five times in seven years and then five years in a row without doing so.\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:New Year]]\n[[Category:Comics sharing name|2024]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Elections]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]"
