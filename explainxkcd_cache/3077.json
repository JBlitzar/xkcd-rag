He is best known for formulating the definition of a {{w|de Sitter space}}, which has constant positive (elliptic) curvature, where the sum of the internal angles of any {{w|Triangle#Triangle in non-planar space|triangle}} is more than 180°, and lines that initially appear parallel will always meet; the surface of a sphere is an example of a two-dimensional de Sitter space.\n\nIn contrast, an {{w|anti-de Sitter space}} is a space that has constant negative (hyperbolic) spatial curvature, where the sum of the internal angles of any triangle is less than 180°, and two parallel lines will diverge when extended. An anti-de Sitter space is a theoretical space with strange curves and extra dimensions which is used in studying the space-time structure of the universe.\n\nThe caption \"My house is an anti-de Sitter space\" refers instead to being against the actual physicist {{w|Willem de Sitter}}, after whom both spatial geometries are named, because the speaker forbids de Sitter from entering their house. This prohibition is pointless since he died in 1934.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|conformal field theory}}, a set of rules for how tiny particles behave on boundaries. The ideas of conformal field theory and anti-de Sitter space are closely linked: everything in an anti-de Sitter space has a parallel in conformal field theory, a property which is usually called the anti-de Sitter space/conformal field theory correspondence or {{w|AdS/CFT correspondence}} for short. The extra pun here is \"{{wiktionary|correspondence}}\" also meaning \"mutual communication or discourse\", typically communication by letter or email.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A large note is taped to a closed door, which has a doorknob with a keyhole on it. The note reads:]\n:20th century Dutch physicist Willem de Sitter is '''''not''''' welcome here\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:My house is an anti-de Sitter space.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]"
