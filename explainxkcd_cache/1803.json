For various reasons these sites often find themselves with pages dedicated to, as [[Randall]] puts it, \"places that really don't need reviews\" such as government buildings, construction sites, and even entire [https://www.cntraveler.com/story/google-maps-reviews-of-entire-continents-are-bizarre-and-hilarious continents].\n\nRandall is poking fun at this phenomenon by inventing possible reviews for the (fictional) location ''Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility'', depicted with a {{w|Google Map|Google Maps}}-styled map page along with a series of so-called reviews. (There does exist a {{w|Canyon River (Ontario)|Canyon River}} located in {{w|Ontario}}/{{w|Canada}} and one in {{w|Washington (state)|Washington}}/USA (the latter is a significant tributary to the {{w|Satsop River}}). Canada does not maintain nuclear weapons since 1984, so such a launch site would be located in Washington). \n\nSee explanations for the [[#Trivia|11 visible]] (out of 22) reviews in the [[#Reviews|table below]]. Of course those responsible for such a facility with {{w|nuclear missiles}} would not like the attention they would be getting in this way, especially not when one of the comments mentions a hole in the fence... Although this comic makes a joke about reviews it has chosen a very dangerous facility to joke about.\n\nIn the title text Randall mentions that both Google and Yelp keep deleting his scathing reviews of several locations like the above. The questions is if they would have done it if they had not been so harsh... While Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility appears not to exist, the places/phenomena he lists in the title text certainly do, and are places that you either cannot or would not normally visit as destinations. Here below each \"location\" is explained. That the deletion of such reviews is real has been proven by this comic, as [[#Trivia|it also happened]] for those that (of course) posted these reviews on Google maps as a response to this comic.\n\n{{w|Mariana Trench}} is the deepest area of the world's oceans, about 10,994 meters (36,070 ft) deep, located between Japan and Australia. The pressure in the Mariana Trench is about 1,086 bars, more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure of about 1 bar at sea level. Despite this enormous pressure some organisms {{w|Mariana_Trench#Life|live in the Mariana Trench}}. Humans can reach the ground only by special deep-sea submarines, like Jacques Piccard did in 1960 with the {{w|Bathyscaphe Trieste}}. See reviews for the Mariana Trench at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mariana+Trench/@17.75,142.4978113,17z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x67328f3cd57de715:0x1bbe64e7a21aa7fc!8m2!3d17.75!4d142.5!9m1!1b1?hl=en Google Maps] and [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Marianengraben/108402422518280 Facebook].\n\nThe {{w|Chernobyl}} reactor core is the most dangerous part of the {{w|Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant}}. It is located in the North of Ukraine. In the reactor No. 4 there was a nuclear disaster that happened on 26 April 1986. It caused devastating damage and massive radioactive contamination. There is still a {{w|Chernobyl Exclusion Zone}} 30 kilometers around the power plant. See reviews for the Chernobyl power plant at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chernobyl+Nuclear+Plant/@51.3852262,30.1003411,15z/data=!4m14!1m6!3m5!1s0x472a7d09e1ec5ef3:0x6b27a13ab968d17c!2sChernobyl+Nuclear+Plant!8m2!3d51.3889447!4d30.0988421!3m6!1s0x472a7d09e1ec5ef3:0x6b27a13ab968d17c!8m2!3d51.3889447!4d30.0988421!9m1!1b1?hl=en Google Maps] and [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kernkraftwerk-Tschernobyl/118179298239715?rf=116556918391753 Facebook].\n\n{{w|Jet stream}}s are a meteorologic phenomenon about 9 to 16 kilometers above the ground. A stream consists of air currents with speeds from 92 km/h (50 kn; 57 mph) to over 398 km/h (215 kn; 247 mph). Such jet streams are routinely used for reducing fuel usage for long distance plane travels. As it is a ribbon rather than a point, it could not have a single point on the map. Also, the jet stream fluctuates north and south; so even if it could be pinpointed, the location would be constantly changing.\n\nThe {{w|equator}} is, as with the jet streams, not a singular place but a circumference around the Earth. Reviewing the equator as a singular location is rather pointless ([[No Pun Intended|no pun intended]]), though there is a whole range of specific (and interesting) locations around the equator, with countries with {{w|tropical rainforest climate}}, which many people from European and North American countries struggle with. That said, most of the equator goes over water.\n\n===Reviews===\nIn the table the rating is given with the review. After that an explanation both of the rating and of the review is given. Notice that any or all of the reviews could be sarcastic or \"trolling\", as is fairly typical on the internet, especially for reviews given for such a location as this one. This table assumes all the reviews are played straight. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Rating\n! Review\n! Explanation\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★★★★</span> || Greatest country on earth || A patriotic review (5/5), though one providing no information on the actual nuclear site. This comment is such as would come from an extremely patriotic person, who believes that the United States is the greatest country on Earth, and therefore is pleased that the country is being protected by nuclear weapons.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★☆☆☆</span> || Looks cool but you can't get in || This reviewer, although initially positive, attempts to highlight what they perceive as a major flaw with the site: namely, that it is off-limits to unauthorized personnel and heavily guarded, so it's impossible to actually go inside (thus only 2/5 stars). This is typical of a nuclear facility,{{Citation needed}} but this kind of review could also be seen for a fancy restaurant that needs very early pre-booking.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★☆☆☆☆</span> || What is this store || Reviewer really, really has no idea what this facility actually is, mistaking it for a store, and thus giving it only 1 star.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★★★☆</span> || My cousin worked here || If true, this review is a serious security risk (e.g. kidnapping the reviewer to extort information from his cousin). The comment may also just be a way for the reviewer to pretend he knows someone who works in the higher levels of the government. Usually this kind of comment together with a four star rating is to signal that you know more about the location than a regular reviewer does. Of course, you could then also be perceived as partial.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★☆☆☆</span> || Waitstaff heavily armed and very rude || This review mistakes the facility's security guards for a restaurant's waitstaff. Since the guards are protecting some of the most dangerous weapons in existence, and would not let unknown outsiders into the facility, it follows that they would be heavily armed, and quite rude to those who sought entry without proper permission. Moreover, nuclear weapons are generally not food-safe.{{Citation needed}} Thus they earn the place only 2 stars.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★☆☆☆☆</span> || Stop doing chemtrails || This reviewer believes in the {{w|chemtrail conspiracy theory}} and is urging the government to cease spreading the chemtrails. Believing this place has something to do with chemtrail spraying of course leads to only one star. This conspiracy was earlier mentioned both in [[966: Jet Fuel]] and [[1677: Contrails]], and later in [[2654: Chemtrails]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★☆☆☆☆</span> || This place is a symptom of the {{w|military-industrial complex}} strangling our democracy and...<span style=\"color: gray;\">(read full review-1184 words)</span> || A slightly tongue-in-cheek reference to essays against 'The Military-Industrial Complex' and how they are often copy-pasted by people who don't really understand them in inappropriate places. Or just to people who write rants far longer than anything that most people would ever read, except those who already agree with the writer. Of course such an activist would only give one star.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★★★☆</span> || Anyone else notice the hole in the west fence? || The adventurer's travel guide to government installations... Posting a comment like this would (at best) bring the hole to the attention of the site staff to be repaired and (at worst) bring the writer unwelcome attention from the authorities for publicizing a security vulnerability at a missile site.  This might also be a reference to {{w|Richard Feynman}}'s account of finding and using a hole in the fence surrounding the {{w|Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos}} facility during the {{w|Manhattan Project}}. Using the hole to get in, this reviewer had an excellent time and gives 4/5 stars.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★★★★</span> || Whoa, missiles! || The writer is impressed and apparently surprised to discover that the site has missiles. Seems like the reviewer just loves anything to do with missiles and hands out five stars. This may also be a reference to the \"Whoa, technology!\" meme, which originated when YandereDev, a Youtuber best known for his work on the infamous {{w|Yandere Simulator}}, uttered the phrase in one of his videos.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★★★☆☆</span> || Good idea but confusing web site. How do I preorder? || This reviewer thinks that one can order a nuclear missile launch here, but can't find a preorder form on the website. He loves the idea but since he cannot find out how to order there are only 3/5 stars. In reality, the decision to launch nuclear missiles often rests with the heads of state or government, and outside persons are not  allowed to control them.{{Citation needed}}\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">★☆☆☆☆</span> || Please don't launch these || A plea to the facility owners not to launch the nuclear missiles, due to their deleterious effects on human life.\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Inside the main panel there is a frame with a Google location map with the typical red pin stuck in the center of the map inside a large gray region of the map.
