He wrote the book ''Contact'', which was later made into the movie by the same name. While Sagan did not emit anomalous radiation in his lifetime,{{Citation Needed}} he did receive acclaim in the field of radiology, namely for using radiation to synthesize amino acids from simpler chemicals.\n\nThis comic is parodying {{w|Spider-Man}}, in which Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider to become Spider-Man. In this comic \"a radioactive Carl Sagan\" turns the person into \"Sagan-Man\". Apparently, Sagan-Man is able to stop thieves in their tracks by blowing their minds with inspiring scientific facts.\n\nThe title text implies that Sagan-Man's vivid imagery inspires the entire \"criminal class\" to give up their anti-social ways and turn to space research.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A yellow box extends across the top of the first 3 of 5 panels, introducing Sagan-Man:]\n:Bitten by a radioactive Carl Sagan in 1995, Sagan-Man possesses the powers and abilities of Carl Sagan.\n:[A Cueball-like character is standing on the left side of the panel, with a victim off-panel to the right.]\n:Victim (off-panel): Help!
