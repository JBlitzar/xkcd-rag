If someone thinks that a device has achieved its goal they shut it down. After an idea or product that people think is well made is created people will joke that the process that created it should be shut down, as if the process has achieved its ultimate purpose. This is most often used sarcastically for an inferior product or idea. Taking things literally is a common theme in the xkcd comics.\n\nCurly-hair sits at a computer anxiously and nervously writing a message to someone they care about deeply, possibly a child to be adopted or a romantic interest. Curly-hair plans on saving enough money to have the person flown to their location from \"half a world away.\" Curly-hair ends the message with a promise to communicate daily until the two are able to meet. When attempting to send the message, however, Curly-hair discovers that their internet connection is down and the message goes unsent.\n\n[[Ponytail]] explains there was a \"ridiculous video\" to which someone had commented \"That's it. Shut down the Internet. We're done.\" This was taken literally and, because enough people agreed with this comment, the internet was shut down and Curly-hair was left unable to communicate with their love.\n\nThe joke being that the internet was creating something far more valuable between Curly-hair and their love than a ridiculous video, thus highlighting the beautiful and far reaching potential impact of the internet. The likelihood of the entire internet being shut down based on a single comment being vanishingly low adds to the humor.\n\nIn the final panel Curly-hair states wistfully that they were not done with the internet. The title text is Ponytail's response, which asserts Ponytail's belief that Curly-hair's message could not be important because the Facebook comment asserted that nothing of any significance could come from the internet after the ridiculous video.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Writer (typing): I had started to think I was asking too much, that I needed to settle. And then I found you half a world away.\n\n:Writer (typing): I've been saving money. Six months from now, I'll be able to fly you here and support us for a while.\n\n:Writer (typing): It's a long wait, but we'll talk every day until then. Maybe this won't work out, but I want to try. What do you think?\n\n:Computer: '''ERROR''': Your message could not be sent.\n:''[Refresh]''\n:Computer: '''ERROR''': No connection.\n:Writer: ??\n\n:Writer: Why can't I connect?\n:Ponytail: Someone saw a ridiculous video and said \"That's it. Shut down the Internet. We're done.\" So they did.\n\n:Writer: ...But... I wasn't done.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Internet]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
