Truman}}, who was US President between 1945 and 1953. [[Megan]] notes that both of these presidents' last names start with \"T-R-U-M\", but she also states that they are not related.\n\nThere were several presidents of the US who even have the exact same last name. For example, {{w|John Adams}} and his son {{w|John Quincy Adams}}, and the more recent father and son {{w|George H. W. Bush}} and {{w|George W. Bush}}. Similarly {{w|Theodore Roosevelt}} and {{w|Franklin Delano Roosevelt}} are 5th cousins. Grandfather and grandson {{w|William Henry Harrison}} and {{w|Benjamin Harrison}} also share a last name.  And there are the two [https://www.geni.com/path/Lyndon-B-Johnson-36th-President-of-the-United-States+is+related+to+Andrew-Johnson-17th-President-of-the-USA?from=6000000002045454764&to=361204095530004567| most distantly related] presidents with the same surname, both {{w|Andrew Johnson}} and {{w|Lyndon B. Johnson}} have the last name of Johnson (7 letters), although the shared last name is coincidental, given they do not share any relatives with the name Johnson.\n\nBesides T-R-U-M- and the cases of identical names, the longest common surname prefix is H-A-R (3 letters), shared by William Henry (or Benjamin) H-A-R-rison and Warren Gamaliel H-A-R-ding. If Kamala Harris had prevailed in the 2024 presidential election, she would have brought the record up to 6 letters, sharing her entire last name with the first six letters of the two Harrisons. (The next longest common surname prefixes are B-U-, shared by James B-U-chanan and George (H.) W. Bush; and C-L-, shared by Grover Cleveland and Bill Clinton.). The longest common suffix (not counting identical names) is also 4 for I-S-O-N for {{w|James Madison}} and the two Harrison presidents. Interestingly, the name HARRISON contains both the second-longest common prefix and the longest common suffix among non-identical president surnames.\n\nThe joke is that the matching of those few letters is the least weird thing. Trump's presidency is commonly considered weird in ways too varied to concisely list in this article. Both Megan and Cueball seem to agree on this.\n\nThe title text lists \"absurd\" last names that could start with the same letters as other presidents: Bill Eisenhamper, Amy Forb, Ethan Obample, and Abigail Washingtoast. These would refer to {{w|Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. '''Eisenh'''ower}}, {{w|Gerald Ford|Gerald '''For'''d}}, {{w|Barack Obama|Barack '''Obam'''a}}, and {{w|George Washington|George '''Washingto'''n}}.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan walking together while talking.]\n:Megan: It's pretty weird that we've had two totally unrelated presidents whose last names start with '''''\"T-R-U-M-\"'''''.\n:Cueball: Oh, sure, that's ''definitely'' the weirdest thing about the presidency right now.\n:Megan: It's less weird than '''''every other fact'''''. But still weird.\n:Cueball: True.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Politics]]"
