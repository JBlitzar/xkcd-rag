Originally designed to study the outer planets of the {{w|Solar System}}, it is now several decades into an extended mission beyond Neptune (see [[#Trivia]]). The Voyager probe has made history for passing many milestones of our solar system. \n\nWhen images are compressed by a {{w|lossy compression}} format (e.g. {{w|JPEG}}), visual artifacts are created. Randall here is suggesting that the probe has passed the artifacts as if the artifacts were an actual feature of the solar system rather than a consequence of our technology.  The banding lines he has drawn are commonly seen in old images with low bit depth.\n\nThe 'solar system' in the snapshot appears to be a 4-bit greyscale-plane at a more pixelated level than the image given. It contains 16 'banded' levels from the brightest (closest zones, within this image, to the Sun) to darkest (the furthest illustrated expanses, including interstellar space), with irregular or non-trivial transitional edges but no obvious or dominant dithering/speckling or 'noise'. The Voyager image (and track) is overlaid in a white 'line drawing' format.\n\nEach apparent pixel in this low-res rendering is approximately 1 AUÂ², where 1 AU ({{w|astronomical unit}}) is the distance from the Sun to the earth. The Sun is off the left side of the image by about 30 pixels, meaning that of all the planets in the solar system, only Neptune would have an orbit that is within the image at all (at the left edge). The {{w|heliosphere}} is 120 AU from the sun, in the direction that Voyager 1 is travelling: Voyager crossed that milestone in August 2012. At time of publication Voyager was just over 150 AU from the Sun, as shown in the image.\n\nContinuing on its course at 38,000 mph, or 3.6 AU/year, Voyager will reach the outer edge of the {{w|Oort cloud}}, the edge of our solar system, in about 300 years.\n\nThe title text refers to 'our spacetime {{w|codec}}', suggesting a representation of reality itself as a series of ones and zeros. If empty space is the darkest possible thing that can be represented--which may be the case when only 16 levels are available (see above)--then it is possible that {{w|dark matter}} is ''so'' dark that it cannot be represented: it would require a negative number, which is not available. This is the {{w|dynamic range}} issue mentioned.\n\nThe title text may also be a pun on the term \"{{w|Render}}\", as the codec's issues would both make cause the dark matter to be undetectable and, in the metaphor of the universe as a simulation, literally fail to render the \"pixels\" in the dark matter. This is the play on the term \"Render\" having multiple definitions, both meaning \"To cause to become\" and being the term in computing for \"Transforming (a model) into a display on the screen or other media\", as per {{wiktionary|render#English|Wikitionary}}.\n\nArtefacts are evident in [[1683: Digital Data]], and mentioned in the title text of [[331: Photoshops]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Irregular bands of gray are shown, shading from a white circular segment on the lower left side of the panel to completely black on the right. The bands have pixelated edges. A small white space probe is shown just outside the last dark gray band, in the completely black area. A dotted line starting from inside the dark gray area and ending at the space probe indicates that it is moving to the right, out of the gray area. Close to the white area, there are many bands packed closely together and with hard to define edges. But there are five gray areas clearly separated from the white, with a tendency to be elongated in the space probe's direction.]\n\n:[Caption below the panel]: Milestone: ''Voyager'' has passed through the streaming video compression artifacts that mark the edge of the solar system\n\n==Trivia==\n* At the time of the fly-by of {{w|Neptune}}, in 1989, it was the outermost of the nine officially recognised planets.\n* The more highly eliptical orbit of {{w|Pluto}}, which was also unfavourably positioned for any Voyager mission encounter, meant that it would be another ten years before it was the actual outermost planet, well behind the respective Voyager crafts' progress away from the Sun.\n* Pluto was then 'demoted' from being a full planet in 2005, meaning that Neptune officially became the outermost of the (eight) planets, well in advance of the next orbital 'switch' (roughly in the 2220s to 2240s) when Pluto's path would bring it closer to the Sun once more.\n* However Pluto (and partner bodies/'moons') finally experienced its own {{w|New Horizons|fly-by mission}} in 2015, which ''may'' perhaps have softened some of the psychological blow from the various snubs it had experienced over the prior decades.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Space probes]]"
