It is a list of Wikipedia article titles that are in the same syllable-stress pattern as the first line of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS-qFdw-v_o theme song] of the {{w|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 cartoon series}}.\n\nThe list is compiled in alphabetical order from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of the items on this list (e.g. ''{{w|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective}}'') are drawn as headlines in the same style as the logo from that series. These articles are not in alphabetical order with the surrounding small face text, but these headlines are in alphabetical order with the other headlines from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of these phrases are not actually the titles of Wikipedia articles, but are redirects. For instance, the article on {{w|Woodrow Wilson \"Woody\" Guthrie}} redirects to {{w|Woody Guthrie}}, and {{w|Former Arctic Monkeys members}} at one time redirected to {{w|Andy Nicholson}}.\n\nThe syllable-stress pattern of this line is long-short-long-short-long-short-long-short, known in poetry as {{w|trochaic tetrameter}}. Randall has previously authored comics dealing with {{w|trochees}}, namely [[856: Trochee Fixation]] and [[1383: Magic Words]].\n\nA similar idea was performed by {{w|Jimmy Fallon}} in 2001 at a [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jimmy+fallon+80s+medley concert for New York city] where he demonstrated singing \"any 80's song\" over the tune of {{w|MC Hammer}}'s song \"{{w|U Can't Touch This}}\".\n\nThe title text suggests an album of songs (''{{w|The Purple People Eater}}'', the aforementioned ''Ninja Turtles'' theme, ''{{w|Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini}}'' and the ''{{w|Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers}}'' theme), the title or primary refrain of which have a large number of verses in {{w|trochee|trochaic}} {{w|meter (poetry)|meter}}. Randall suggests that these refrains are so interchangeable that the lyrics of each could be sung to the melody of the song following it in the tracklist. Randall would title the album ''{{w|Linked List}}'' as each song would melodically reference the next song. The refrains of the songs, respectively are:\n*\"One-eyed, one-horned flying purple people eater\"\n*\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"\n*\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\"\n*\"Go go Power Rangers\"\n\nIn 2019 a [https://twitter.com/wiki_tmnt Twitter feed was created] which identifies Wikipedia articles with this stress pattern and creates a matching graphic.\n\n==The Wikipedia links==\n\nThere are 6 headlines and 9 other article links in each block next to a headline for a total of 60 wiki links:\n\n:;{{w|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective}}\n:{{w|Biggest Loser: Second Chances}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Cayman Island blue iguana}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Central Texas pocket gopher}}\n:{{w|Church of Jesus Christ Creator}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Climate change and meat production}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon}}\n:{{w|Daylight saving time in China}} (renamed, but still works)\n:{{w|Denver Airport People Mover}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Easter Island spiny lobster}} (now renamed)\n\n:;{{w|Asian Human Rights Commission}}\n:{{w|Edgar Allan Poe Museum}}\n:{{w|Engine failure after take-off}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|English as a second language}} (now renamed)\n:<s>{{w|Former Arctic Monkeys members}}</s> (deleted)\n:{{w|Fowler's Modern English Usage}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Georgia Game and Fish Department}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Golden-mantled howler monkey}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Greater Cleveland Film Commission}}\n:{{w|Hairy flower chafer beetle}} (now renamed)\n\n:;{{w|San Diego City Council}}\n:{{w|Harland David \"Colonel\" Sanders}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Human Tissue Resource Network}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Klondike-class destroyer tender|Klondike class destroyer tender}}\n:{{w|Legal code of North Dakota}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Lesser knapweed flower weevil}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Lockheed Martin Atlas rocket}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Maple syrup urine syndrome}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers}}\n:{{w|Nablus mask-like facial syndrome}}\n\n:;{{w|Single payer health insurance}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Neo Geo Pocket Color}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|New Year's Eve with Carson Daly}} (merged under new name)\n:{{w|Newton's second law of motion}} (merged under new name)\n:{{w|North Korean Workers Party}} (now renamed)\n:<s>{{w|Orange County Business Council}}</s> (deleted)\n:{{w|Over/under cable coiling}} (merged under new name)\n:{{w|Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater}} \n:{{w|Places named for Adolf Hitler}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Proton-proton chain reaction}} (now renamed)\n\n:;{{w|Spotted giant flying squirrel}}\n:{{w|Puerto Rican lizard-cuckoo}}\n:{{w|Quantum vacuum plasma thruster}}<ref>See also [[1404: Quantum Vacuum Virtual Plasma]].</ref> (rendered as \"Quantuum\", in the comic) (now renamed, anyway)\n:{{w|Rocky Mountain spotted fever}}\n:{{w|Royal Flying Doctor Service}}\n:{{w|Russian Women's Fascist Movement}}\n:{{w|Semi-active laser guidance}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers}}\n:{{w|Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows}}\n:{{w|Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon}}\n\n:;{{w|Women science fiction authors}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Trailing suction hopper dredger}}\n:{{w|Vector graphics markup language}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Viti Levu giant pigeon}}\n:{{w|Voting rights in Puerto Rico}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|William Henry, Duke of Gloucester}}<ref>Gloucester is pronounced /ˈglɒstər/ (gloster).</ref> (now renamed)\n:{{w|Windows Vista startup process}} (now renamed)\n:{{w|Woodrow Wilson \"Woody\" Guthrie}}\n:{{w|Yaba monkey tumor virus}}\n:{{w|Zack and Miri Make a Porno}}\n\n===Notes===\n\n<references/>\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[Caption above comic]\n:;WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE TITLES\n::With the right syllable stress pattern to be sung to the tune of the original ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' theme song\n\n:[Six groups of Wikipedia article titles are written out.
