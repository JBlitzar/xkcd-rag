Jupiter's largest moon {{w|Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede}} is not shown, but its gravitational pull affects the ''Clipper's'' trajectory. A mission goal is to achieve a 6:1 {{w|orbital resonance}} with Europa [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Ozimek/publication/383115312_AAS_24-433_Europa_Clipper_Mission_Analysis_Pump_Down_Trajectory_Design/links/66bcd845311cbb094938dbd6/AAS-24-433-Europa-Clipper-Mission-Analysis-Pump-Down-Trajectory-Design.pdf by September 2034]. ]]\n\nThe ''{{w|Europa Clipper}}'' space probe was launched from the {{w|Kennedy Space Center}} in Florida on [https://europa.nasa.gov/mission/about/ October 14, 2024]. It is expected to arrive at Jupiter and begin exploration of Jupiter's moons, particularly {{w|Europa (moon)|Europa}}, in April of 2030. \n\nEuropa is an icy moon. Water ice covers its surface. Around 15 to 25 kilometers (10 to 15 miles) beneath the ice, there is expected to be liquid water which may contain some [https://europa.nasa.gov/why-europa/ingredients-for-life/ basic forms of life]. To sample this liquid, its icy crust would need to be breached. The thickness of the ice dwarfs the ''Europa Clipper's'' 31 meter span.\n\nEuropa's surface of ice over liquid water could be loosely compared to the caramelized crust on the popular dessert {{w|crème brûlée}}&mdash;a comparison that may have been prompted because the {{w|Cassini-Huygens}} probe, after landing on Saturn's moon Titan in January of 2005, found that its surface had what was described as [https://www.sciencenews.org/article/world-unveiled-cr%C3%A8me-br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e-titan a \"crème brûlée\" consistency]. The hard surface of the caramel cream dessert is traditionally cracked open with a {{w|Tableware#Spoon|spoon}}, so [[Randall]] jokes that such equipment will be deployed by the ''Europa Clipper''.\n\nIn truth, no such spoon is present on the probe, and Europa's icy crust is too thick to be penetrated by a spoon of such size. Advanced measures are needed to prevent contamination of liquid water by Earth's organisms such as {{w|tardigrade}}s, {{w|deinococcus radiodurans}}, or {{w|bacillus subtilis}}. The ''Europa Clipper's'' course has been charted to avoid any contact with the surface of Europa (although it will fly through some sparse material it ejects into space) so as to prevent {{w|Planetary protection|contamination by microorganisms from Earth}}.\n\nThe successful deployment of any spacecraft's instrument is considered a cause for celebration because deployable spacecraft instruments often fail to correctly extend, unfurl or undock. The ''Clipper'' has a magnetometer that will be used at the end of a 8.5 meter boom (not apparent in the comic which, spoon extension aside, is an otherwise fairly accurate depiction) as part of its study of the moons' environment.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 1em 0;\">\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 1em;\">\n    [[File:Europa_-_Perijove_45_(cropped).png|200px|alt=Europa]]\n    <div>Europa</div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 1em;\">\n    [[File:2014_0531_Crème_brûlée_Doi_Mae_Salong_(cropped).jpg|200px|alt=Crème brûlée]]\n    <div>Crème brûlée</div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 1em;\">\n    [[File:Europa_Clipper_spacecraft_model.png|200px|alt=The Europa Clipper spacecraft]]\n    <div>The ''Europa Clipper'' spacecraft</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nThe title text expands on the joke by stating that the spacecraft \"had BETTER\" return samples of Europa to Earth. However, the ''Europa Clipper'' is not a {{w|sample-return mission}}, and if it were, such samples are unlikely to be good to eat.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[A space probe with two rectangular solar panels, a circular dish on the front, and a very large spoon extending beneath, longer than the span of both solar panels]\n\n:[Below the panel:]\n:Good news: NASA's '''''Europa Clipper''''' is en route to Europa and has successfully deployed its crème brûlée spoon.\n\n==Trivia==\nInitially, the ''Europa Clipper'' mission was planned to include a lander component, but it was removed from the project early on. The Europa Lander proposal lags significantly behind the Clipper in development and has not secured funding. An actual sample return mission is currently far into the future of {{w|Ocean Worlds Exploration Program|the pertinent plans for exploration}}.\n\nIn {{w|Arthur C. Clarke}}'s novel ''{{w|2010: Odyssey Two}}'', the monolith aliens tell humanity ''\"All these worlds are yours &mdash; except Europa. Attempt no landing there.\"'' Contrary to the suggestion of the comic, no landing or any other physical interaction beyond observation of the surface and analysis of the ejecta of Europa is planned.\n\nIn {{w|Greek mythology}}, {{w|Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa}} was a {{w|Phoenician}} princess whom {{w|Zeus}}, the king of the gods, abducted after transforming himself into a bull. The name of the continent Europe may derive from this legend, though alternative theories suggest it originates from ancient Greek words meaning \"wide-gazing\" or \"broad face.\" Additionally, there is an {{w|Oceanid}} named {{w|Europa (Greek myth)|Europa}} (with a sister named {{w|Asia (Oceanid)|Asia}}), one of the many daughters of the {{w|Titans}}, {{w|Oceanus}} and {{w|Tethys (mythology)|Tethys}}. The name Europa is also used in {{w|Europa (Greek myth)|other mythological}} and {{w|Europa (Roman province)|geographical}} contexts. Jupiter's moon Europa was named after the Phoenician princess, following the tradition of naming Jovian moons after Zeus's lovers. \n\nDiacritics are previously featured in comic [[1647: Diacritics]] and [[2619: Crêpe]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Space]]\n[[Category:Space probes]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
