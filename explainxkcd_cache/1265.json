However, in this case, instead of actual fruits or vegetables, someone is making juice from {{w|Fruit Gushers}}, a chewy fruit-flavored candy, thereby extracting a nearly nutritionless artificial \"juice\" out of a candy casing which was formulated specifically for human consumption.\n\nThis may or may not be a parody of \"Fruit Gushers\" television commercials, in which Fruit Gushers are shown to squirt out nearly limitless amounts of \"juice\" that was released around the time of upload.\n\nThe title text asserts that the rind is where all the {{w|Vitamin|vitamins}} in the fruit reside. This is a common belief of actual fruits, although it is an untrue {{w|urban legend}} for many fruits; even fruits like apples do not contain most of the {{w|fiber}} in the skin itself, but rather directly below; although when you peel an apple you remove more than just the skin, losing also some high fiber content anyway. It is absolutely absurd as in this case, though, as the \"rind\" of a Fruit Gusher consists mainly of sugar. This text mocks the usual sentiment that the less desirable part of a food is the part that is \"better\" for you.\n\nIt is also a parody of the notion that buying a juicer, or other things like exercise equipment, will automatically make people healthier. Here it is shown that what you do with the juicer is the relevant factor. It is a little hidden joke that there is way more red than blue, pointing out how Gushers always have more red than blue. \n\nThe comic can also be interpreted as parodying the idea of fruit juices being healthy. Though this is widely believed, [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/making-the-case-for-eating-fruit/ studies from 2013] [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/some-fruits-are-better-than-others/ demonstrate otherwise.]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[We see a shelf. On it, from left to right, are: a bag of fruit gushers; a juicer; a bottle of bright red liquid; a bottle of bright blue liquid; and another bottle of bright red liquid.]\n:\"Oh yeah, juicers are great! I use mine all the time.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*An alternative reading that expands on that theme is that the comic shows a juicer with three full bottles of real juice, indicating that the owner of the juice machine is making regular juice with the intention of drinking it, but not consuming juice at the rate it is produced. The comic also shows a Fruit Gusher snack, indicating the unhealthy option that the juicer owner just can't stop eating. But the color of the juices makes the first explanation more likely.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Food]]"
