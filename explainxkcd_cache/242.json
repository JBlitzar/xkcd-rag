A bolt of lightning comes down and strikes him.\n\nAfter being dazed for a moment, the comic then takes one of two routes; the first is that of a normal person, the second that of a scientist.\n\nIn [[Randall]]'s example, the normal person would decide not to pull the lever anymore, because it seems to cause him to get struck by a bolt of lightning.\n\nBut the scientist would pull the lever again to see if it was just a coincidence or if the lever actually caused the bolt of lightning. A scientist requires that results be repeatable before he accepts the results.\n\nThe title text refers to the scientist's method of pulling the lever again and again, trying to understand how the machine works, as opposed to the normal person, just avoiding pain. This could be a nod towards how scientists sometimes go to extreme measures for knowledge.\n\nFor a different view on the topic of repetition in experimentation, see [[1657: Insanity]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[All the panels are circular.]\n\n:[Cueball pulls a lever.]\n:''Pull''\n\n:[Lightning hits Cueball.]\n:''ZAP''\n\n:[Cueball still stands, obviously battered.]\n\n:[An arrow labelled \"normal person\" points to a panel of Cueball thinking.]\n:Cueball (thinking): I guess I shouldn't do that.\n\n:[An arrow labelled \"scientist\" points to a panel of Cueball about to pull the level again.]\n:Cueball (thinking): I wonder if that happens every time.\n\n==Trivia==\nThis comic used to be [https://web.archive.org/web/20220125023401/https://store.xkcd.com/products/signed-prints available as a signed print] in the xkcd store before it was [[Store|shut down]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics with xkcd store products]]"
