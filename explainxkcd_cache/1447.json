[http://www.medline.com/ Medline], [http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/embase/about Embase] and [http://www.cochrane.org/ Cochrane] are medical research databases which give access to studies on drug effects or results of other medical procedures.\n\nThis comic explores the idea of iterating the process, going from meta-analyses to meta-meta-analyses (which actually exist, though not necessarily by that name, see below) and hence to a meta-meta-meta-analysis.\n\nOf course, the title text adds another level of meta-analysis, since he wants to make a meta-analysis of rejection letters which concern his meta-meta-meta analyses.\n\nAll of the cited meta-meta-analyses are real: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0895-4356(03)00110-0 M. Sampson (2003)], [http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01645.x P. L. Royle (2005)], [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.01.007 E. Lee (2011)], and [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2005.03.004 A.R. Lemeshow (2005)].\n\nThe phrase \"too meta\" can be found in the comments of videos, blog posts, and other internet content for which the commentator claims they are so abstract that they can't be easily interpreted. It refers to the thing in question being too self-referential, but could just be a cursory dismissal of the presented content.\n\nComic [[93: Jeremy Irons]] similarly states a slightly absurd \"life goal\". [[917: Hofstadter]] is \"meta\"-related.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Excerpt from a scientific paper.]\n:Many meta-analysis studies include the phrase “We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for studies…”\n:This has led to meta-meta-analyses comparing meta-analysis methods. e.g. M Sampson (2003), PL Royle (2005), E Lee (2011), AR Lemeshow (2005).\n:We performed a meta-meta-meta-analysis of these meta-meta-analyses.\n:<u>Methods:</u> We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for the phrase “We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for the phrase ‘We searched Medline, Embase, and [cut off]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Life goal #28: get a paper rejected with the comment “Too meta”\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]\n[[Category:Self-reference]]"
