I have a thesis to write!'

A thesis consists of original research and generally deals with material that is difficult for the uninitiated to understand. Cueball anticipates that it will be difficult to understand, and asks her to \"explain it like I'm five\". \"Explain it like I'm five\" is a way of asking for a simpler explanation of some difficult topic, in a way that a five-year-old child would be able to understand. Megan sarcastically (or perhaps not) treats Cueball as if he is an actual 5-year-old without his parents, expressing her concern that a 5-year-old is without any supervision. This is an example of idiomatic language being taken literally, something that [[Randall]] has explored in other comics as well, such as [[1454: Done]], [[Shake That]], and [[Reverse Euphemisms]]. The common expression \"Explain it like I'm five\" is inspired by a line by {{w|Groucho Marx}} in his movie {{w|Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup}}. \"''Why a four-year-old child could understand this report! Run out and find me a four-year-old child, I can't make head or tail of it.''\"[http://muse.tau.ac.il/maslool/boidem/54groucho.html]\n\nIn the title text, Megan feigns concern that she will have to abandon her work to take care of this supposed lost child and takes this role-playing further by refusing to respond to Cueball until he phrases his comments as a 5-year-old would.\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: What've you been up to?\n:Megan: Doing tons of math for my thesis.\n:Cueball: Can you explain it like I'm five?\n:Megan: \"Oh my god, where are your parents?\"\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/ Explain like I'm five subreddit.]\n*[http://www.freerangekids.com freerangekids.com] blog for and by parents who would rather have their kids asking math grad students questions than constantly reporting their geocoordinates.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Scientific research]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring children]]"
