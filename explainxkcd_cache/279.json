Let's fucking do it and never look back.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic adds strange twists to some classic abysmally cheesy {{w|pickup line}}s. Warning, terrible puns ahead:\n\n*\"If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.\"\n:[[Cueball]] is making a \"your sister\" joke. A different variation of this line is featured in [[1069: Alphabet]], and similar \"your sister\" jokes are made in [[49: Want]], [[273: Electromagnetic Spectrum]], [[317: That Lovin' Feelin']], and panel 20 of [[442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel]].\n*\"Is your father a thief? Because he stole all of the stars in the sky and put them in your eyes.\"([http://www.jokes4us.com/pickuplines/isyourdadpickuplines.html Is Your Dad Pick Up Lines])\n:A {{w|Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta}} is a car, and Cueball is implying that the father is an actual thief.\n*\"You must be tired, 'cause you've been running through my mind all night.\"\n:He adds the word \"Screaming,\" to make the word \"running\" be literal instead of figurative.\n\nThis is yet another example of [[Beret Guy]]'s bartender job.\n\nThe title text refers to a pickup line like this: \"That shirt looks good on you, but would look even better on my bedroom floor.\" But here the shirt is used as fuse for a {{w|Molotov cocktail}} thrown into their office.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A bar. Beret Guy is the bartender, holding a can or mug. On the counter are a bottle and two mugs. In front of the counter are four barstools. Megan is to the left of the second barstool and Cueball is to the right, talking to her.]\n:Cueball: If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put your sister and I together.\n\n:[Another bar scene, shown from a different angle, with the bartender at left of panel and two barstools to the right. Cueball, standing, is talking to a different woman seated at the bar. Cueball points toward the front window of the bar.] \n:Cueball: Is your father a thief? Because that's totally my Jetta you parked outside.\n\n:[Another bar scene. A bar with one mug on it, and one barstool, are visible. Cueball stands talking to Ponytail.]\n:Cueball: You must be tired, 'cause you've been running through my mind all night.\n:Cueball: Screaming.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Beret Guy]]\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Your sister]]"
