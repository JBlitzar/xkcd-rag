    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1565\n| date      = August 17, 2015\n| title     = Back Seat\n| image     = back_seat.png\n| titletext = Hang on, let me scare the live raccoon over to the same side as the dead one.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic makes fun of the common situation of a messy car, using a hyperbolic scenario of that car containing decaying animals, in this case a {{w|raccoon}}. The joke being that such a car is so disgusting that a dead raccoon is not the worst thing that one might encounter. The humor comes from the car owner seeming to be used to a dead raccoon and the implications of what might be worse than a dead raccoon.\n\nThis is the polar opposite of [[1267: Mess]], where the person apologizes for a nearly non-existent mess. Here, the person minimizes a completely atrocious mess into a quick fix situation. The form of the comic is that of a pro-tip, which tells the reader what the phrase \"I just have to clear a few things out of the back\" really means.\n\n'{{w|Protip}}s' are used to give snarky, obvious or inadequate advice, in order to either humor a well-learnt audience or to prank a na√Øve audience. This phenomenon originated in a gaming magazine column offering advice on ''Doom'': \"To defeat the Cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies.\", which is analogous to saying that fire is hot. [[Randall]] has given us several [[:Category:Protip|Protips]] in the past as well.\n\nThe title text further exposes the reality of the person's knowledge of how bad the situation really is when he acknowledges the existence of the dead raccoon while trying to usher the live one to the same side. Protip: Sitting next to a dead ''and'' a live raccoon is not an improved scenario, as the dead raccoon would probably be decaying, leaking bodily fluids into the back seat, staining the seat and making it wet, while the live raccoon may be aggravated, and possibly attacking the occupants of the vehicle.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Caption above the panel.]\n:Protip:\n\n:[Cueball is holding the back door of his car open. Wiggly lines emanate from the back seat area. Megan and another Cueball-like guy are stand next to the car, looking at each other.]\n:Cueball: Hang on, I just have to clear a few things out of the back.:\n\n:[Caption below the panel.]\n:When you hear \"I just have to clear a few things out of the back,\" you are about to see, at minimum, a decaying raccoon.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The title text originally contained a grammatical error, \"same side of the dead one\", which was later corrected by Randall.\n*Raccoons also feature in a disgusting situation in [[1025: Tumblr]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Protip]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
