He narrates because he is especially known for his soothing and mellow voice, which helps him amplify performances in minor parts, such as God in ''{{w|Bruce Almighty}}''. He has been a narrator of many TV programs and also narrated the major film ''{{w|War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds}}'' where he did not play any other part.\n\nThe comic is a play on the combination of the two. The idea is that while reading a text, instead of hearing your own voice in your mind's ear, you substitute it with Freeman's voice, giving a new perspective on the contents of the text. Here, the voice of Morgan Freeman converts the most annoying possible thing on the web (penis enlargement advertisements) into a soothing meditation.\n\nThe title text suggests to apply this specifically on the mostly stupid comments on YouTube, like those found in [[202: YouTube]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting behind a desk with a computer.]\n:Freemanic Paracusia: A disorder wherein you hear everything you read in the comforting voice of Morgan Freeman.\n:[There is a thought bubble of Cueball's thoughts, within it is Morgan Freeman reading text.]\n:Morgan Freeman: Why, you could enlarge your penis for cheap. My, my. Isn't that ''something.''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Penis]]\n[[Category:YouTube]]"
