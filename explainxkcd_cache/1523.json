While on one level he thinks the idea is cool, [[Cueball]] worries about living in a sci-fi dystopia, with those drones flying all around him, tracking his actions, etc. In the third panel, [[Megan]] suggests sending a message to Congress, suggesting a law for making the stealing of drones legal. This would alleviate the problem of drones flying around everywhere because if they did people would catch them to use for themselves. In the final panel Megan begins to search for {{w|butterfly nets}} so they are ready to catch the microdrones when the law to make it legal to steal the drones goes through.\n\nThis tactic may not work as well as planned; drones will likely simply fly higher or employ other security measures since there are no regulations on drone behavior.\n\nThe title text implies that Amazon has seen this idea coming; they've marked butterfly nets as \"out of stock\", to prevent prospective drone thieves from acquiring them. Alternatively, it could be taken to mean that:\n*Amazon is out of stock of butterfly nets due to everyone purchasing them to catch drones with, implying many people had the same idea as Megan.\n*Non-Amazon individuals controlling the drones have pre-emptively purchased them all.\n*Amazon has put all of its nets into a private stock, in order to steal other companies' or individuals' drones.\n*Amazon's drones have already become self-aware, and have altered the database in order to prevent their capture.\n\n\nAmazon drones is also the subject of the title text in [[1625: Substitutions 2]] and there are two {{w|quadcopters}} over the volcano lake in [[1608: Hoverboard]]. Also, Cueball is abducted by seemly sentient drones in [[1630: Quadcopter]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is standing behind Megan who sits at a desk typing on her laptop.]\n:Cueball: So how do we regulate all these micro drones?\n:Cueball: I mean, Amazon delivery bots sound cool...\n\n:[Cueball stands alone surrounded by three micro drones.]\n:Cueball: But I worry that overnight we'll realize we're surrounded by these things, no one will know who's controlling them, and then ''bam'', sci-fi dystopia.\n\n:[Megan turns in her chair towards Cueball.]\n:Megan: If you wanna slow it down, why not just remove all regulations, but then make drone theft legal?\n\n:[Cueball takes his hand to his chin and Megan turns back to type on the laptop.]\n:Cueball: ...I ''like'' that.\n:Megan: You write to congress.\n:Megan: I'll stock up on butterfly nets.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Butterfly net]]\n[[Category:Drones]]"
