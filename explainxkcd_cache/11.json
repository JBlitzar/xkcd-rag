The previous one was [[14: Copyright]], and the next one was [[15: Just Alerting You]]. It was among the [[:Category:First day on LiveJournal|first thirteen comics]] posted to LiveJournal within 12 minutes on September 30, 2005, on the first day of the xkcd LiveJournal account.\n\n==Explanation==\nAs in the previous comic in the [[:Category:The Boy and his Barrel|The Boy and his Barrel series]], the boy is floating in the ocean inside a barrel. The previous comic made a point about the uncertainty of life; here, [[Barrel Boy]]'s lament at not finding a mother is pure sentimentality, as accentuated by the title text. According to Freud, the first stage of psycho-sexual development is the Oral Stage, which relates to a baby's relationship with its mother. The realization that 'mommy' cannot be found is the first point at which a person learns to stop trusting the world and realizes that the world is not always comforting and safe.\n\nThis is the third in a six-part series of comics whose parts were randomly published during the first several dozen strips. The series features [[Barrel Boy]], a character that is different from what would quickly become the xkcd [[stick figure]] style. The full series can be found [[:Category:The Boy and his Barrel|here]]. After Randall released the full [http://liveweb.archive.org/web/20070207052159/http://www.xkcd.com/barrel.html The Boy and his Barrel] story on the site, it became clear that the original comic [[20: Ferret]] was also part of the series. The comics are listed in the order chosen by Randall:\n* [[1: Barrel - Part 1]]\n* [[20: Ferret]]\n* [[11: Barrel - Part 2]]\n* [[22: Barrel - Part 3]]\n* [[25: Barrel - Part 4]]\n* [[31: Barrel - Part 5]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Barrel Boy sits in a barrel which is floating in an ocean.]\n:Barrel Boy: none of the places i floated had mommies.\n\n==Trivia==\nAfter its release on [[LiveJournal]], the comic was edited to lighten the gridlines, as Randall explained in [[Barrel - Part 4]]'s original LiveJournal caption. He has said that he considers this cheating, but as he is \"not destroying anyone's childhood\", he doesn't feel as if he's \"pulling a George Lucas\".
