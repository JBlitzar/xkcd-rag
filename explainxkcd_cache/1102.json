It can be misleading for gauging the importance or popularity of something; If you add only 4 members to an existing group of 2, you would have achieved a growth of 200 percent.\n\nIn the case portrayed in this comic the claim appears to be that the other person's religion grew by 85%. [[Black Hat]] attempts humorously to show the flaw in using that statistic by growing his group by 100% (therefore, presumably, first place), which he simply does by adding his friend [[Rob]] to his religion, and thus increasing his membership from 1 to 2. The other person then says that his religion has a significant number of members (and not just one or two, but ended up with 38,000 this year, presumably having 'only' around 20,540 in the prior one), but Black Hat doesn't care and responds that he hopes they are all okay with being \"in second place\" since the main argument from the other guy was about being the fastest-growing.\n\nThe title text ponders the ironic idea of converting ''only'' the zealous door-to-door {{w|Proselytism|proselytizers}} to a very persuasive religion of one's own. It is also possible that after the last panel, the proselytizer would have joined Black Hat's religion to be first by this metric and Black Hat played the same trick several times to get many proselytizers join his religion.\n\nAnother interpretation is that the title text could be another way that Black Hat could take the 'fastest-growing' claim out of context to make it meaningless. By composing his religion of the unwitting proselytizers of other faiths, he can claim the highest ratio of converts to current adherents. Note that the amount of people converted is often exaggerated by groups that try to spread a faith. Although the beliefs spread by his proselytizers vary widely, Black Hat is not concerned with what his so-called followers believe. Thus, he can claim the title of fastest-growing religion without having any value to his religion.\n\nVarious religions and groups encourage their members to actively recruit new followers, such as the {{w|Mormon missionary}} (or \"Missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\", to use their own more acceptable full name).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A man with a combover, a book, and a clipboard approaches Black Hat.]\n:Combover: You should check us out. We're the fastest-growing religion in the country.\n:Black Hat: \"Fastest-growing\" is such a dubious claim.\n:Combover: It's true! We grew by 85% over the past year.\n\n:[In a frameless panel, Black Hat shouts to Rob, out of frame.]\n:Black Hat: Hey, Rob â€” wanna join my religion?\n:Rob's off-frame voice: Sure, whatever.\n\n:[Black Hat turns back to Combover and produces a notepad and pen.]\n:Black Hat: Well, looks like my religion grew by 100% this year.\n\n:[Black Hat begins to walk away.]\n:Combover: We have 38,000 members!\n:Black Hat: Hope they're all ok with second place.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Rob]]\n[[Category:Religion]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]"
