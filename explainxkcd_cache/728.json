[[Megan]] tries to bring perspective to him by telling him that there are so many more futuristic things in the (possibly) near future. Cueball still objects, because that makes him feel that he's too easily impressed by trivial things, and says that Megan is spoiling his fun by trying to make his source of entertainment seem so mundane compared to \"monkeys controlling robotic arms via neural implants\".\n\nThe title text is showing how Cueball is, instead of being horrified by all the new ways to die technology could present, like a scientist, enthralled by the many newer ways that death could occur.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is sitting in an armchair, playing with an iPad. Megan is looking over his shoulder.]\n:Cueball: Navigating Google Maps on the iPad is fun. It feels so futuristic.\n:Cueball: Swoosh! Zoom!\n\n:[Close-up on Megan.]\n:Megan: There are, right now, monkeys controlling robotic arms via neural implants.\n\n:Megan: A huge and alien future is barreling toward us. And I can't ''wait''.\n\n:[Zoom-out on both characters. Cueball is still looking down on his iPad.]\n:Megan: But no, your iPad is cool, too.\n:Cueball: Stop spoiling my future with your slightly more distant one.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Google Maps]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:iOS]]"
