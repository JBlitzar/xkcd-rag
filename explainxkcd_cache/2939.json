The average-case complexity of the algorithm is written in {{w|Big O notation}} as O(''n'' log ''n''), expressing the limiting behavior of the algorithm's runtime as its number of inputs grows larger and larger. \n\nThe comic's joke involves taking the terms \"best case\" and \"worst case\" far more broadly and literally than intended. Cueball presents not just the best/worst cases for the data input into the function, but also the global environment as a whole, taking in factors such as the United States Congress which should fall ''far'' outside the algorithm's scope.\n\nIn particular, the joke regards the analysis of a closed system, which is common in engineering. An algorithm's \"best case\" is typically its runtime when its inputs have optimal values and it runs in as little time as possible. One example would be a {{w|Sorting algorithm#Comparison of algorithms|sorting algorithm}} that is called with an already-sorted list of numbers; an algorithm ''may'' only need to check each item in the list, in one pass, to confirm this, compared with having to compare an arbitrary number of items against an arbitrary number of others across a number of cycles. The worst case would be when a list is 'unsorted' in a way that presents the maximum number of challenges and actions to the sorting algorithm (possibly, but ''not necessarily'', when presented with the initial list exactly in the wrong order/reversed). These two limits can each be given by an O-notation, but a single O-notation generally indicates the mean complexity of operation encountered for all inputs.\n\nThe joke here is that not only does this algorithm 'run' quicker than what would otherwise be considered its best case scenario, by being terminated early because it is deemed to be 'unnecessary', but its runtime appears to be an hour shorter still because of an act of Congress changing {{w|daylight saving time}}, giving it an end time (in local time) that is an hour less than it would have been under other circumstances. Potentially this would result in an end time that is recorded as earlier than its start time (depending on [[2867: DateTime|how the times are handled]]), and therefore an apparently ''negative'' 'runtime'. Daylight saving time is a [[:Category: Daylight saving time|recurrent theme]] on xkcd, and it is clear that Randall is not a fan, so Congress making surprise DST changes is another way for Randall to mock the concept.\n\nThe \"worst case\" refers to the movie {{w|Groundhog Day (movie)|Groundhog Day}}, in which the same events occur over and over in a sort of time loop. (This movie has been referenced before in [[1076|1076: Groundhog Day]].) If the hardware running the algorithm is present in this kind of loop then it may also reset to a previous time before it gets finished, meaning the algorithm would never terminate. This gives rise to a philosophical question about the movie as to whether the whole world is reset after every day, or just the town where the movie takes place. If it is just the town, and you could still connect to their hardware from outside, then from that perspective the algorithm would appear to be taking an interminably long time to run. If the whole world resets, since people (aside from the movie's main character) do not experience the reset, it would only appear to take as long as it does once the last (non-resetting cycle) leads it into the expected following day.\n\nThis may be an indirect reference to the {{w|halting problem}}, a famous problem in computer science. The halting problem is {{w|undecidable}}, meaning that no general algorithm can tell whether a given algorithm will halt, but the widely accepted traditional proof of this relies on external action on details of a system considered closed.\n\nThe title text refers to perhaps an even more famous problem in computer science: {{w|P versus NP problem|P versus NP}}. This asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (in nondeterministic polynomial time, {{w|NP_(complexity)|NP}}) can also be quickly solved (in polynomial time, {{w|polynomial time|P}}). The P-versus-NP problem is one of the seven {{w|Millennium Prize Problems}}, and as such has a $1 million prize for its solution.  Presumably, the problem discussed here is in NP, so if P=NP, its worst-case runtime would be some polynomial O(''n<sup>k</sup>)''.  However, P vs. NP is a Millennium Prize Problem for a reason; most computer scientists expect that Pâ‰ NP, so hoping for a breakthrough in proving P=NP is \"perpetually optimistic\". This may be a reference to {{w|optimism bias}} and the {{w|planning fallacy}}, whereby people tend to assume that the most favourable outcome will be the most likely.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding a presentation pointer stick, pointing to a table behind him that towers above him.
