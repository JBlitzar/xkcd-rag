Their purpose is to rehabilitate him from his anti-Christmas ways of apathy, indifference and general cruelty to the weak and poor. By their intervention they generally improve his humanity and spiritual future by showing him how he came to be this this way (Past), how he is seen right now (Present) and what his future would be if he continues down that road (Yet to Come), and thus rekindling his capability of love, humility, and kindness.\n\nIn this case, however, three {{w|Halloween}}-style ghosts arrive as a spoof of that tale. They represent similar phases of the actual festival of Halloween, but have turned up to pester Cueball in his bed all at the same time. And the 'lesson' they convey to him is far less transformative in nature. Since the ghosts say nothing more than minor variations of \"oOOOOOOOOo,\" the lesson may be that Halloween has no \"true meaning\" other than what is obvious (compare [[1108: Cautionary Ghost]]), or that the true meaning of Halloween consists merely of the kind of silly \"scariness\" represented by the sound \"oOOOOOOOOo\". Additionally, since Halloween is typically represented by ghosts, the ghosts only have to exist as themselves to spread the \"true meaning of Halloween\" (as opposed to the various Ghosts of Christmas, as Christmas is not so directly associated with ghosts).\n\nCaroling, though these days almost exclusively associated with Christmas, had long been a term for festive songs and dances. Arguably, it is largely through Dickens's use as his story title that we associate it so strongly with this particular annual festival, which might be another additional joke on [[Randall]]'s part.\n\nA similar ghost saying \"ooOOOOOOOOooo\", along with much scarier things, appears in [[1393: Timeghost]].\n\nIn the title text, it would appear that the very simple message has been received and taken to heart, but the apparitions feel the need to continue their haunting regardless. This is something that might be further associated with Halloween, because annoyingness is a staple of Halloween (as it is of life in general).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is half sitting up in bed, his lower body underneath the blankets.
