[[Megan]], presumably his first customer, has inserted her quarters into the machine for the specified price, and expresses concern that the pears aren't being dispensed; Beret Guy simply assures her that \"it takes a while to work\".\n\nBehind the front of the machine, thus hidden from Megan, we see that what the machine does is dispense a seed into the dirt via a small cannon. Above it is a robotic arm and a hopper for collecting and dispensing the ripened pears. So it seems that Megan will have to rattle the coin-slot \"a while\" before she gets her fresh pear.\n\nThe term \"a while\" is ambiguous, but in the context of waiting for a vending machine to dispense food, it's usually assumed to be a matter of seconds.{{Citation needed}} Beret Guy, in his typical surrealist [[:Category:Beret Guy's Business|approach to business]], seems to consider it reasonable to wait at the machine for years until a tree has sprouted from the dispensed seed, grown to maturity and begun bearing fruit, that could be picked by the robotic arm and dispensed to the buyer. This could easily take [https://www.starkbros.com/growing-guide/article/how-many-years/ between 5-8 years] for a pear tree, when starting only with a seed!  While such a pear would indeed be \"fresh\", it's implausible that anyone would accept that kind of lag time in buying a pear at a vending machine, even if it is cheap, particularly considering that any number of factors could interfere with the production of pears in the meantime.{{Citation needed}} Alternatively, Beret Guy may be planning on using [[1088:_Five_Years|time-altering abilities]] to rapidly grow the tree.\n\nIt appears that the coin mechanism only operates the seed-launcher; whether once the machine starts harvesting the pears it will freely dispense them or activate a barrier on the chute is unknown.\n\nThis comic strip may be based on a fable about an old man who plants trees, knowing that he will not be alive when they bear fruit, to \"pay it forward\" to his children as his ancestors planted the trees that had sprouted and fed him.  Beret Guy may be practicing good moral behavior and ecological stewardship, but as a customer-facing business model it leaves a little to be desired.\n\nIt seems Megan is one of the first to use the machine, as no pear sprouts are shown behind the machine.\n\nThe title text refers to the increased difficulty in cultivating desirable {{w|apples}}, as compared to other fruits.  Apples cannot be reliably produced from seeds, seedlings often don't survive, and even when they do, they don't generally reflect the characteristics of the parent plant. As a result, apple orchards are created by {{w|grafting}} tissue from desirable trees onto suitable rootstock.  This process is more complex and labor-intensive than simply planting seeds.  The joke, then, is that the next planned version of the machine would not only require the user to wait years, but would also involve as-yet unavailable technology to automatically perform the grafting process as to create an apple tree that produces desirable fruit.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is rattling the coin-slot of a machine while Beret Guy stands behind her arm held out towards her. The Machine has a tall wall in front of Megan, with only the coin-slot and a dispenser visible to her. Behind it is a hopper connected to the dispenser. On top of that is a two time folded arm with a gripper at the end. Below this is a box with a label. Beneath the box is a small cannon like protrusion, which shoots something into the dirt to the left of the machine. There are lines indicating both the explosion, the trajectory of the projectile and the impact with sounds noted at either end. Behind White Hat is a sign.]\n:Box Label: Seeds\n:Cannon: Ptoo\n:Impact: Thwup\n:Coin-slot: ''Rattle rattle''\n:Megan: I put in my quarters.
