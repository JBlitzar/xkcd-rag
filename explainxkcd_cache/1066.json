However, due to increasing laziness/workload, by the second week they have abandoned folding their clothes, and by the third week no longer bother hanging them in the closet. By the second month dirty clothes are no longer stored in a laundry hamper and are just dumped on the floor, and by the end of the semester clothes are not washed at all instead rotating between the floor and the students body.\n\nThe title text seems to indicate that the student has a brainwave, some time later, to wash their clothes in the dishwasher along with the dishes. Presumably as a timesaver. The experiment was brief because dishwashers aren't actually any good at washing clothes<sup>&#x5B;<em>[[2420:_Appliances|1]]</em>&#x5D;</sup> as they wouldn't move the clothes about.\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''College Laundry Habits'''\n\n:[Panel labeled \"First Week\". 5 ovals arranged in a rough circle, with a clockwise path connecting them: \"Dresser & Closet\", \"On Body\", \"Hamper\", \"Washer & Dryer\", \"Folding Area\" (and back to the first). The area outside the ovals is labeled \"Floor.\"]\n\n:[Panel labeled \"Second Week\". The path has been modified so that it does not go through \"Folding Area\" - only through the other 4 ovals.]\n\n:[Panel labeled \"Third Week\". The path has been modified so that it does not go through \"Dresser & Closet\". Only \"On Body\", \"Hamper\", and \"Washer & Dryer\" remain.]\n\n:[Panel labeled \"Second Month\". The path no longer passes through \"Hamper\" - only \"On Body\" and \"Washer & Dryer\".]\n\n:[Panel labeled \"End of Semester\". The path no longer goes to \"Washer & Dryer\", instead just looping back around from \"On Body\" to \"On Body\" again after passing through the \"Floor.\"]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Flowcharts]]"
