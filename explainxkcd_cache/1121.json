Just remember to constantly bring up how cool it is that birds are dinosaurs and you'll be set.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Cueball]] lost the server password and is asking [[Megan]] what it is. Megan correctly comments that she can't be sure through text-based messages that it's really Cueball asking for the password; it could be someone impersonating him attempting to {{w|Social engineering (security)|socially engineer}} access to the server. Cueball answers by starting to develop a cryptographic protocol they can use for proof of identity, probably something like {{w|Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR Messaging}} as implemented in many {{w|XMPP}} chat clients or {{w|Fiat-shamir protocol|Feige–Fiat–Shamir identification scheme}}. In reality, it would already be too late for that — they should have prepared something beforehand. Before he even finishes, Megan answers \"It's you\", meaning that no one else is so geeky that they would answer like that. Cueball, dismayed at the fact that his geekery has become a defining characteristic of his and also at a lost opportunity to devise his protocol, shouts [texts?] \"NO!\".\n\nIn the title text, [[Randall]] suggests that this is, in fact, his own personality, and that anyone reading the comic can now impersonate him. For a bonus, he notes his own fascination with the fact that [[1211: Birds and Dinosaurs|birds are just modern dinosaurs]], which one could use to impersonate him as well.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Cueball: Hey, I lost the server password. What is it, again?\n\n:Megan: It's— ...Wait. How do I know it's really you?\n\n:Cueball: Ooh, good question! I bet we can construct a cool proof-of-identity protocol. I'll start by picking two random—\n:Megan: Oh good; it's you. Here's the password...\n:Cueball: ''NO!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"
