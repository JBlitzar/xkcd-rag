The ship is equipped with {{w|Replicator (Star Trek)|replicators}}, which can create virtually any object or material requested, including food and drink, and which respond to verbal commands. \n\nIn the show, Picard's beverage of choice is {{w|Earl Grey tea}}.  His habitual method for ordering is to first specify what he wants (tea, in this case), then specify a particular type (Earl Grey), and then give specific instructions for how it is to be served (hot, as opposed to {{w|iced tea}}).  Because this is his favored drink, he repeatedly places the exact order \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaAT6-dY1QI Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.]\" The first picture in the strip implies that the display shows each part of the order, and provides a list of options for the next step.\n\n[[Randall]] parodies this repeated order by suggesting [[#Other Words|other words]] that could follow \"Tea. Earl Grey.\", starting from ones he considers more \"normal\" moving to those he presumes increasingly \"less normal\" down a long and winding arrow.\n\nThe results of two examples from the normal/less-normal scale are also illustrated: Sticky tea and loud tea. Sticky is kind of obvious, though perhaps not immediately understandable, the loud version is a tea that screams \"Teeee...\"  The vibrating and screeching teacup may be a reference to the various ''Star Trek'' episodes about {{w|tribble}}s, which behave in a similar way in the presence of Klingons.\n\nThe very last qualifying addition, the least normal is not a single word but \"Tea for him, too.\" This reinterprets the meaning of the standard introductory words, suggesting that \"tea\", and \"Earl Grey\" are separate orders, which implies that he wants the replicator to produce tea, then replicate a human being named Earl Grey (either one of the {{w|Earl Grey|Earls Grey}} or a person surnamed Grey with the given name of Earl), then a second tea to serve to this newly created person. {{w|Earl Grey tea}} is named after the {{w|Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey}}, a 19th century British Prime Minister, and Captain Picard possibly wishes to have said Earl be generated to provide him with company.\n\nIn contrast to the often trivial use of a replicator as merely a potentially infinitely versatile vending machine, the comic sets up a number of quite esoteric options, culminating in Earl Grey himself potentially drinking (generic) tea, after both the tea and he have been replicated into existence by Picard.\n\nIn the title text, someone tells Picard that they should wait until the Earl has been fully extruded from the dispenser, and ''then'' ascertain what he would actually wish to drink. The presumption is that it could take some time to get a full living person out of the replicator.  This sort of operation would be better suited for the holodeck, which has been used to create simulacra of other historical figures, including Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, and Sir Isaac Newton, with the limitations that they are mere simulations without their own autonomy and cannot exist beyond the limits of the fixed holotransmitters; though at least two others seem to have gained full sentience, and granted (or be convinced they were granted) physical freedom.\n\nIn the various versions of ''{{w|Star Trek}}'', it's established that {{w|Replicator_(Star_Trek)#Origins_and_limitations|replicators aren't capable of producing living things}}, so canonically this version of the order could not be filled.\n\n===Other Words===\n{| border =1 width=100% cellpadding=1 class=\"wikitable\"\n! Word !! Explanation\n|-\n| Hot\n| A fairly normal word to be used when ordering tea. Although that it even needs specifying is itself a clue that other variations (such as \"Iced\", below) are available. This is the chosen word of the five visible words Picard is potentially presented with in the first drawing. The act of requesting this is thus illustrated, though not of the appearance of the tea itself.\n|-\n| Iced\n| {{w|Iced tea}} is a typical variation of tea. In the United States, iced tea is a popular alternative to soft drinks and makes up about 85% of all tea consumed, although (perhaps owing to being from Boston, whose climate is not too sweltering to motivate cold drinks) Randall classifies it as less normal than hot Earl Grey.\n|-\n| Decaf\n| Traditional teas (from {{w|Camellia sinensis}}) tend to have caffeine in them. Asking for {{w|Decaffeination|decaffeinated}} tea is not particularly uncommon if the drinker requires it. In the series ''Picard'', set several decades after ''The Next Generation'', Picard does actually order \"Tea, Earl Grey, decaf\" in [https://tvline.com/2020/01/26/star-trek-picard-premiere-easter-eggs-earl-grey-decaf/ one scene]. Earl Grey tea typically has [https://simplelooseleaf.com/blog/black-tea/earl-grey-tea-caffeine/ about 30 milligrams of caffeine,] depending on how long it is {{w|Steeping|steeped}}.\n|-\n| Good\n| A normal, subjective term. Most people drinking tea would want it to be good, but to specify it like this would perhaps be strange. This is one of the words in the first drawing, as a listed alternative to Hot. It is possible that he is saying it after the machine has dispensed its tea.\n|-\n| Lukewarm\n| While this is a temperature that tea can be at, most people (including Jean-Luc) do not want their teas to be lukewarm. \n|-\n| Tasty\n| Similar to good, most people would want their tea to be tasty, or at least flavorsome. This word being below 'lukewarm' may imply that Randall dislikes Earl Grey. Or perhaps he actually considers it implicit, and thus is fairly redundant to specify - unlike even 'hot'.\n|-\n| Boiled\n| Boiling the water used to make the tea is a common way to increase the flavor and nutrients extracted from the tea leaves. It is suggested that the ideal temperature for hot water is 75-98째C (167-210째F), according to whether it is a light tea or a dark one, and that it should be sipped at around 65째C/150째F-ish if desired 'hot' to prevent scalding.\nThis command/specification may be meant as a contrast to a cold brew and using 'boiled' rather than 'hot' clarifying the intention for a tea brewed in hot water rather than a tea brewed in cold water and then heated up, which some detractors claim negatively affects the taste, although if that is the case then that implies Picard has been drinking heated up cold tea for most of the series.\n|-\n| Watery\n| Tea is a drink that often involves water, but this perhaps suggests over dilution or under infusion in some way.\n|-\n| Sour\n| Many people do not enjoy sour tea or coffee, which is usually a sign of overextraction and thus a strange thing to specify when ordering Earl Grey tea. Lemon tea can perhaps be considered a sour tea, although most, if not all, people would say 'lemon' rather than 'sour'.\n|-\n| Meaty\n| Most teas are plant-based. While meat-based teas such as {{w|beef tea}} do exist they are more generally regarded as either a soup or a medicine, and unlikely to be combined with actual tea. Meaty is also a descriptive term that could be used for robustly flavoured teas, such as an Assam. However, Earl Grey is a light, floral tea, for which this descriptor is unlikely to be appropriate.\n|-\n| Solid\n| Tea is usually drunk as a liquid. It would be strange to ask for solid tea, although given the setting of the series perhaps Picard wishes to bring along the solid tea so he can make a cup while off the ''Enterprise''. Alternatively, Picard could be asking for frozen tea, or ice, which would begin solid but melt in his mouth.   \n|-\n| Dry\n| {{w|Dryness (taste)|\"Dry\"}} most often describes alcoholic beverages with no sweetening ingredients, and all the sugar has been consumed by the fermentation. It can refer to a particular \"mouth feel,\" also caused by lack of sweetness. While unsweetened tea is nothing unusual, describing it as \"dry tea\" is. Alternatively Picard might be asking for literal dry tea, either unmade (e.g. tea leaves in their un-infused form) or freeze-dried back into a dehydrated form. \n\nThis is one of the five words Picard was seen presented with in the first drawing.\n|-\n| Raw\n| This describes tea that has not been \"cooked\", so it would just be tea made with room-temperature water. {{w|Iced_tea#Sun_tea|Sun tea}} is a form of iced tea that can be brewed by placing tea in a large glass container with water and leaving the container in the sun for hours, resulting in a smoother flavor. A replicator could likely produce sun tea at the same speed as hot tea, making it a viable (if somewhat exotic) choice of preparation.\n|-\n| Deep-fried\n| Tea is not usually deep-fried. But you'll probably {{w|Deep-fried Mars bar|find someone}} who has tried it, [https://www.pitco.com/blog/deep-fried-liquids-trend one way or another].\n|-\n| Sticky\n| Perhaps significantly dehydrated, or thickened with enough of a hydrophilic substance, this would produce something very unlike most teas that would usually be requested.  For example, the addition of significant amounts of sugar may lead to a more viscous brew.\nThis scenario is illustrated to show a clearly messy product that awkwardly sticks to and drips from the replicator as well as Picard.\n|-\n| Grilled\n| Meats and vegetables can be prepared via grilling, as can sandwiches and other foods. However, the grilling process requires that the comestible in question be solid so as not to fall through the grill; beverages are notorious for lacking solidity, and thus are not typically grilled.\n|-\n| Fossilized\n| Fossilizing leaves replaces their biological molecules with minerals. Brewing fossilized tea leaves would dissolve some of those and produce a beverage that resembles mineral water more than tea.\n|-\n| Magnetic\n| Tea is not magnetic. Some teas contain metals that ''can'' be magnetic, such as {{w|Irn-Bru}} (which has iron), although ''non''-magnetic iron is usually used. Magnetic metals in tea may have adverse consequences. In addition, consuming more than one magnetic source may end up squeezing tissues in the intestines or bowels, with potentially lethal consequences.\n|-\n| Ballistic\n| Usually the replicated beverage is deposited within a stationary cup, but Picard could ask for it to be dropped or thrown out instead. Unless the good captain has a sufficiently quick reaction time and the dexterity to catch the projectile cup, the tea will likely end up spilled onto the floor or splattered against a wall. It could, however, be a novel method to counter intruders.\n|-\n| Unstable\n| This word is often used to refer to radioactive or explosive materials, which hopefully is not a property of something meant to be ingested. Particularly concerning given that the world of ''Star Trek'' features a plethora of such substances, many of which are incredibly potent - for example, the tea could be made from antimatter, which would cause an explosion that could destroy the entire ship. Alternatively, this could imply that the receptacle into which the tea is delivered should be unstable - being unbalanced, or lacking a flat bottom. This is likely to lead to the tea being spilled.\n|-\n| Blessed\n| Tea is a beverage, and it may be strange to ask a machine to create 'blessed' tea. However, if the machine were to use holy water, already blessed by a human, it is [https://www.quora.com/When-does-Holy-water-lose-its-Holiness-If-its-boiled-is-the-resulting-water-vapor-still-considered-Holy-Does-it-lose-its-Holy-property-when-it-transfers-into-a-gas-Is-it-still-Holy-when-it%E2%80%99s-frozen#:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20as%20long,else%2C%20it%20remains%20holy%20water.&text=a%20simple%20change-,Never.,He%20is%20faithful possible] for it to remain \"blessed\" after the water is used to make tea. It is also possible that this is a reference to tea which could be used in [http://www.archbishoplefebvre.com/blog/baptism-can-i-use-any-liquid baptism].\nIn role-playing games, items can be Blessed, i.e. having greater positive or lesser negative effects. This includes potions, a class of drinks that do not usually include any teas but could contain the \"potion of water\", which may also, therefore, be the basis of this blessed brew.\n|-\n| Blurry\n| Being blurry is not a normal state for tea to have. Cloudy, on the other hand, is quite normal for certain brews.\n|-\n| Loud\n| While molecules in tea (especially hot tea, and vitally so in an {{w|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|Infinite Improbability Drive}}) do move vigorously, this does not usually result in distinct audible effects.\nHowever, as illustrated, it seems the requested cup of tea is produced capable of emitting a high-pitched, high-volume whining sound that entirely dominates the vicinity. It actually appears to somewhat vocalize what it is, Teeeee...\n|-\n| Virtual\n| In our (physical) world virtual tea cannot be exist, so asking a physical tea machine for it would be very strange (and paradoxical). However, ''Star Trek'' features the Holodeck, which creates a virtual physically interactive environment made from \"holo-matter\", which is stated to be not the same as real matter (though not how).\n|-\n| Intravenous\n| This means the tea would be injected directly into the customer's veins, likely a very painful experience if the tea comes out boiling. Instrument of choice would probably be a {{w|Infuser|''tea infuser''}}. \n|-\n| Expanding\n| In a sense, most hot tea is expanding: water (and thus tea), like most materials, expands as it increases in temperature. Water has the unusual property of {{w|Water_%28molecule%29#Density_of_water_and_ice|''contracting slightly''}} from 0째 C to 4째 C, but provided the tea is above that it would classify. Possibly beyond, and explosively so, if {{w|Superheating|superheated}} and then nucleating points are introduced.\nOn the other hand, this tea may simply be tea spilled on the floor, which could then spread out as it evaporated.\n|-\n| Ironic\n| How tea could be ironic will be a mystery if your culture has no understanding of irony.  The irony of the most celebrated Frenchman in science fiction history delighting in a very British beverage is a nice touch of cosmopolitanism. There is also a possibility that the tea will speak or otherwise communicate in ironic terms. While this is very strange and unlikely, it can be considered, given the other scenarios on this list.\n|-\n| Segmented\n| Tea is usually served in a cup. There is the simple explanation that the cup is divided into segments, though this is the cup, and not technically the tea itself. Tea tends to stick together and form one liquid making it hard to segment. Separating the tea into segments would not be possible without some form of an emulsifying gel.\n|-\n| Verbose\n| This describes using lots of words and language, and would not likely be used for tea, because it cannot speak. Command-line computer programs often run in a 'silent' mode without displaying every step of what happens on the screen. Such programs may have a {{w|Verbose mode|''-verbose'' parameter}} that disables the silent mode. As the replicator is run by a computer, the verbose parameter could be applied to the process of tea-making, with the replicator providing an info-dump on the molecular arrangement of the tea, together with the cup of liquid.\n|-\n| Cursed\n| As with \"Blessed\", above, items can be Cursed in role-playing games, i.e. having greater negative or lesser positive effects; while there are strategic uses for Cursed items, generally the player would prefer uncursed ones (neutral or blessed). Amongst curseable items are potions, a class of consumables that do not usually include any teas but does contain the \"potion of water\", which may therefore be the cause of this cursed cuppa.\n\n\"Cursed items\" are more vaguely defined in real life, with various sources claiming that it applies to objects that cause people \"irritation\" or \"confusion\".\n\nCursed items have featured in xkcd previously: [[2332: Cursed Chair]], [[2376: Curbside]], and [[:Category:Cursed Connectors]].\n|-\n| Unexpected\n| By definition, Picard is asking for tea, expecting it promptly.  Perhaps the request for it to be \"unexpected\" would cause it to be delivered at an unknown time in the future, or to have some alteration.\n|-\n| Bipedal\n| Bipedal organisms have two feet.  As tea does not walk, this would be a very strange term to use when describing tea.  \n|-\n| Afraid\n| Tea does not have feelings.  Although water {{w|Water memory|may remember things}} (at least pseudo-scientifically) or [https://www.quotes.net/mquote/901305 consider some things to be unpleasant].\n|-\n| Infinite\n| The scope of this request is unclear. It could mean endless production (a steady stream of tea, without obvious limits so long as servicing the request remains practical), an instantaneous production of an infinite volume of tea (possibly more immediately shown to be flawed in its method of execution), or tea which will exceed the heat death of the universe. All could result in an infinitely ''dense'' tea (eventually?), but this may no longer be {{w|No-hair theorem|identifiable as tea}} so might be one of the less practical options, even amongst those on this list. Indeed, Randall ranks it as the least 'normal', except for just ''one'' further named order.\n|-\n| Tea for him, too\n| The comic ends its punchline by reinterpreting the syntax. Instead of adding a second adjective, Picard adds a second order of tea for an unseen guest. In ''Star Trek'', Jean-Luc Picard often offers tea to other people, so it is unclear why this would be the least normal, other than to place it at the bottom of the chart.\nThe change in syntax can be further combined with the title text: now this Replicator order is for \"Tea\" (with no specifics as to kind, temperature, state or quality), plus a replicated version ''of'' the Earl Grey (one or other of those {{w|Earl Grey|of that name}}, possibly the {{w|Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|2<sup>nd</sup> Earl}} for whom the tea blend was supposedly named), and a second such beverage for him to later drink.
