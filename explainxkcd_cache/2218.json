Lewis}} (some of which were later {{w|The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|made into movies}}, plays, and TV and radio shows) about a group of children from England who travel to a magical land called Narnia. In the first book of the series (by publication date), ''{{w|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe}}'', Narnia is accessible through a wardrobe in a residence in the English countryside. {{w|Mr. Tumnus}} is a {{w|faun}} in Narnia and the first character that the first human visitor, {{w|Lucy Pevensie}}, meets on her first trip through the wardrobe portal. Referencing Narnia is a [[:Category:Chronicles of Narnia|recurring theme]] in xkcd. Tumnus was depicted in the first comic to reference Narnia: [[665: Prudence]].\n\nThe comic also makes reference to membership in the {{w|European Union}}. The {{w|United Kingdom}} (UK) is a member of the EU at the time of this comic, but narrowly voted via {{w|2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|public referendum in 2016 to exit the EU}} (a process commonly referred to as {{w|Brexit}}, portamanteau for Britain/British and exit), but working out the details of this separation has proven more complicated than the simple in/out vote implied.\n\nNarnia applying to join the EU shortly after the UK, as referred to in the title text, would theoretically be possible, even if only ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was considered, since the UK joined the EU in 1973, whereas the wardrobe entrance to Narnia was discovered during World War 2, therefore in the period between 1939 and 1945. However, they would most likely be rejected due to not technically existing in Europe and having a monarchy government (EU membership requires a stable democracy).\n\nOne of the major issues with Brexit remains the border between {{w|Northern Ireland}} and the {{w|Republic of Ireland}}. The two countries share the island of {{w|Ireland}}, but Northern Ireland is part of the UK while the Republic is an independent country which remains part of the EU. With the UK exited from the EU, it would have different customs regulations than the Republic of Ireland, and there would need to be some kind of customs border. The most obvious solution would be to establish a controlled land border between the two countries, but this would raise some serious difficulties and dangers.\n\nNorthern Ireland has had a long history of civil unrest and ethno-nationalist conflict. The most recent period of conflict, commonly referred to as {{w|The Troubles}}, resulted in over 3000 deaths between 1969 and 1998. In 1998, the UK and Ireland entered into a treaty, known as the {{w|Good Friday Agreement}} (overwhelmingly approved by referendums in both parts of Ireland). This treaty was intended to resolve many of the issues that drove the conflict, and has largely been successful in putting a stop to the violence. One of the agreements in the treaty was a totally open border between the two parts of Ireland. As both were in the EU, this was easily done, because they already shared a customs union. Over the following two decades, the ease of transit created major trade links between the two areas, and many people lived in one country and worked in the other. In the UK Brexit referendum, a majority of Northern Ireland voters voted to remain in the EU. Placing a hard border between the two countries would create major economic disruptions, and serious hardships for people living near the border. It would also undermine the intent of the Good Friday Agreement, which could lead to the rekindling of hostilities and the return of terrorist attacks, instead of all sides pursuing purely political means to uphold their aims of finally joining with the rest of Ireland or continuing to stay British. The Irish government raised this issue from the time Brexit was first proposed, but their warnings were not fully heeded.\n\nThe alternative to this border would be to maintain open borders between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but institute customs checks between the island of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  In October 2019, Boris Johnson, British Prime Minister, negotiated a Brexit deal with the EU that included this arrangement, but from {{w|United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020|late 2020 onwards}} instituted seemingly contrary rules that have not yet (as of the end of his premiership, in 2022) been resolved.\n\nWhile the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border issue has received the most attention, the UK has land borders with two other EU countries. The UK territory of Gibraltar shares a border with Spain. There are also two Sovereign Bases Areas that share a border with the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nThe portal in the wardrobe represents ''another'' border of the UK, namely the border between England and Narnia. This 'border', of course, exists only in fiction, but the joke here is that it must be dealt with in the Brexit negotiations, further complicating an already messy situation.{{Citation needed}} A further source of implicit humor is the juxtaposition of a fantasy children's tale about the magical land of Narnia with the highly contentious, political, adult world of Brexit. \n\nCueball suggests solving the situation by simply locking the wardrobe (which was never very accessible, even in ''The Chronicles of Narnia''), effectively isolating the UK from Narnia and making the border problem moot. This wouldn't work even in the fictional world of the books, as new ways to enter Narnia pop up in every book, although most of them are accessible only to the kids from the first book and their friends.\n\nThe title text references the amount of time it has taken to complete the Brexit negotiations, that was three-plus years and counting at the time of the comic, and 'completed' during Johnson's term but leaving important issues (such as the above) not fully resolved. The negotiators had set a series of deadlines to complete the negotiations, but had repeatedly had to extend those deadlines because they hadn't reached any agreement. The comic was posted roughly one week before the then-current Brexit deadline of Oct. 31, 2019. However [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/eu-says-britain-has-requested-an-extension-of-brexit-deadline-after-uk-lawmakers-delay-vote.html it was already expected that that deadline too would probably be extended] and while the core element of Brexit eventually 'got done', there remain a number of unresolved issues. In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', time moves inconsistently in Narnia compared to Earth, usually passing more rapidly in Narnia than on Earth. Lucy Pevensie and her siblings enter the wardrobe as children, have extensive adventures in Narnia lasting many years, and then return to Earth to find that they are children again and that only a few minutes have passed. The suggestion here is that holding the slow, complex Brexit (and 'post-Brexit') negotiations in Narnia would take relatively little time on Earth, and the whole affair could be completed in time for any deadline.\n\nA punchline similar to the title text, where the slower passing of time was used to take on time-intensive real world problems, was also used for one of the comics in [[821: Five-Minute Comics: Part 3]]. The time difference was also mentioned in the title text of [[1786: Trash]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan is entering into an open wardrobe, while Cueball stands outside.]\n:Megan: I'll go ask. \n:Megan: You wait here.\n\n:[Cueball stands outside the now-closed wardrobe.]\n\n:[In a frame-less panel Cueball keeps standing outside the closed wardrobe with voices heard from inside the wardrobe.
