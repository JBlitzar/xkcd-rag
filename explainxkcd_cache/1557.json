The poem is based on nested quotations: the poet, speaking to the reader, quotes a \"traveler\", who ultimately quotes words carved in the pedestal of a crumbling statue. When people recite the poem, they add yet another level of nesting, as the reader is quoting the poet, who's quoting the traveler, who's quoting the pedestal. \n\nWhen Ponytail recites this poem, rather than reciting it normally, she adds more layers of recursive nesting, suggesting that she heard the story from a traveler, who heard it from another traveler, who heard it from another traveler. It's not clear how many layers of nesting this goes through before the rest of the text is cited (or whether the recursion is infinite). \n\nThe title similarly plays with recursion, quoting a pedestal which quotes a string of other pedestals.\n\nThe quotes are not nested properly, as they never end. So there is only the starting quotation mark (\") for each quote. If she ever finishes there would be one closing quotation mark for each quote in the recursion at the end of her sentence. See [[859: (]].\n\nA similar joke was used in [[785: Open Mic Night]]\n\n===Ozymandias text===\n:I met a traveller from an antique land<br />\n:Who said: \"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />\n:Stand in the desert.
