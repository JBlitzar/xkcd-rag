The previous one was [[29: Hitler]], and the next one was [[31: Barrel - Part 5]].\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic presents a common joke or riddle in the format of \"What do you get when you cross ''x'' with ''y''?\", giving three answers. The first answer is in the title of the comic, \"Elefino\". \"Elephino\" is a {{w|portmanteau}} of the words \"'''eleph'''ant\" and \"rh'''ino'''\". The second answer is in the title text, \"Hell if I know\". As with many of the earlier comics, the title text explains the joke rather than adding to it. While it may seem like a normal phrase, reading it aloud at a fast pace makes a sound similar to \"Elephino\". The third answer in in the comic itself, \"I haven't a goddamn clue\". This still conveys the same meaning as the title text, but it ruins the joke instead of giving the punchline, because saying it aloud doesn't reveal the answer. \n\nThis word play is reminiscent of the final scene in {{w|Buster Keaton}}'s 1921 short film ''{{w|The Boat (1921 film)|The Boat}}'' in which the titular boat is named the ''Damfino'', a word play on \"Damn if I know\".  Keaton answers his wife's question \"Where are we?\" by mouthing the name of the boat in the final scene. The filmmakers relied on audiences to read Keaton's lips, as his answer was not intertitled.\n\n==Transcript==\n:Q: What do you get when you cross an Elephant with a Rhino?\n:[Picture of elephant, mathematical addition symbol, picture of rhino, equals sign, large question mark.]\n:A: I haven't a goddamn clue.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 32]]\n[[Category:First day on xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Checkered paper]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Portmanteau‏‎]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
