Some are missing an explanation.}}\nIn this comic, each state of the United States of America has been filled-in with an object of similar shape. Several years later Randall made a new map of the US mainland [[1653: United States Map]], where he shuffled the positions of the states but filled out the outline. Also in this map Michigan has been split into two separate parts. (Here it is the mitten and the eagle). This comic could also be a reference to {{w|Giuseppe Arcimboldo}}'s portraits, which were composed of objects such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, books, and fish. \n\nVery few, if any, of the shapes used are stereotypes of the state; they are merely objects that look like the state. Some of the objects are those which the states are widely known to resemble. For example, Michigan is represented by a mitten and an eagle, and a pot with handle takes the place of Oklahoma (with the panhandle region of the state filled with a literal handle). Others, however, are more creative. Few would have likely pictured Texas as a dog or Alaska as a bear with a jet pack and laser gun. There are several incredibly simple objects filling some states. Kentucky is filled by a cloud, which conceivably could have been used for any state, and Wyoming, one of the nearly rectangular states, is simply an envelope. There are three pairs of states that are related. Georgia and Missouri each contain an image of the other, drawing attention to their similar shapes, North and South Dakota are the top and bottom halves of a {{w|guitar amplifier}} {{w|speaker cabinet}}, and Alabama and Mississippi are {{w|moai}} facing in opposite directions.\n\nColorado contains what looks like a Wikipedia article. [http://xkcd.com/1079/colorado/ A close-up of the fake article is provided.] The following references are made in the Colorado article:\n\n*The pronunciation is not that for Colorado, but for {{w|Eyjafjallajökull}}, a volcano in Iceland that erupted in April 2010. There is a missing [[859#Trivia|close parenthesis]].\n*The way it has a demilitarized zone towards Wyoming resembles {{W|North Korea}} and {{W|South Korea}}.\n*Eleven dimensions refers to {{w|string theory}}.\n*A {{w|wormhole}} is a theoretical relative of the {{w|black hole}}. This is a reference to the television series {{w|Stargate SG-1}} where a device capable of creating wormholes is located in the {{w|Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker}} in Colorado.\n*A {{w|Horcrux}} is a type of magical object in the world of {{W|Harry Potter}} that prevents the creator of it from passing on. They may die, but their soul remains to be resurrected by another wizard\n*The radiation zones around Longmont are caused by {{w|Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant}}.\n*The fake motto ''Si parare possis, vivere septem'' can be roughly translated as \"With preparation, survival is possible for over a week.\"\n\nNew Mexico, according to [https://xkcd.com/1079/info.0.json official transcript], is \"A liquid container labeled for something of unusual and silly danger\". The labeling is upside down and it refers to the nuclear testing facility White Sands Missile Range located in New Mexico for the nuclear bomb.  The joke is that it presents the white sand itself as extremely hazardous.  The phrase \"contains chemicals known only to the state of Nevada\" may be a reference to the nuclear weapons testing that occurred in Nevada (although in that case, it is not really the ''state'' of Nevada that knows those chemicals, but rather the {{w|Nevada Test Site}}, home of Area 51 ''et al''), and is also a reference to California's {{w|1986 California Proposition 65|Proposition 65}} warning label, \"WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\"\n\nThe title text makes fun of Florida which is sometimes called \"The penis of America\". Obviously, this penis is somewhat flaccid (not erect). The use of the word \"state\" is a pun, as it means some particular condition (flaccid state) as well as a political entity (The State of Florida).\n\n===Objects===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!State!!Image!!Description!!Explanation\n|-\n! {{w|Alabama}}\n|[[File:Alabama.png|200x200px]]\n|A moai head facing east.\n|{{w|Moai}} are Easter Island stone statues.\n|-\n! {{w|Alaska}}\n|[[File:Alaska1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A bear with a jet pack and a ray gun.\n|The ray gun and {{w|jet pack}} are fixtures of science fiction during the Cold War era, and the Russian Bear is an often-used personification of the country Russia in political cartoonage; the \"teddy bear\" image may be related to Alaska's former Russian heritage. The USA acquired Alaska from Russia in the Alaska Purchase of 1867 and it became a state in 1959, during the Cold War. The Cold War often featured baseless worries of a potential Russian invasion of Alaska due to their geographical proximity across the Bering Sea and Bering Strait, which persisted through the 1980s; Alaska was the location of a large number of interceptor missiles as part of Ronald Reagan's \"Star Wars Defense Initiative\" intended to shoot down missiles that might be launched from the USSR. The ray gun is pointed across the Bering Strait at Russia, consistent with Alaska's often being described as the \"first line of defense\" against Russian aggression. The teddy bear is similar in appearance to {{w|Winnie the Pooh}}.\n|-\n! {{w|Arizona}}\n|[[File:Arizona.png|200x200px]]\n|A refrigerated shelf containing milk, bread, and pastries.\n| There is likely no relation, although it is possible that it is a reference to Arizona's [https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2025-01-01/2024-will-likely-be-confirmed-as-phoenixs-hottest-year-ever extreme heat waves], of which it is well-known for.\n|-\n! {{w|Arkansas}}\n|[[File:Arkansas1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A measuring cup.\n|As the text is illegible, it is unclear if the cup is graduated for imperial units (fractions of a cup) and metric units (milliliters) or both.\n|-\n! {{w|California}}\n|[[File:California1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A vacuum.\n|An old-fashioned upright vacuum cleaner (lying down on its right side), green with a yellow bag.\n|-\n! {{w|Colorado}}\n|[[File:Colorado1079.png|200x200px]]\n|The Wikipedia article on Colorado.\n|See the [[#Transcript|Transcript section]] to read the text in the fake article. The pronunciation of \"Colorado\" given by Randall [ˈeːijaˌfjatlaˌjœːkʏtl̥] is the phonetic writing of {{w|Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull|Eyjafjallajökull}}, and Icelandic volcano that {{w|Air_travel_disruption_after_the_2010_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull_eruption|caused disruptions to air travel in Western Europe}} between March and June of 2010. An analogy pronunciation guide, it would be something as \"a [as in the letter]-ya-fiat-la-JOE-cutl. The Demilitarized Zone is the official name of the border between North Korea and South Korea. It is impossible for the state to have always existed, as that would require the existence of the United States, which was only founded in 1776. The Motto may be a reference to the very harsh conditions located on especially tall mountains, as the Rocky Mountains run directly through the state. Alternatively, danger may have been introduced via the 'erratic' wildlife and the presence of a wormhole within the state, which would make Colorado nearly uninhabitable.\n|-\n! {{w|Connecticut}}\n|[[File:Connecticut1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A train conductor's hat.\n| Connecticut is known for its [https://portal.ct.gov/dot/travel-gateway/public-transportation/ctrail?language=en_US extensive rail system] and its many residents who build {{w|Rail transport modelling|Model train systems}}.\n|-\n! {{w|Delaware}}\n|[[File:Delaware1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A meerkat.\n|There is no obvious relationship between Delaware and meerkats. Meerkats have appeared in xkcd before, notably in [[115: Meerkat]].\n|-\n! {{w|Florida}}\n|[[File:Florida1079.png|200x200px]]\n|An eggplant.\n|The title text mentions the eggplant being in a flaccid state, which might be a reference to the sexual use of the eggplant emoji. The eggplant may reference the {{w|Florida Man}} meme, which commonly involves undressed males doing unusual things.\n|-\n! {{w|Georgia}}\n|[[File:Georgia1079.png|200x200px]]\n|Missouri.\n|The outline of the state of Missouri, with the {{w|Gateway Arch}} in St. Louis. This is paired with Missouri, which contains an outline of the state of Georgia.\n|-\n! {{w|Hawaii}}\n|[[File:Hawaii1079.png|200x200px]]\n|The island of Hawaii is a snowball. The smaller islands are small bits of snow.\n| This may be an ironic reference to the fact that Hawaii is located near the equator and generally receives temperatures far too high to create snow.\n|-\n! {{w|Idaho}}\n|[[File:Idaho1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A garden gnome, sitting down.\n|While there is no obvious relation between Idaho and garden gnomes, it is possible that the gnome is a reference to the Gnome Mine, a mine in Idaho that produced a lot of gold in the 1900s.\n|-\n! {{w|Illinois}}\n|[[File:Illinois1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A gangster with a guitar case, upside down.\n|In fiction it is common to depict Prohibition-era gangsters and mobsters smuggling a Thompson submachine gun (also called a \"Tommy gun\" or \"Chicago typewriter\") in musical instrument cases.\n|-\n! {{w|Indiana}}\n|[[File:Indiana1079.png|200x200px]]\n|The brush of a paintbrush.\n|While there is no obvious relation between Indiana and paintbrushes, it may be referring to Indian Paintbrushes.\n|-\n! {{w|Iowa}}\n|[[File:Iowa1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A tomato, lettuce, cold cut and cheese sandwich.\n|This may be a reference to their famous Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, which is the official state sandwich.\n|-\n! {{w|Kansas}}\n|[[File:Kansas1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A {{w|spinet}} piano.\n|This may have been referencing J.W. Jenkins Music Company, which selled spinet pianos from the Elburn Piano Company.\n|-\n! {{w|Kentucky}}\n|[[File:Kentucky1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A cloud.\n|While there are no direct relations between Kentucky and clouds, it's location and weather conditions can produce a plethora of interesting cloud formations.\n|-\n! {{w|Louisiana}}\n|[[File:Louisiana1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A boot with some gum stuck to the bottom of it.\n| In grade schools, Louisiana is often remembered via its shape, being very similar to a boot. \n|-\n! {{w|Maine}}\n|[[File:Maine1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A Vulcan salute.\n|Maine's camp sunshine has had Star Trek related events in the past, including the opportunity to appear in a film.\n|-\n! {{w|Maryland}}\n|[[File:Maryland1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A wolf howling to the moon, upside down.\n|Maryland used to have wolves, but they were extirpated in the mid-1800's from excessive hunting; In the present day, only coyotes and coy-wolves are present in the wild.\n|-\n! {{w|Massachusetts}}\n|[[File:Massachusetts1079.png|200x200px]]\n|An elephant, being ridden by a man, carrying tea.\n|Might be a reference to the Boston Tea Party, which occurred in Massachusetts, and the Republican political party. The man seems to be wearing a tricorn hat.\n|-\n! {{w|Michigan}}\n|[[File:Michigan1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A mitten for the lower portion, an eagle for the {{w|Upper Peninsula of Michigan}}.\n| In grade schools, Michigan is often remembered via its shape, being very similar to a glove.\n|-\n! {{w|Minnesota}}\n|[[File:Minnesota1079.png|200x200px]]\n|$160 in $20 USD bills, tied together.\n|This could be a pun on the name of the state, as 'Moneysota.'\n|-\n! {{w|Mississippi}}\n|[[File:Mississippi1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A moai head facing west.\n| This is a mirrored image of Alabama, referencing the fact that the two states appear symmetrical at a glance.\n|-\n! {{w|Missouri}}\n|[[File:Missouri1079.png|200x200px]]\n|Georgia.\n|The outline of the state of Georgia, with a pair of {{w|Georgia Peach|Georgia peaches}}. This is paired with Georgia, which contains an outline of the state of Missouri.\n|-\n! {{w|Montana}}\n|[[File:Montana1079.png|200x200px]]\n|One half of a muffin, sideways.\n|Muffins, especially ones with huckleberries, are a common treat in Montana.\n|-\n! {{w|Nebraska}}\n|[[File:Nebraska1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A blue VW type 2 with mattresses sticking out the back.\n|This may be a reference to the {{w|Great Depression}}, where violent {{w|Dust storm|dust storms}} would sweep across the Midwest, destroying entire farms and forcing people to move west in search of jobs. During this time, many families would pack up all their belongings and move, which the VW type 2 may be modelling in this image.\n|-\n! {{w|Nevada}}\n|[[File:Nevada1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A clothes iron.\n|Nevada has a history of iron ore mining, so it may likely be a play on their similar names.\n|-\n! {{w|New Hampshire}}\n|[[File:NewHampshire1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A tall brick factory building.\n| There are many brick mill buildings in Manchester, the largest city in the state. During the industrial revolution, New Hampshire was a major player in the textile industry.\n|-\n! {{w|New Jersey}}\n|[[File:NewJersey1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A bent-over old person. He is carrying a cane.\n|This may be referring to the state's growing percentage of elderly individuals. However, it could also just be a joke about the state's name being ''New'' Jersey.\n|-\n! {{w|New Mexico}}\n|[[File:NewMexico1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A liquid container labeled for something of unusual and silly danger.\n|This may be a reference to the many nuclear tests conducted In New Mexico during the {{w|Cold War}}. See the [[#Transcript|Transcript section]] to read the labels on the container.\n|-\n! {{w|New York}}\n|[[File:NewYork1079.png|200x200px]]\n|A hybrid transmission with standard manual-style gears and a torque converter sliced in half.\n|The Northern states, especially around Michigan, are known for their history of auto manufacturing.
