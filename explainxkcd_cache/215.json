This is used to symbolize that the character has accepted the end of the relationship and is ready to move on, no longer pining for their loss or seeking to restore the relationship.\n\nThe first three panels imply that [[Cueball]] was presumably in a now-terminated relationship with [[Megan]]. The final panel shows him using the Unix command 'userdel' to delete her user account from his computer. The joke here is that he considers this to be a significant part of accepting that she is no longer a part of his life, where most people would consider it a routine administrative task.\n\nThe title text refers to Cueball's thankfulness that he never gave Megan the password to the administrator ('root') account on the computer. It is unclear why this is; he might be worried that she would have used the access to perform [[340|malicious actions]] after the breakup, or simply glad to be spared the need to change the root password. Alternately, it could be a metaphor for marriage and/or a closer emotional relationship, and he is glad that he did not allow her an even greater hold on his heart before the breakup (which would, of course, have entailed commensurately more pain when she did leave him). Not sharing the root password is indicative of a lack of trust in their relationship, which could be a factor in the initial breakdown.\n\nThis was only the second time the [[Megan#Name|name Megan]] was used in xkcd, the first time being in [[159: Boombox]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball is holding a picture of himself and Megan in a heart; it has been ripped down the middle, separating the two people.]\n\n:[Cueball sits at computer, looking at the picture.]\n\n:[The panel has been inverted. Cueball still sits at the computer with the picture in front of him and his head drooped.]\n\n:[Cueball types on the computer.]\n:Text from computer: <code>root@homebox:~# userdel megan</code>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:Romance]]"
