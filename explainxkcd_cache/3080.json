They are used in a wide range of fields to produce high-resolution images of surfaces, enabling analysis of materials, structures, and even trace evidence. Since [[Megan]] and [[Cueball]] find electrons too small to work with, they have created a macroscopic version using tennis balls instead. The tennis ball launcher uses a similar mechanism to a scanning electron microscope: it fires tennis balls, instead of electrons, over a wide range of heights, and detects objects obstructing the stream (in this case a person) by the noises generated on impact. However, this would mostly be 'useful' in scanning things at a macroscopic level, so is not really a microscope. {{w|Computational microscopy}} can be used to increase the resolution of an image beyond the size of the sampling medium by extensively analyzing details of interactions, and a tennis ball microscope could potentially be used to tune such algorithms at an observable scale — the joke of striking a human, as well as the manual single-ball operation, imply that [[Randall]] did not intend this use.\n\nMegan and Cueball have detected a person using their device, by the fact that it generated two yells during the scan, possibly from impacting the person's face and another sensitive part of their body. They intend to repeat the experiment to determine the person's height, by working out the angle of the tennis balls that generate the yells. Combined with the velocity and time to impact, this should give them enough information to work out the height above ground at impact and the distance from the launcher. The joke is that this height measurement could probably have been completed with a visual assessment, and with far more accuracy than using tennis balls to approximate their height. Most humans work with large-scale objects in their day-to-day lives and hence do not see by using a microscope, although the lens in the eye operates on the same principle as the objective lens in an optical one. This method is also likely to be problematic, as the person would likely duck or run away in response to being bombarded with tennis balls, affecting future measurements. This is known as the {{w|Observer effect (physics)|Observer Effect}} as well as a normal {{w|Sampling (signal processing)#Practical considerations|consideration of sampling}}. (It may also be why the 'scanning' is done from the top down, as early {{tvtropes|GroinAttack|low-hitting projectiles}} might reduce the height that later projectiles can detect.)\n\nThe title text is a reference to {{w|scanning tunneling microscope}}s, which take advantage of the {{w|quantum tunnelling}} effect. In this case, the tennis balls were actually tunneling through the wall, creating holes in the process, which is not what tunneling electrons would do. Tunneling is a non-intuitive quantum phenomenon whereby particles may \"teleport\" across a barrier they would otherwise bounce off of, but it requires a number of particles of extremely low mass to exploit quantum effects, with a comparatively thin barrier, to be observable. It would not be reasonable to produce this effect at tennis ball scale with any typical building wall, but naively attempting to do so by launching tennis balls at a sufficiently high velocity (the required speed dependant upon whether they are aimed at the likes of plasterboard, brick or concrete) could lead to damaging the wall instead. \"Scanning Tunneling Tennis Ball Microscope\" capable of launching tennis balls at velocities, sufficient to do large holes in lab walls (presumably, concrete), could be very useful as a weapon—especially if tennis balls were swapped for stronger projectiles (e.g. tennis-ball-sized lead or steel bullets).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball fires eight tennis ball at decreasing heights using a tennis ball machine, which makes four \"thunk\" noises. Megan is standing behind him. The tennis ball machine has a container for tennis balls at the top, which is connected to a tube where the balls are launched. Behind the machine is a handle that Cueball holds with both hands to control the machine, and at the bottom is a stand with two legs.]\n\n:[Cueball has stopped firing tennis balls and is resting his hand on the handle of the machine. Ten noises come from the right side of the panel:]\n:Bonk\n:Bonk\n:Bonk\n:Bonk\n:Bonk\n:OW!\n:Bonk\n:OW!\n:Bonk\n:Bonk\n:[Megan has her hand to her chin.]\n:Megan: Ok, there's definitely a person over there. Let's do one more pass to try to measure their height.\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Electrons are small and hard to work with, so some scientists have developed a scanning tennis ball microscope instead.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n{{w|Electron tomography#Atomic Electron Tomography (AET)|Atomic electron tomography}} uses electrons to precisely identify and map the individual atoms of a sample and is leading to extensive novel materials research.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Physics]]"
