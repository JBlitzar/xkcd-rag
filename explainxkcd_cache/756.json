Such change came with development of the internet and \"new media\" as source of information (websites, blogs, social networks), which pushed \"old media\" back and diminished their significance. In their attempt to return to relevance, \"old media\" tried to copy the opinion part of the news, taking what could be considered a bad thing from them. The humor of the comic comes from news anchor cutting to an opinion piece from people on the street, thus proving the politician's point.\n\nThe title text illustrates what [[Randall]] sees as the problem with this approach.  The new media, for the large part, consists of uninformed opinions from people of [[1386: People are Stupid|average intelligence]] and abilities.  However, the sheer volume and immediacy of information is threatening to destroy old media, much as the iceberg destroyed the Titanic.  You don't join with the iceberg or try to emulate its methods; the iceberg does not care, it's too big and will destroy you anyway. If possible, then the best way to survive is to steer far away to avoid it and find your own path.  (Ironically, the Titanic sank because it steered away just enough for the iceberg to scrape its side, tearing into multiple compartments.  If it had steered straight into the iceberg, although the bow would have been severely damaged, the ship might have stayed afloat.)  Old media must present us with something better than new media (for example: informed, analytical, intelligent), otherwise we have no need of them.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball as a news anchor reads from a paper.
