A piece of origami can be made to appear like one of the various images, diagrams, or artistic depictions of a black hole. It seems black-hole-like origami does exist, as created by [https://parchmentandallthingspaper.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/folding/ Richard Sweeney]. The implication is that while the linked origami only resembles a black hole, Randall's instructions create an actual {{w|black hole}} out of origami paper.\n\nThe instructions just repeat the operation of folding the paper in half, ignoring the increases in thickness and difficulty of folding that occur. In addition, the idea that one can create a black hole with one's bare hands is far-fetched. The difficult details in actually carrying out such a thing are left implied and unexplained - and they turn out to be surprisingly complex.\n\nThe number of folds is likely based on the {{w|Schwarzschild radius}} of a piece of paper. The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic of every object that depends on the object's mass. If an object is compressed into the volume of a sphere with its characteristic Schwarzschild radius, then that object will become a black hole. (More specifically, it will become a {{w|Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole}}.) As such, if a piece of paper were folded sufficiently many times so as to fit within its own Schwarzschild radius, it would become a black hole. However, this would require compressing the paper into a flat sheet at every step, as otherwise the folded paper would double in thickness at each step, greatly exceeding its Schwarzschild radius. Indeed, it would need to be compressed beyond the thinness of the original sheet of paper.\n\nIf we assume standard {{w|origami paper#Kami|kami origami paper}} with a side length of 15 cm and a weight of 70 grams per square meter, we get a mass of 1.575 grams, corresponding to a Schwarzschild radius of 2.339×10<sup>-30</sup> meters. It follows that, ignoring the paper's thickness, we would need to halve each side length -log<sub>2</sub>((2 × 2.339×10<sup>-30</sup> m)/0.15 m) = 94.69 times to fit each side length within the \"Schwarzschild diameter\" of the paper. Using the square folding technique in the comic, this would take 95 * 2 = 190 steps to complete, the exact number given in the comic. Note that the radius of the resulting black hole is 10<sup>-15</sup> times the size of the {{w|Proton#Charge radius|charge radius of a proton}}. {{w|Micro black holes|Black holes this small}}, if they can be created at all, are believed to quickly disintegrate by losing energy via {{w|Hawking radiation}}. In this case, if those predictions are correct, it would result in an energy release equivalent to 33.8 kilotons of TNT, roughly equal to two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima, in approximately 1.57×10<sup>-28</sup> seconds. (This is the energy equivalent of the mass of the paper, given by ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>.)\n\nIn actual fact, it's not possible to fold a piece of paper this many times,{{cn}} because the amount of paper 'wasted' in each fold will quickly surpass the length and width of the paper. For an ordinary letter-sized (A4 or 8.5x11) sheet, the maximum number of folds is 7. The [https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/494571-most-times-to-fold-a-piece-of-paper world record] for the total number of folds of a sheet of paper is 12, done with a length of tissue paper 3/4 mile (4000 ft, 1200 m) long. A group of MIT students demonstrated 13 folds using multiple miles of paper, but had to lay separate pieces together as it made them too thick to tape them. Materials other than paper, such as thin foil, can be folded more times. Not only that but, as the title text alludes, prior to reaching any creation of a black hole, the pressures generated by the resulting {{w|Nuclear fusion#Confinement in thermonuclear fusion|fusion of its atoms}} must be overcome. Electron and neutron degeneracy pressure would also have to be overcome.\n\nNaively, the instructions would produce a paper stack of shrinking area, growing in thickness exponentially. This would become impossible long before the 190 folds in half that the instructions require. In fact, with a paper thickness of around 0.1 mm, for it to be possible to fold it 190 times, the sum of the lengths and width of the paper would need to be around 10<sup>110</sup> meters, a good 10<sup>83</sup> times the diameter of the observable universe.\n\nThe {{w|mathematics of paper folding}} were augmented with [https://web.archive.org/web/20051102085038/http://pomonahistorical.org/12times.htm work by a California high school student in 2001] who wrote equations that [https://web.archive.org/web/20211116013626/http://teachersofindia.org/sites/default/files/folding_paper_in_half.pdf  related the size of paper to the maximum number of folds it could make], which has not yet exceeded the low teens in human competition. This could be exceeded by scoring the paper to cut and flatten the outer layers of the folds, but its thickness would immediately surpass its length, and compressing it beyond the size of its fibers would require some way to hold it together.\n\nSince this folded paper would typically have growing thickness, the instructions wouldn't really create a black hole unless one somehow additionally compressed the paper commensurate with its decrease in width and length. Perhaps the comic imagines the folded paper retaining the same thickness as a single sheet; then the density and pressure required would likely reach a point where fusion between hydrogen atoms begins to occur (a la the very first ''[[what if? (blog)|what if?]]'' article, ''{{what if|1|Relativistic Baseball}}''). This is later alluded to in the title text.\n\n==Transcript==\n:How to fold a '''''real''''' origami black hole:\n\n:Step 1.\n:[A square sheet of paper with a dashed line going across the middle and an arrow pointing from one half to the other, indicating that it should be folded in that direction.]\n\n:[In each step from Step 2. to Step 9., the paper is shown folded in half again and depicted in the same manner as Step 1.
