Included in the cloud hardware are (from left to right) a {{w|Macintosh}}, several old laptops, an {{w|Alienware}} tower, a {{w|Nintendo}} {{w|Virtual Boy}}, an old desktop with the cover off, and an {{w|Atari, Inc.|Atari}} {{w|Pong#Home_version|Pong Console}}. He named the company after xkcd, xkcloud being a [[:category:Portmanteau|portmanteau]] of \"[[xkcd]]\" and \"{{w|Cloud computing|cloud}}\", here pronounced XK-cloud. The portmanteau incidentally still contains all four xkcd letters in the correct order: xkcLOUd. This was later reused for the xkcd keyboard in [[2150: XKeyboarCD]], where the word Keyboard, has an X before the word and a C before the D with the xkcd letters capitalized. \n\nAfter providing his services to various (very big) companies ({{w|Facebook}}, {{w|Twitter}} and {{w|Tumblr}}), that are very concerned with securing the users data, his setup failed (some portions may even have caught fire? He is not sure). This has caused him to lose the data he was required to preserve as part of his service. He thus requests the readers help to make up and re-imagine the lost data by pressing the large red button at the bottom of the comic. Preferably ''before Facebook & Co notice we lost it.''\n\nIf you take him up on his request and push the button, you will be taken to a \"survey\" where you will get the chance to help by either trying to combine a posted picture with its lost text or, vice versa, by trying to combine a posted text with its lost picture. In either case you get a selection of texts/pictures to choose from but can also choose to write your own text or even draw the picture. After doing this you get to see this combination in the news feed together with several other posts (which other people have helped combine from other lost data). And then you can continue helping as long as you like.\n\nThe content of the \"surveys\" appear to come from reader submissions, and are different upon every click. This is thus both an interactive and a dynamic comic with only the first picture shown on top of this page. By inviting the xkcd readers to add content that will be displayed in the comic later, the result of all the interactions leads to the generation of {{w|Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced content}}.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the reader-created drawings or captions are, in fact, being cycled into the surveys and feeds, or if the displayed items were all created by Randall and the reader-created content is simply discarded. With the huge amount of different comments and drawings that already appeared on the first day, and since especially the drawings look like they are created in the simple Paint app (i.e. not by Randall), there can be no doubt that most of the content is created by the users. However he must have made some pictures to get it all started, and at least one of these can be seen [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures posted by users#Randall's pictures|here]].\n\nThis comic resembles last years April Fools' Day comic [[1350: Lorenz]] where user input also generated a very complex crowd-sourced comic. In both comics it was possible to create a [[#Permalink|permalink]] to save a given version of the comic to share with others. An earlier comic was also related to problems with cloud computing: [[908: The Cloud]].\n\nDue to the very complex nature of this comic, there are lots of details that may need an explanation. This can be found in the sections below. Note that there have been some [[#Changes and bugs|changes and bugs]] regarding this comic after it was first released. Some of the pictures that are referenced below were saved before these changes took place. So consult [[#Changes in the comic|these changes]] if the pictures do not match the expectations.\n\n===Extra xkcloud pages===\nSince this comic is so big and complicated, extra pages have been created to include much more information than is wished for on this main page (which is already of considerable size). These pages are listed here for convenience, but they are also listed in the relevant sections below:\n*[[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages]] - Pictures representing the other three main types of pages.\n*[[1506: xkcloud/Pictures posted by users]] - Some of the pictures of the comic created by users.\n*[[1506: xkcloud/Transcript]] - A transcript of these pages with explanations for the reason for data loss and other features, such as usernames, like buttons, etc.\n\n===Functionality===\n*Pressing the red button at the '''front page''' (shown here above) links to one of two interactive survey pages (see [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages|the pictures]] of all types of pages.).\n**All these pages have a news feed below the top post. This will be described [[#News feed|here below]].\n*The '''Lost picture page''' (see several [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help.21 We lost the picture page|pictures here]]) asks the reader to indicate which of eight '''line-drawings''' (see several [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures posted by users|examples here]]) best matches a given caption, or the reader can create their own drawing.\n**This can be done on the '''Draw one your self sub-page''' (see several [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Draw one your self page|pictures here]]) in a simple web-based \"{{w|Paint (software)|paint}}\"-style {{w|Web application|app}}.\n***Note that someone found a way to copy a picture into the comic. See at least one example of this [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures posted by users#Copy pasted pictures|here]].\n*The '''Lost text page''' (see several [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help! We lost the text page|pictures here]]) asks the reader to indicate which of eight captions best matches the given drawing, or the reader can create their own caption and submit this instead. \n**These captions are user generated. See transcribed examples of these '''post from users''' [[1506: xkcloud/Transcript#Post from users|here]]. \n*In either case, at the top of the pages, we are given the '''Reason for the data loss'''. And there are many different reasons (all by account of Randall).\n**A list of transcribed reasons (with explanations included) [[1506: xkcloud/Transcript#Reason for data loss|can be found here]].\n*After completing the \"survey\" you go to a new page appears:\n*The '''Help us recover more data''' page (see several [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help us recover more data page|pictures here]]) has yet another red button like the front page, but on this page it is at the top of the page, saying exactly ''Help us recover more data''.\n**By pushing this button you go to one of the two \"Lost\" pages mentioned above.\n*It is possible to go back to the front page at any time by clicking the picture of Cueball sitting behind his desk in the same way as he does in the first picture on the front page. \n**Cueball is always present to the left on all pages after the front page. \n**But if you go back to the front page like this, then if you again click on the \"original\" red button to return to help with the recovery, you will always go back to the same page you came from (with the same posts in the news feed and if it is one of the lost data pages also with the same post to fix.) \n**You can thus only get to a new survey page by finishing the current task (or pressing a permalink as [[#Permalink|discussed below]]).\n\n===News feed===\n*Below the \"survey\" or the post you just recovered (to begin with), you will be presented with a listing similar to a {{w|Facebook features#News Feed|Facebook news feed}}, listing six posts of the line-drawings apparently tagged with the captions as paired up by other users survey results.  \n**The posts are made by apparently '''fictional randomly-named readers''' (see transcribed examples [[1506: xkcloud/Transcript#User names|of names here]]).\n**But there are only 20 '''user pictures'''. See these (and why it is known that there are only 20) as well as a description of these pictures [[1506: xkcloud/Transcript#User pictures|here]]. \n**The posts are accompanied by a button similar to Facebook's \"'''{{w|Like button}}'''\" but here the button is labeled with different words which are all {{w|synonyms}} for ''[http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/want want]'' (see transcribed [[1506: xkcloud/Transcript#Like buttons|list of words here]]). So not \"to like\" but \"to want\" is the new thing in this version of Facebook.\n*After the first time you recovered a post, there will thus be seven posts on the ''Help us recover more data'' page, six new posts below the one you just helped complete. \n**The only difference when you click this pages red button (rather than when you start for the first time at the front page) is that there will now be seven posts below the one you need to fix. \n**These seven posts are the same as those you had on the previous page, including your own at the top.\n\n===Permalink===\n*Next to each post there is a text ''Link'' above the \"Want\" button above the picture. (This goes for all three types of pages mentioned above.)\n*The \"Link\" is an actual link of the type that is called a \"'''{{w|permalink}}'''\", a portmanteau of \"permanent-link\". \n*If you wish to \"save\" any given post for future reference (for instance one with your own drawing) you can do so by copying down this link.\n**Last year's April Fools' Day comic, [[1350: Lorenz]], was the first time the [[1350: Lorenz#Permalink|concept of a permalink]] was used on xkcd. \n**The permalink option did not appear in the comic until very late in the afternoon on April 1. The \"Link\" was thus not present on the pictures refereed above. (See [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#After 18:00 ET on April 1st|these pictures]] instead). \n*Pressing the \"Link\" next to any given post takes you to the page of the permalink:\n**This page will show a version of the ''Help us recover more data'' page with the chosen post as the top post.\n**When you click the permalink it takes you to this \"new\" page and this page will '''not''' show all the posts from the page where you chose it.\n**Only the post you saved via the \"Link\" next to it. \n***All the other post will again just be chosen at random, and these will change again every time you reload this page via the saved permalink.\n***Even the text on the \"want\" buttons also continues to change.\n***The user name and user picture stay the same though.\n*As an '''example''' of a [http://xkcd.com/1506/#post/50b47c70-3a7c-504d-bcc0-60597338e999 permalink] this is a post saying: ''We told Iran that atomic energy is unsafe'' for a picture of a black devil and two Cueballs next to a road.\n**Originally the user name was {{w|Mark Zuckerberg}} but this has since changed to ''Destiny1983'' next to a user picture of a stick figure with black hair on a skateboard.\n**See [[#Changes in the comic|Changes in the comic]] below for a possible reason.\n**Also please make a note here, if the user name and picture is no longer the same.\n*A huge '''collection of permalinks''' with link to the pictures have been amassed here:\n**[[1506: xkcloud/Table of Permalinks|Table with permalinks]] contains all known images and captions at least once. (2179 feed entries, featuring 1481 different pictures and 1935 different captions, as of 2015-04-24)\n**[[1506: xkcloud/List of Permalinks|List of Permalinks]] contains all known permalinks (25585 links, as of 2015-04-24)\n\n====Details on the permalink====\n*Since the post from the page where you choose the first permalink is reloaded... Can you then only save one post at a time?\n*The answer is \"no\" - you can save all posts on any given page.\n**For each \"Link\" text on a given page, there has already been generated a unique permalink {{w|URL}}.\n**Thus you can copy any permalink via the \"Link\", without actually pressing the \"Link\" to obtain the permalink for a given post.\n**Furthermore, since this may be the only comic where you can copy the text, you can simple mark the entire page and copy paste it into a document that contains formatting. If you do this then you will have all the text, pictures and most importantly the permalinks for all the posts.\n*If you click the Link and go to the permalink page there will be seven posts, six new and the one you just saved.\n**The behavior of the posts is very strange from here if you press more permalinks on this first permalink page\n**Also it will not be the same again after this first time as compared to if you continue to help recover more data and use the permalink later.\n**On this first permalink page, where your chosen post is at the top, if you click on another post's permalink the following will happen:\n***The post you originally choose disappears from the page, as the new chosen post is moved to the top.\n***The other five post remains in the same order, so there are not only 6 posts.\n***If you continue to choose the other posts one at a time, they will simply exchange place with the one at the top, with all six posts remaining.\n***Once you have been through all of them, then the order of the post has been determined. \n****So if you click on a \"Link\" that you have already once activated, then this page will just reload, and the post will have the same order as last time.\n****This is only until you choose to reload, or when you load such a permalink later. Then again it will just be the chosen post, and then always six other new posts.\n**If you then at some point move on via the red button you kind of stay in the permalink page, now just with new options to choose from.\n***If you then create a new post, six new posts will be loaded below.\n***When you click on a permalink at this point, there will not be any reloading of the post (because it is not the first time).\n***Any post you click will move to the top, but all the other (six this time) will stay, the top post just moving down to another position. \n****It is not always a direct exchange. Sometimes the top post moves to another position and then pushes the others down until they reach the now calculated position of the post now at the top.\n\n===Our policy regarding your personal data===\n:On every of the pages after the front page Cueball sits at his desk labeled XKCD.COM\n:Below him are xkcloud's policy:\n:''Our policy regarding your personal data'':\n*Please stop sending us your personal data\n*We are running out of places to put it\n*Is this even yours?\n*Does anyone recognize whose data this is?\n*Oh jeez never mind here comes more data\n*Why are you doing this\n*Please stop\n*Help\n:As can be seen he is getting desperate because people keep sending them more data. \n::He has no place to store it. \n::And he do not even know who the data belongs to. \n::So now he hopes someone else recognize the data (what you are doing if you choose to help).\n::In the end he simply pleads for people to stop and then shouts ''Help''.\n:If you click on the desk you are sent back to the front page of the comic.\n:But below Help is their real contact detail [[#Don't contact us|Don't contact us]]:\n\n===Don't contact us===\n*At the same time the permalink appeared, there was also suddenly a new link on all other pages than the front page, written in a very light grey font. It can be hard to see on some screens and has possibly changed colour to become harder to see since it first appeared.\n**It is located right beneath ''help'' at the bottom of the list of problems written under ''our policy regarding your data'' right beneath Cueball at his desk to the left (see [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#After 18:00 ET on April 1st|picture here]]).\n**In some cases, tilting the screen will help to make it visible- if you still can't see it, you can still find it with the cursor, or you can also highlight the text below Cueball down to make it easier to see.\n*The link text reads '''Don't contact us''' and links to [https://euphoria.io/room/xkcd a now-defunct chatroom formerly hosted at euphoria.io].\n*Click the [https://euphoria.io/room/xkcd/ link] to open an xkcd chatroom on Euphoria. (See a [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#xkcd chat forum|picture here]]).\n**Several xkcd users began posting on the original chatroom at around 18:00 {{w|Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time}} (Randall's timezone). \n**After picking a username, you can chat in real time with the other users. You can change your username by clicking on it near the bottom of the screen and entering a new one.\n**On November 23rd 2023, euphoria shut down. The xkcd room lives on in the form of a new instance on [https://euphoria.leet.nu/room/xkcd/ euphleet].\n''We are open for anyone to chat here. Hey you! Come right over and say hello to us! ~<s>[https://euphoria.io/room/xkcd euphoria.io/room/xkcd]</s> https://euphoria.leet.nu/room/xkcd/ ''\n(PS. Please say thank you to @Xyzzy on it; He did make the new chat, after all. (From @KurzgesagtDuck11. (Now @Geometrist.))\n====Undocumented Feature====\n*This chat room is reminiscent of the one in a comic [[1305: Undocumented Feature]].\n*As mentioned above, this chat room is hard to access! You need to know that there is a hidden link on the pages you get to by pressing a red button in {{xkcd|1506}}.\n**You do get to choose your username (this is not the case in Undocumented Feature), but you could change it. Or others could use the same.\n*When it came out, many users began using the chatroom.\n*Maybe Randall timed these extra features for when people came back from work all over the US.\n\n==Changes and bugs==\nDuring the first day there occurred several changes to the comic, and also some bugs very present.\n\n===Changes in the comic===\n*All the changes mentioned here occurred during April 1 on the release day:\n*Since being [[Media:Originalxkcloud.png|originally posted]] the words \"Click here\" were relatively quickly added in large text to the top of the red button followed by the word \"to\" being added to the beginning of the existing text.\n**The text changed from \n***''Help us recover user data before Facebook & Co notice we lost it.'' to \n***''Click here to help us recover user data before Facebook & Co notice we lost it.''\n**The reason for this is most likely that too few users understood that they could enter a second part of the comic by clicking on the red button.\n*Late in the afternoon on April 1 (around 18:00 {{w|Eastern Time Zone|ET}}) several changes occurred to the pages that can be reached from the front page:\n**The [[#Permalink|permalink]] option appeared\n**The link that says [[#Don't contact us|Don't contact us]] appeared under the text beneath Cueball's desk with a link to an xkcd chat room.\n***Though only for the text font to fade out to being almost invisible again later on April 1.\n**The alignment of the text right beneath Cueball's desk changed. (Compare this [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help us recover more data page|before picture]] with this [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#After 18:00 ET on April 1st|picture after]] 18:00 ET).\n**The number of posts increased from 3 or 4 to 6 or 7. (See the pictures above — scroll down to see the relevant after picture).\n**Also the number of pictures and text to choose from increased from five to eight (as can also be seen by comparing the pictures found here for before — for [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help! We lost the text page|text]] and for [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#Help! We lost the picture page|picture]] — with the [[1506: xkcloud/Pictures of other pages#After 18:00 ET on April 1st|pictures after]] (scroll down as mentioned before)).\n***The reason he increased the number of posts (both to see and to choose from) could simply be because there where now is so many possible posts that the risk of seeing the same is smaller even with 6 posts.\n*Sometime on April 2, Randall made an update to the names list.\n**That this happened could be seen since the names shown in permalinks did change. And since then they have stayed constant. \n**For instance,  [http://xkcd.com/1506/#post/3c34fb48-1a07-51d2-a81d-5257a3681024 this permalink], to an atomic bomb explosion with the caption ''that's one nasty burn!'', had the name \"Lauren Ibsen Dolores Amit\" (a play on \"{{w|Lorem ipsum|Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet}}\"), but then displayed the name \"Virginia2006\" next to a picture of a man with black hair. Currently, it displays the name \"Michelleii\" next to the same image.\n***(If this changes please make a note - then the names list have either been changed again, or the assumption that the names stay constant is wrong.)\n\n===Bugs===\nFrom time to time, instead of the interactive page there is a page with [[Media:three dots only.png|three dots only]]. Also, at around 18:00, when all the changes occurred, the xkcd page did not work properly. The chat room was also overloaded at this time.\n\n==Transcript==\n:'''[This transcript only transcribes what can be seen in the first picture shown at the top of the explanation here.
