[[Megan]] is clearly excited as she screams \"Woooo!\", but [[Cueball]], in true nerd fashion, thinks in base-2, saying that there are just 24 to go until a \"big round-number milestone\". The joke is that during programming, base-2 is used more often than base-10, making milestones powers of two rather than powers of 10. Where 1000 is a round number in base 10 (10<sup>3</sup>), 1024 is a round number in base 2 (2<sup>10</sup>). Binary is also referenced in the \"Connect the Dots\" puzzle, explained below.\n\nIn the 1000 comic [[Randall]] included [[404: Not Found]], see why in the explanation for this comic. This comic strengthens the fact that Randall did indeed count 404 as a \"real\" comic. \n\n===The 1000 characters===\nEach of the characters/drawings is numbered on this page:\n*[[1000: 1000 Comics/Numbered images]]\nThey are described on this page:\n*[[1000: 1000 Comics/1000 characters]]\n\n===Connect the Dots===\nThere is a \"Connect the Dots\" puzzle hidden within the comic. However, rather than using the conventional decimal system numbering which would start with 1 and count up, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...  This \"Connect the Dots\" puzzle starts with 0 as a programmer would do and counts up in binary numerical order - 0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,1001 and back to 0. The revealed image forms the shape of a heart. This fits well with the title text where feeling less alone can equate to feeling loved.\n\n[[File:1000 comics binary.png]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:[1000 characters, numerous of which have appeared previously in other comics, are arranged to create the number \"1000\". Two more people stand in the foreground commenting on the formation. There are several comments amongst these 1000 but here are only written the text that can be read from the small version shown above.]\n:1000\n:Megan: ''Woooo!''\n:Cueball: Wowâ€”Just 24 to go until a big round-number milestone!\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n<!-- The following categories refer to the main details of the comic, as visible in regular image size, without zooming in. -->\n[[Category:Large drawings]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Binary]]\n\n<!-- Categories below are related to the 1000 characters.
