The premise is that a young \"trainer\" goes out to explore the world and catch Pokémon: fanciful wild creatures that come in many varieties, ranging from [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rhydon_(Pok%C3%A9mon) armoured dinosaurs that have drills for horns] to [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Genesect_(Pok%C3%A9mon) robotic bugs that change their type depending on the items they are holding]. When the trainer comes across wild Pokémon or other trainers, they use their Pokémon to fight each other.\n\nIn this comic, [[Randall]] claims that \"I'm not really into Pokémon\" can serve as an all-purpose phrase of condescending dismissal. The implied insult to the thing being dismissed can include:\n* Childishness. Although it does have a significant adult following, the ''Pokémon'' franchise was and is mainly targeted at children.\n* Frivolousness. The essential goal of ''Pokémon'' games, summed up in the slogan \"Gotta Catch 'Em All,\" is to catch Pokémon for the sake of having them.\n* Commercialism. ''Pokémon'' is a sprawling franchise that periodically releases new iterations, which (at least to a non-fan) can seem much like more of the same, only existing to make money. At present, the ''Pokémon'' universe contains {{w|List of Pokémon|over 1,000}} different types of Pokémon.\n* Absurdity. As mentioned, the names and designs of individual Pokémon can be quite fanciful; \"absurd\" would be a more unkind way to put it.\n\nThe example in the comic is [[Black Hat]] dismissing {{w|Ubuntu}}, an open-source computer operating system. Ubuntu may have been particularly chosen as ''specifically'' suitable for the \"Pokémon dismissal\" for reasons such as:\n* The name \"Ubuntu,\" which (like the names of Pokémon) can sound strange or silly. Individual Ubuntu releases also have animal-themed names (like \"Hoary Hedgehog\" and \"Saucy Salamander\").\n* The name \"Ubuntu\" sounds like a Pokemon [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Region region.]\n* Its release schedule; new Ubuntu releases come out every six months, which might (like ''Pokémon'') be unfavourably described as putting out more of the same in new packaging.\n* A notion that people try Ubuntu (and other {{w|Linux distribution}}s) just for the sake of doing so, like catching all the Pokémon.\n\nThe title text refers to the complications that new software releases can have on computers, especially if either the release is an alpha or beta release, or if the computer is rather old. Randall specifically mentions {{w|Ubuntu 6.10}} and {{w|Firefox 2.0}}, both of which were officially released around two weeks ''after'' this comic was posted, so the versions causing problems were certainly pre-release editions. While Randall does not detail any specific issues, the title text may paint a picture of two computer programs fighting each other inside the computer and making a mess in the process, as if they were Pokémon.\n\nOther comics which advocate using catch-all phrases as standard responses for any comment:\n*[[174: That's What SHE Said]]\n*[[559: No Pun Intended]]\n*[[1022: So It Has Come To This]]\n*[[1215: Insight]]\n*[[1627: Woosh]]\n*[[1656: It Begins]]\n\n==Transcript==\n:I have found the perfect phrase for condescendingly dismissing anything:\n:Cueball: Have you seen the new Ubuntu release?\n:Black Hat: Nah, I'm not really into Pokémon.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:Pokémon]]"
