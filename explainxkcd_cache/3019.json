Every day, another \"window\" is opened (e.g. a cardboard flap is opened along perforations), revealing a small present (traditionally, just a thematic picture or chocolate). While the religious season of {{w|Advent}} traditionally begins four Sundays before Christmas, most Advent calendars begin on December 1st for simplicity. In 2024, when this comic was published, the Advent season coincidentally starts on December 1st. Advent calendars usually have either 24 or 25 doors (ending on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day), depending on manufacturer's choice and/or local tradition. \n\nIn this comic, Randall has devised an Advent calendar that contains multiple smaller Advent calendars, each of which contains the same number of items as there are days left until (and ''including'') Christmas Day. By the time he reaches Christmas, he will have 325 different items, or 350 if counting the sub-calendars. The calendar is shown as it might be on December 2<sup>nd</sup>, the date of publication of this strip. The \"window\" in the upper left, presumed to be for the 1<sup>st</sup> of December, has 25 sub-windows, of which two are open. (One would have been opened on December 1<sup>st</sup> and the next for the day after.) The \"window\" 5<sup>th</sup> from the left in the bottom row, probably for December 2<sup>nd</sup>, has 24 sub-windows, of which one (that for the initial 2<sup>nd</sup>) is open.\n\nThe title text refers to {{w|The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas}}, a traditional Christmas carol in which the singer receives one set of gifts from their true love for each day of the Twelve Days of Christmas. On day one, they receive one gift, and on day ''n'', they receive again all the gifts they received on day ''n-1'', plus ''n'' copies of a new gift. The exact gifts given each day vary by version of the song, receiving 78 gifts on day 12, for a total of 364 gifts. For the Advent calendar Advent calendar, each day a number of items equal to the number of days left until Christmas are added. There are 364 items total in the 12 Days of Christmas, the final day itself having exceeded the gifts of the nested calendars (the sub-gift count being 325, and regardless of the 25 calendars also being included). However the advent calendar uses 25 days rather than just 12, hence the song's acceleration in number of gifts each day is much higher. The title text says “may” twice, either mistakenly, or maybe on purpose since the comic's name has word duplication.\n\nThe advent calendar's advent calendar gift total follows the {{w|triangular number}} sequence of all new gifts on a given day being one more than those the day before: on the first day, this is 1 (the first sub-gift of the first sub-calendar); on the second, we now have 3 (add two sub-gifts from two sub-calendars); on the third, we have 6 (three sub-gifts added), etc. The formula for the total on day ''n'' is <table style=\"display: inline-table; line-height: 0.6em; vertical-align: middle; font-size:9pt; text-size-adjust: none;\"><tr><td style=\"text-decoration: underline\">''n''(''n''+1)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td></tr></table>. For the Twelve Days song (which goes from the 25th of December to 5th of January), ''each day'' adds to the total the next ''triangular number'' in the sequence: +1=1, +3=4, +6=10, etc... The formula for this {{w|tetrahedral number}} (a 'pyramid of triangular numbers') is <table style=\"display: inline-table; line-height: 0.6em; vertical-align: middle; font-size:9pt; text-size-adjust: none;\"><tr><td style=\"text-decoration: underline\">''n''(''n''+1)(''n''+2)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">6</td></tr></table>, and matches a triple-nested meta-Advent Calendar's non-calendar gift count. This already starts in a more rapid escalation of gift-giving, immediately after the first day where both counts are at one item. However, due to the later start of the Twelve Days, one would have to extend the gift-giving patterns to the 17th Day Of Christmas (and thus the 41st day of Advent) for the number of ''true love'' gifts (969) to properly overtake the continuing meta-calendar's ones, with (902) or without (861) counting the sub-calendars as gifts. (The number of ultimate gifts in any quadruple-nested Advent Calendar would be <table style=\"display: inline-table; line-height: 0.6em; vertical-align: middle; font-size:9pt; text-size-adjust: none;\"><tr><td style=\"text-decoration: underline\">''n''(''n''+1)(''n''+2)(''n''+3)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">24</td></tr></table>, excluding all the calendars themselves.)\n\nIt is not clear what is inside each sub-calendar. The typical filling would be chocolate, however it could also be possible that the advent calendar advent calendars had even more advent calendars within. That this is not the case is revealed in the title text as, if they were (and were run concurrently), the number of (sub-sub-)gifts would always equal those in the song.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[On a grey board, there are 23 Advent calendars behind large \"windows\", numbered from 3 to 25, plus two open calendars with their covers torn off.]\n:[From top-left to bottom-right, the boxes are numbered as such: (opened), 14, 23, 16, 11, 3; 5, 24, 18, 7, 21; 10, 17, 4, 9, 22, 15, 12; 8, 20, 13, 25, (opened), 19, 6]\n:[Each calendar numbered ''n'' has 26−''n'' squares in it.]\n:[The open calendar on the top left has 25 squares, two of which are black.
