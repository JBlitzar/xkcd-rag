Don't remove this notice too soon.}}\n\nThe comic shows a {{w|directional drilling}} rig which will drill a hole through the {{w|lithosphere}} to create a {{w|borehole}} with a constant curvature. Normally, this could be for scientific study, or something functional like creating a well or installing a heat exchanger. In this case, though, the comic suggests that the borehole is being created so that the Earth can be fitted with a piercing like a giant ring. In many societies, piercings in humans are subject to age restrictions or recommendations; it appears that in the world of the comic, the same is true of planets, as it states that the Earth is now old enough to go ahead with this procedure. If so, then Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are probably also old enough [https://www.astronomy.com/science/how-old-each-planet-in-our-solar-system/], unless there is a different age requirement for gas giants.\n\nThe caption may draw on the idea of dating the {{w|age of Earth}} using geologic evidence. However, rather than determining the age with greater {{w|accuracy and precision}}, the fictional geologists have determined that the age falls into a certain developmental stage, as of a human life. In the real world, the {{w|geologic time scale}} does divide the Earth's history into units such as eons and eras. These may sound comparable to stages or years of one's life, but are defined by properties of the {{w|Geologic record|rock record}}&mdash;not by developmental milestones that all planets would be expected to go through. (The histories of other celestial bodies, like [https://planetary.org/space-images/geologic-time-scales-for Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon], are divided into different eras, based on unique geologic events that occurred on each.)\n\nThe title text plays on the normal warnings about piercings, replacing inflammation around the piercing with lava, and signs of infection such as pus, widening holes, or swelling with earthquakes and eruptions.\n\n==Transcript==\n\n:[One large panel, overlaid by two smaller ones in the corners, shows the Earth with an upward opening curve through its crust and mantle.]\n\n:Small panel 1: [Arrow pointing to a machine on tracks with an arm and a tube into the ground, with Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail nearby] Directional drilling rig\n\n:[Label on curve in the main panel]: Constant curvature borehole\n\n:Small panel 2: [Earth with a ring embedded onto it]\n\n:[Caption below the panel:]\n:Good news: Geologists have decided that Earth is finally old enough to get its first lithosphere piercing!\n{{comic discussion}}<noinclude>\n[[Category: Geology]]\n[[Category: Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category: Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category: Comics featuring Ponytail]]"
