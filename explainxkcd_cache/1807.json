    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1807\n| date      = March 6, 2017\n| title     = Listening\n| image     = listening.png\n| titletext = Sure, you could just ask, but this also takes care of the host gift thing.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nThis comic depicts [[Cueball]] and [[Ponytail]] welcoming [[Black Hat]] and [[Danish]] to their house. Black Hat immediately talks to {{w|Amazon Alexa}} to order two tons of {{w|creamed corn}}. This would be quite expensive (around $10,000), and the hosts would be charged because it was ordered on their {{w|Amazon Echo}} device. It would also be a serious inconvenience. The purchase would be quite bulky and useless, not even likely to arrive until ''after'' the visitor has departed, with an average homeowner having very little use for two tons of creamed corn.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe caption claims that this is an effort to find systems recording conversations, such as Alexa or {{w|Google Home}}, for the security of the ''guests'', so they aren't being monitored by an always-on listening device without their consent (at least not without any consequences). However, because Black Hat is the one coming up with this, it's more likely his motives are on the sadistic side, and it's more likely a warning for the hosts to turn off any voice-activated systems before having guests come over so that the guests don't take advantage of them. (It should also be noted that such purchasing services encourage the user to set up a PIN code to fend off such exploits.)\n\nA concerned \"visitor\" may also want to test for voice-activated systems when near any persons carrying an iPhone or Android mobile device, because these are also always-on listening devices. \"Hey Siri\" and \"Ok Google\" voice activation use the same technology as \"Alexa\" and \"Echo\" detection.\n\nThe title text says that this takes care of the \"host gift thing\", referring to the custom where house guests give a gift to the hosts. However, Black Hat is making the hosts pay for it, so it can be as expensive as he wants, thus making this yet another example of his being a [[classhole]]. For more examples of this, see the [[#Trivia|trivia]] below.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Danish enter Cueball and Ponytail's house. They have hardly passed the door mat, with the door still open showing the road and another house outside.]\n:Ponytail: Hello, welcome to our house!\n:Black Hat: Thanks for inviting us!\n:Black Hat: Alexa, order two tons of creamed corn.\n:Black Hat: Alexa, confirm purchase.\n\n:[Caption below the frame:]\n:When visiting a new house, it's good to check whether they have an always-on device transmitting your conversations somewhere.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In a previous comic, [[1559: Driving]], Black Hat took also took advantage of a cutting-edge AI&mdash;there, a self-driving car&mdash;by making it drive across the country without its owner or any passenger. And already back in [[596: Latitude]] he took advantage (of course) of people who constantly kept programs running on their phones that could track their movements.\n*Another comic about testing if someone is listening is [[525: I Know You're Listening]]. Just as Black Hat may just speak without knowing for sure that there is an active Alexa, Cueball in the old comic also just speaks out in case there is someone listening. In that case, it was addressed to real surveillance, but as can be seen in the entries below, Alexa may just end up being used like that later.\n*Usually Cueball is paired with [[Megan]], but since Black Hat's girlfriend Danish looks like Megan but with longer hair, this makes it sensible to choose Ponytail as Cueball's partner here. They were also partnered in the next comic [[1808: Hacking]].\n*Assuming a standard can of 14.75 oz (418 g) and Black Hat's order was in short tons the order would consist of 4339 cans. Consuming one per day it would last for approx. twelve years. But it's doubtful that the expiration date would be that long.\n*In a recent [http://www.npr.org/2016/12/31/507670072/amazon-echo-murder-case-renews-privacy-questions-prompted-by-our-digital-footprints court case] authorities believed that an Amazon Echo may have recorded the identity of a murder suspect, leading to a debate about the privacy and safety implications of such devices.\n*Another recent [http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/7/14200210/amazon-alexa-tech-news-anchor-order-dollhouse event] resulted in Alexa ordering several people unwanted doll houses.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Ponytail]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Danish]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Virtual Assistants]]"
