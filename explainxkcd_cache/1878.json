The other comics are [[1876: Eclipse Searches]], [[1877: Eclipse Science]], [[1879: Eclipse Birds]], and [[1880: Eclipse Review]].\n\nThe comic claims that the reason that eclipses don't happen every month is simple to understand by looking at an orbital diagram. Ironically, the cartoon has so many parts and labels that it is far more difficult to understand than is implied. While the graph itself is based on {{w|Orbital elements|astronomical definitions}}, all the labels are nonsense in this context. In effect, the comic is a new take on a common joke in which a person asks a scientist a question, the scientist begins by saying \"It's really quite simple\", then proceeds to give a very lengthy and highly technical explanation that non-scientists would not be expected to understand. Diagrams for eclipses commonly include things that laypeople may not find relevant, without explanation, such as the umbra and penumbra.\n\nAll of the labels in the diagram are complicated words or phrases. Some are related to orbital mechanics (e.g. \"equinox\" and \"perihelion\"), while others are wholly unrelated or even made up.  Each label is nonsensical in its place in the diagram.  Compare/contrast with the standard {{w|Kepler orbit|Kepler Orbit}} diagram.\n\nThe title text references warnings to not look directly into the sun, but parodies those warnings by referring to 'orbit', the anatomical term for the eye socket.\n\n===Labels and Their Astronomical Meanings===\nAll items are not drawn to scale. Neither the sizes of the celestial objects are that similar as shown nor the orbits are. The real scales are shown in this table:\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right;\"\n! \n! real (in km)\n! to scale\n\n|-\n| Sun (radius)\n| 695,700\n| basketball\n\n|-\n| distance Earth-Sun\n| 149,600,000\n| length of a large truck (26 meters)\n|-\n| Earth (radius)\n| 6,371\n| pinhead (1 mm)\n|-\n| Moon (radius)\n| 1,737\n| pin (0.3 mm)\n|-\n| distance Earth-Moon\n| 384,399\n| small necklace (6.6 cm)\n\n|}\nWhen the distance Sun-Earth is scaled to one meter or below neither Moon nor Earth can be seen by the human eye.\n\n;Arctangent\n*{{w|Arctangent}} is the inverse function of the tangent function of trigonometry. You can determine a non-right angle of a right triangle by taking the arctangent of the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side.\n*The angle shown in the comic has no astronomical meaning.\n\n;Astral plane\n*The {{w|Astral plane}} is a plane of existence in various esoteric theories. It features prominently in {{w|Dungeons & Dragons}} cosmology, connecting the various other planes of existence.\n*The picture shows the {{w|Orbit_of_the_Moon|lunar orbital plane}}, the plane in which the Moon orbits the Earth, tilted about 5.1 degrees from the ecliptic.\n\n;Declension\n*{{w|Declension}} is the inflection of nouns in a language. In {{w|Latin}} declension and declination are both called ''{{w|la:Declinatio|Declinatio}}''. In this comic, however, it might be a portmanteau of declination and (right) ascension.\n*In astronomy, the {{w|Declination|declination}} is one of the two angles that locate a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system. It is measured north or south of the celestial equator, like the geographical latitude on Earth. But in the picture the label is at the angle for the axial tilt of the Earth.\n*And the {{w|Right_ascension|right ascension}} is the angular distance measured eastward along the celestial equator from the vernal equinox to the hour circle of the point in question.\n\n;Determinant of the date of Easter\n*In Western Christianity {{w|Easter}} always falls on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon after the beginning of spring (equinox). The ecclesiastical full moon is determined by a calendar that approximates the actual time of the full moon, Thus the date of easter is defined by a combination of a solar and a lunar calendar. The position of that angle isn't that bad but it should be not more than 30 degrees (slightly more than one lunar month.)\n*In mathematics, the determinant is a function of numerical matrices.  In this context, however, it apparently refers to something that directly determines the date of Easter.\n\n;Dimples of Venus\n*The {{w|Dimples of Venus}} are indentations sometimes visible on the human lower back.\n*In astronomy the {{w|Belt of Venus}} is a shadow cast by the Earth visible in its atmosphere.\n\n;Enceliopsis\n*''{{w|Enceliopsis}}'' is a small genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, appropriately known as \"sunrays\".\n*The element \"encel-\" might also be a reference to {{w|Enceladus}}, a moon around {{w|Saturn}}.\n*The elements \"-elio-\" and \"-psis\" are also found in many technical orbital terms such as aphelion, perihelion, apsis, apoapsis and periapsis. See {{w|apsis}}.\n*The point depicted on the diagram has no specific meaning. \n\n;Equinox / Solstice\n{{w|Equinox}} and {{w|Solstice}} have very different meanings:\n*An Equinox is one of two instants in the year when the sun is exactly over the equator; the length of day and night are very nearly equal that day at all locations on the planet, and it is potentially the first day of Spring or Autumn, depending on the time of year, in which hemisphere (Northern vs Southern) the observer is located, and which definition of seasons one uses.\n*A Solstice is one of two instants in the year when the sun's angle is maximally far from Earth's equator; when one occurs, the length of the day or night is shortest or longest (depending on whether one is in the northern or southern hemisphere), and (in the United States) it marks the first day of summer or winter.\n\nBoth types occur because the Earth's rotation axis is tilted (at 23.4 degrees) from its orbital plane (ecliptic) about the Sun.\n\nJokingly insisting that two different terms are American/British variants of the same word has been the topic of [[1677: Contrails]].\n\n;Hypothecate\n*{{w|Hypothecate}} is a legal verb that means something similar to \"make a mortgage\".\n*The {{w|hypotenuse}} is the longest side of a right-angled triangle. Here it is an unrelated length, approximately equal to the diameter of the sun (half the angular size of the sun times twice the distance to it).\n\n;Obsequity\n*Obsequity means the state of being obsequious (showing an indecorous willingness to obey or serve, or \"sucking up\").\n*In astronomy the correct word is {{w|Obliquity}}, meaning an axial tilt.\n\n;Perihelix\n*This is a portmanteau of helix and perihelion.\n*The {{w|perihelion}} is the point in a elliptical solar orbit that is closest to the Sun.\n\n;Prolapse\n*A {{w|Prolapse}} is a medical condition in which an internal organ is slipped forward or down.\n*The word might be a reference to the {{w|Apsis| apoapsis}}, which is the point of a body's elliptical orbit about the system's centre of mass where the distance between the body and the centre of mass is at its maximum. The periapsis is the point where the distance between the body and the centre of mass is at its minimum. In the specific case of the Moon’s orbit, these points are called apogee and perigee. On the diagram, the prolapse is not shown as a point, but as an angle of the Moon’s orbit.\n*{{w|Retrograde and prograde motion}} are terms used to describe the apparent motion of celestial objects through the sky. \n\n;Sagittal plane\n*The {{w|Sagittal plane}} is an anatomical plane, dividing the body in left and right.\n*The correct label in the picture would be the {{w|Ecliptic plane}}. The plane the Earth orbits the Sun.\n*{{w|Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius}} is one of the stellar constellations of the Zodiac. The center of the Milky Way lies in this constellation.\n\n;Solar plexus\n*The {{w|Solar plexus}} is a network of nerves located in the abdomen. It was the name of [[64: Solar Plexus]].\n*{{w|Solar}} is an adjective referring to the Sun, the star in our solar system.\n\n;Tropopause\n*The {{w|Tropopause}} is the boundary in our atmosphere between the troposphere and stratosphere, defined as the boundary where air ceases to cool with increasing elevation. It is 9-17 km above sea level, not the thousands of kilometers as depicted here.\n*The label appears to point at the orbit of the moon.\n\n;Angle between the Astral and the Sagittal Planes\n* The angle depicted is the inclination of the moon orbit. The planes are marked with nonexistent symbols, derived from Greek letters. The lunar orbit plane is labeled by a mixture of a ''nu'' (ν) and a ''gamma'' (γ), the ecliptic is labeled with a double ''chi'' (χ), and the angle between is marked with a ''phi'' (ϕ) but having two vertical lines.\n\n;Errata\n* Errata are corrections in a published text (e.g. a newspaper article) issued after the publication.\n* The word might be a reference the words {{w|Aberration of light| aberration}}, {{w|Orbital eccentricity| eccentricity}} or {{w|True anomaly| anomaly}}, which all have both a technical astronomical definition and a common definition meaning \"something wrong or strange\". Of the three, the term \"aberration\" is the closest looking to \"errata\", but, unlike eccentricity and anomaly, it is not the name of an orbital parameter.\n* The angle depicted lies between the direction from Earth to the Sun in the ecliptic and the line where the lunar orbit plane crosses the ecliptic. When this angle would be zero AND the Moon is between the Sun and Earth a total eclipse would occur. This is they only part of the diagram fulfilling slightly Randall's promise on top of the picture.\n\n==Explanation for \"Why isn't there a (solar) eclipse every month?\"==\n\nIf the plane of where the Earth orbits the Sun and where the Moon orbits the Earth were completely aligned, then there would be a solar eclipse at every new moon (once every {{w|Orbit_of_the_Moon#Lunar_periods| 29.5 days}}) and a lunar eclipse at every full moon (half a lunar period about 14.7 days after a New Moon).  However, the plane in which the Moon orbits the Earth is tilted with an inclination of 5 degrees relative to that of the ecliptic plane (the plane defined by the Earth's orbit around the Sun).  Eclipses are only possible during two eclipse seasons each year (half a year apart) where for a period of 31 to 37 days the Sun is nearly aligned with the two points in the tilted Earth-Moon plane where the Moon crosses the ecliptic plane.  During an eclipse season at the time of a new moon there will be solar eclipses visible from certain locations and during full moons there will be lunar eclipses.\n\n[[Image:Eclipse_Diagram.jpg]]\n\nThe real explanation of eclipses is evident from this xkcd comic, but is labeled with a fictional character similar to a Greek phi but with two vertical lines; the remaining labels also do not contribute to this explanation and exist only to distract or misinform or entertain the reader. Thus, there is some truth behind the statement, \"The answer is made clear by a quick look,\" assuming a quick look means only a glance at the diagram/drawing without taking the time to read the labels.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[An orbital map of the Earth is shown.
