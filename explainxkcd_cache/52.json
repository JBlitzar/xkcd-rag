The previous one was [[51: Malaria]], and the next one was [[53: Hobby]]. It was among the [[:Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com|last eleven comics]] posted both on LiveJournal and on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] after the new site was launched. This comic wasn't published on the same day across both sites, but most of them shared the same posting day. It was released on LiveJournal on January 23, 2006, two days after originally being posted on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com]. See the [[#Trivia|triva section]] below.\n\n==Explanation==\nThe quote written in the large white bubbles comes from {{w|The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman}}, a comic book series about dreams. {{w|Neil Gaiman}} is a science fiction and fantasy author who came to fame for writing The Sandman. The interconnected bubbles represent the secret worlds of different people and how they are connected. They may have the second meaning of the neurons in our brain.\n\nThe title text suggests that Randall used the {{w|Four color theorem}}, which states that a {{w|graph theory|graph}} drawn on a flat plane (like this one) requires at most four colors so that each region differs from all of its neighbors. Whilst the comic uses four colors (red, yellow, green, blue), this clearly does not include the white bubbles with text. Nor can the white bubbles be replaced with a different colour: each white bubble is connected to all four other colours.\n\nHere is the original quote:\n\n{{Quote|Everybody has a secret world inside of them... All of the people in the whole world, I mean everybody â€” no matter how dull and boring they are on the outside. Inside them they've all got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds... Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe.|[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/413047-everybody-has-a-secret-world-inside-of-them-i-mean- Neil Gaiman]}}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A multitude of circles connected with several lines. Most of them are rather small and colored red, yellow, green and blue. Nine of them are white, six of these are larger than all the other circles, but one is the same size as the largest colored (green) circle, and the two smallest are smaller than a few of the colored circles. Pieces of text are written in all the white circles. Although it can be confusing at first, the reading order is still the normal one: left to right and top to bottom. Reading the circles in that order gives the following text:]\n:\"Everybody has a secret world inside of them.\n:All of the people in the whole world\n:I mean everybody\n:No matter how dull and boring they are on the outside\n:Inside they've all got unimaginable\n:magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing, worlds\n:Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe.\"\n:--Neil Gaiman\n:Sandman\n\n==Trivia==\n* For unknown reasons, on January 18, 2006, [[54: Science]] was posted on LiveJournal on the same day that [[51: Malaria]] was released on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com]. Three days later, on January 21, 2006, [[51: Malaria]] was posted on LiveJournal, thus forcing the next two comics (this one and [[53: Hobby]]) to be released on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com] two days before LiveJournal. Four days later, on January 25, 2006, [[54: Science]] was finally posted on [https://xkcd.com xkcd.com], which fixed the date discrepancies and allowed the next comic, [[55: Useless]], to be published on the same day across both sites.\n* This comic was [[:Category:Saturday comics|released on a Saturday]].\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal| 50]]\n[[Category:Posted on LiveJournal after xkcd.com]]\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]"
