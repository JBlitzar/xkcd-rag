    "explanation": "{{comic\n| number    = 1148\n| date      = December 17, 2012\n| title     = Nothing to Offer\n| image     = nothing to offer.png\n| titletext = cerebrospinal fluid, pericardial fluid, sputum, aqueous humor, perilymph, chyme, hydatid fluid, interstitial fluid, rheum, and gin.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\n\"I have nothing to offer but {{w|blood, toil, tears, and sweat}}\" is a famous phrase in a speech given by {{w|Winston Churchill}}, which would be heard on the radio in the 1940s. The comic then goes on to list numerous other increasingly obscure {{w|body fluid|bodily fluids}}, including through the title text, ending humorously with {{w|gin}} (which Churchill was partial to).\n\nThe fluids in order: {{w|blood}}, {{w|tears}}, {{w|sweat}}, {{w|saliva|spit}}, {{w|bile}}, {{w|vomit}}, {{w|urine}}, {{w|mucus}}, {{w|semen}}, {{w|earwax}}, {{w|lymph}}, {{w|gastric acid}}, {{w|sebum}}, {{w|pus}}, {{w|endolymph}}, {{w|intracellular fluid}}, {{w|blood plasma}}, {{w|vitreous humor}}, {{w|feces}}, {{w|pleural cavity fluid}}, {{w|chyle}}, {{w|synovial fluid}}, {{w|peritoneal fluid}}, {{w|cerebrospinal fluid}}, {{w|pericardial fluid}}, {{w|sputum}}, {{w|aqueous humor}}, {{w|perilymph}}, {{w|chyme}}, {{w|hydatid fluid}}, {{w|interstitial fluid}}, {{w|rheum}}, and {{w|gin}}. The partially obscured ones near the end are taken by process of elimination. CHLY- seems to be a typo for CHYL(E).\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Radio on a dresser.]\n:Radio: I have nothing to offer\n:Radio: But\n\n:Radio: Blood, toil, tears, sweat,\n\n:Radio: spit, bile, vomit, urine,\n\n:[Text is now bleeding through the background and gets obscured then cut off.]\n:Radio: mucus, semen, earwax, lymph, gastric acid, sebum, pus, endolymph, intracellular fluid, blood plasma, vitreous humor, feces, pleural cavity fluid, chlye, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid,\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Biology]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring politicians]]"
