[[Black Hat]] (who could potentially be [[White Hat]], but this is more Black Hat behavior) attempts to distract [[Cueball]] with this event so that he may knock out Cueball with the bottle in his hand and steal his new car, a {{w|Tesla Roadster (first generation)|Tesla Roadster}}. If the bottle is green, it would also be the cause of the green flash.\n\nThe title text simply continues this, wherein Black Hat (White Hat?) jokes that green flashes are actually caused, at least in part, by the fact that Cueball has a cool car worth stealing.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Black Hat and Cueball are standing on the beach, watching the sun set. Black Hat is holding something in his left hand.]\n:Black Hat: Did you know that if you stare at the sun just as it sets, you can see a green flash? \n:Black Hat: <small>And feel a sharp blow to the head, and hear the faint hum of me driving away in your new Tesla Roadster?</small>\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with color]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Black Hat]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]"
