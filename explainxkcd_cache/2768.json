It is typically demonstrated in terms of compound interest. Here, Miss Lenhart seems to be setting up such an example, but in a typical Lenhart style she is actually asking her student to give her money.\n\nThe constant ''e'' can be described {{w|E (mathematical constant)#Compound interest|in the context of compound interest}}. For a bank account that pays interest at a rate of 100% per year, and that interest is paid ''n'' times a year and compounded, then a $1 deposit will grow to $1 * (1 + 100%''/n'')^''n'' after a year. As ''n'' approaches infinity (continuous compounding), the amount approaches ''e'' dollars. In the comic, minutely compounding is used as an approximation of continuous compounding; here ''n'' = 365 * 24 * 60 = 525,600 (527,040 for leap years with 366 days), and the resulting amount would be $2.7182792…, less than one part per million different from that of a straight multiplication by ''e'' (which is 2.7182818…).\n\nAs such, one would expect Miss Lenhart to say in the last panel something like \"you'll have ''e'' dollars in a year\". The joke here is that she instead uses the normal beginning phrase (\"If you have $1...\") and turns it into a charge to answer the question (\"I will answer your question.\")\n\nIn the title text, Randall remembers that his high school teacher, like Miss Lenhart in the comic, had a bank account that paid 100% annual interest. This is an extremely high rate, and a bank that is able to offer it must have a very lucrative source of revenue. Therefore, he bought the bank, via a {{w|Takeover#Hostile|hostile takeover}}, in order to gain direct access to that source, and now uses it as a source of supplementary income. It is unlikely that this story is true.{{cn}}\n\nIt is also plausible that the title text is Miss Lenhart explaining how she acquired the bank to set up her account there, and that she regularly charges people $1 for trivial services, such as explaining concepts to her students.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Hairy is seated behind a classroom desk with his hand raised asking the teacher Miss Lenhart a question. She is standing in front of him with a board behind her. Beneath the board there are ledge with writing tools on it (markers or chalk).]\n:Hairy: Can you explain what the constant ''e'' actually ''means?''\n:Miss Lenhart: Sure.\n\n:[Zoom in on Miss Lenhart's upper half, as she raises one hand palm up.]\n:Miss Lenhart: I have a bank account that pays 100% annual interest, compounded every minute.\n\n:[In a frame-less, and very slim panel, Miss Lenhart is shown holding a hand up with one finger raised.]\n:Miss Lenhart: If you deposit $1 now,\n\n:[Miss Lenhart now has both arms down as she continues to address the off-panel Hairy.]\n:Miss Lenhart: I will answer your question.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics with lowercase text]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Hairy]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Miss Lenhart]]\n[[Category:Math]]"
