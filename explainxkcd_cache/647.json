The boy is unimpressed, so Rob challenges him to come up with a scarier story. Rob's nephew merely states that he was born after {{w|9/11}}, and yet he is already mentally developed enough to hold a conversation with an adult. This proves effective, as in the final panel Rob assumes a fetal position, gripped by existential dread.\n\nThere is no hidden meaning here, but this comic sure is scary for many adults. What's being implied here is that time seems to be moving really quickly and we're getting older faster than we think. Events that seem like they \"just happened\" have happened long enough ago for a whole other person to come into existence, grow up, and learn to carry on a conversation. Every time we get reminded of this fact, it can be scary, as you then realize that [[1393: Timeghost|you are now closer to your death]]...\n\n9/11 was a terrorist attack in the United States in 2001, on September 11th. Major events such as the assassination of {{w|Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy}}, the Moon Landing of {{w|Apollo 11}} or 9/11 are easily memorable. It is often said that \"everyone remembers where they were when they first heard...\". In consequence, these events act as milestones in our memory. They are recalled more vividly, and seem more recent. Today this is maybe also topping the {{w|Attack on Pearl Harbor}} which happened in 1941.\n\nThe title text mentions that [[Randall]] is teaching his 8-year-old relatives to say the same as in the comic — presumably to the annoyance of his older relatives who will be reminded of the fast passage of time. He does not stop here, but teaches the 14-year-olds to say they are born after {{w|Toy Story}} — a major block buster hit from {{w|Pixar}} which came out in 1995. A movie many people will remember fondly and feel just came out the other day. He continues with these scary thoughts by mentioning that {{w|Pokémon}} (1996) came out over a decade ago and that kids born after the big {{w|Disney}} hit movie {{w|Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin}} from 1992 will turn 18 next year (i.e. in 2010 a year after this comic was published).\n\n[[Randall]] has both before and after this comic tried to [[:Category:Comics to make one feel old|make people feel old]] several times.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Rob and his nephew (also drawn like a Cueball, but smaller) are sitting on the ground facing each other. Rob is holding a flash-light up to his face and leans back on the other arm, while crossing his legs. The nephew is sitting forward resting one arm on his lifted knees and leaning back on his other arm.]\n:Rob: But they ''never found the ghost's head!''\n:Nephew: Lame story, Uncle Rob.\n:Rob: And you could do scarier?\n:Nephew: Sure.\n\n:[Rob has removed the flash-light from his face and the nephew leans more back and has shifted a leg down so only one knee supports the arm which are now more straight.]\n:Rob: Try me.\n:Nephew: 9/11 happened before I was born, yet I'm old enough to have this conversation with you.\n\n:[Rob has dropped the flash-light. The nephew has taken the other arm down to the ground. Beat panel.]\n\n:[Rob has curled his legs up to his chin and wrapped his arms around them while the nephew relaxes even more.]\n\n==Trivia==\n*Since 2017-11-05, the time between 9/11 and this comic has been smaller than the time between this comic and the present.\n*Since 2019-09-11, some babies born after 9/11 are old enough to vote\n*Since 2022-09-11, some people born after 9/11 are old enough to buy alcohol in the US\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Rob]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]] <!--the little guy-->\n[[Category:Multiple Cueballs]] <!--two of the stick figures-->\n[[Category:Comics to make one feel old]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Disney]]"
