Evolutionary excuses in this context are trying to lay blame somewhere other than either participant, and so can be seen as comforting, but of course they falsely place all women in an inferior position to all men, at least when it comes to \"abstract math\". She naturally objects to the excuse,  calls it bullshit sexism, and, depending on how you interpret it, may indicate this isn't the first time she's heard him say something similar.\n\nBut the twist is that he turns out not to be talking about her lower-case savanna (which may also be spelled with \"h\" like the city) ancestors, the ones in the African savanna of millenia ago, but rather of her very recent \"Savannah ancestors\", better called parents, who live in the city of Savannah. They apparently know each other well. The implication is now much more personal: that her mother didn't prepare her. Of course, Randall uses only upper case everywhere, so he has avoided giving the reader a clue about the misdirect-joke he is working toward.\n\nTeasing people about their mothers in the USA — specifically that their mothers' are particularly stupid, fat or promiscuous — is a common enough theme in popular culture that there is a series of jokes that start with the words \"Yo mama\" that exemplify the genre. There is also an extremely common theme that the South's education system is failing; the comic combines the two.\n\nThe title text is apparently Megan starting to defend her mother, but then lapsing into a Yo Mama joke without the introducing words, showing that her mother is stupid enough to think that a quarterback (one of the positions played in American football) would be a river in Egypt. This is a conflation of the Yo Mama joke \"Yo mama so stupid she thinks a quarterback is a refund!\" and the common pun, \"Denial (sounds like \"The Nile\") is not just a river in Egypt\".\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball and Megan are at a blackboard with equations and graphs on it.]\n:Cueball: Look, I'm doing my best, but the fact is your savannah ancestors just didn't prepare you for doing abstract math.\n:Megan: See, that's just the kind of bullshit sexism that discredits evo-psych. Your \"evolutionary histories\" always seem tuned to produce 1950's gender roles.\n:Cueball: Evolutionary? What? I meant Savannah, ''Georgia.''\n:Megan: ...Hey! Let's leave my mom out of this.\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Math]]\n[[Category:Your Mom]]\n[[Category:Puns]]"
