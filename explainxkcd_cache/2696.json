Accuracy concerns whether a statement is true, while precision concerns how detailed it is; it is possible for a statement to be one but not the other. The comic explores this concept by comparing {{w|Barack Obama}}, former President of the United States, with {{w|cat}}s. Confusingly, he measures different statistics of both Barack Obama and cats (sometimes measuring them in terms of cats) leaving the unwary reader even more confused.\n\nBeing precise is typical of calculations that roll out an excess of significant digits, often in the form of trailing decimals. Precision is lowered by using more rounded figures, or merely being comparative, but largely unaffected by whether the original values used were accurate or even correct. Accuracy is a cumulative function of the accuracy given to the intermediate values used for any calculation, and can be degraded by using figures that are themselves in some way inaccurate or imprecise. One part of confusion between the two is because being too precise usually decreases accuracy.\n\nThe numbers mentioned in the top row (high precision) of the table all use exactly the same digits, dictating that a full five digits of ''precision'' are used in them all. The most \"valid\" or correct value is a number that's very accurate and precise (see table). For the medium accuracy the number is an anagram of the 1st entry, giving a value that is reasonable but would be overly exact, whilst the low accuracy number is just a repeat of the first entry's digits with a shifted decimal but clearly at the wrong scale, as Randall could have shifted the decimal point one further place to the left to be closest to the true measurement. Instead, he replaces the thousands separator with the decimal point, perhaps for the visual pun.\n\nThe title text compares Obama's and cats' enjoyment of playing with cardboard boxes. While cats are known to do this,{{citation needed}} we don't know whether Obama does.\n\nThe day prior to the publication of this comic (November 8, 2022) was election day in the United States, so Randall may have been remembering Barack Obama's presidency at this time.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Precision\n!Accuracy\n!Statement\n!Explanation\n|-\n|High\n|High\n|Barack Obama was president for 70,128 hours\n|This is the official length in hours of {{w|Barack Obama}}'s 8-year presidency, including 2 {{w|leap year|leap days}}. Obama served from January 20, 2009 through January 20, 2017, and his term officially began and ended at noon on those days. (There were three {{w|leap second|leap seconds}} during his presidency, though.)\n|-\n|High\n|Medium\n|Barack Obama weighs as much as 17.082 cats\n|The accuracy would depend on the mass of the cats in question.  Also a human's mass can vary by a few pounds in a small amount of time as meals are consumed, resources are used in metabolism and wastes are eliminated, and thus this may be overly precise due the margin of error in both the mass of cats and the mass of Mr. Obama. In 2016, Obama was [https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/obama-medical-exam-loses-weight officially reported] to weigh 175 lb (79.3787 kg). [https://www.google.com/search?q=how+heavy+is+an+average+cat Google claims that an average cat weighs between 8.8 and 11 lbs], so this statement could be considered accurate. If you use the midpoint of that weight range (9.9 lbs) and divide it by Mr. Obama's reported weight, the \"number of cats\" he weighs comes in at a very close answer (rounded) of 17.07 cats.\n|-\n|High\n|Low\n|Barack Obama is 70.128 feet tall\n|A highly precise (5 significant digits) measurement, but far from his actual height, published as 6'1\".\nThe given value is more than an order of magnitude different from both him and {{w|Robert Wadlow|almost}} any other known human, whilst one of 7.0128 would ''only'' be about 15% off â€“ still a low accuracy, but not outside the realms of possibility for an otherwise unknown person.\nCoincidentally, Barack Obama is approximately 70 ''cat'' feet tall, using the paw size of a house cat to measure his height. Given the number of cat-related facts in the rest of the chart, this could be seen as rather appropriate.\n|-\n|Medium\n|High\n|Most cats have 4 legs\n|Like many mammals, cats are quadrupeds, which means \"four feet\".  Unless there is a genetic or other developmental issue, or an an injury that causes the loss of a limb, then cats generally have 4 legs.\n|-\n|Medium\n|Medium\n|Barack Obama is 6'1\"\n|While only as precise as the nearest inch, a common degree of rounding in that scale of measurement, that is the former president's published height.\n[https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/obama-medical-exam-loses-weight In 2016], Obama was said to have \"grown\" 0.5 inches in height, so there is a definite lack of consistency of exactly how tall he is. The examinations may have been made at different times of their respective days, with some spinal compression occurring all the time not laid in bed, and his current height is also not publicly recorded; several years of gradual aging could also reduce his posture slightly, or sustaining his fitness (since experiencing the travails of office) may counteract this to a greater or lesser effect.\n|-\n|Medium\n|Low\n|Barack Obama has 4 legs\n|Barack Obama, being a mammal, does qualify as a {{w|tetrapod}}, but as a primate, his ancestors' forelimbs evolved into arms and hands. Like other humans, he does not generally use them for locomotion,{{citation needed}} but to manipulate his environment. Thus calling these limbs \"legs\" runs counter to normal definitions, and is inaccurate.\n\n|-\n|Low\n|High\n|Most cats have legs\n|A true (high accuracy) statement without much information (low precision).\n|-\n|Low\n|Medium\n|Barack Obama has fewer legs than your cat\n|Again, this will depend on the cat (not to mention whether or not you actually have a cat), but in general, true.\n|-\n|Low\n|Low\n|Barack Obama's cat has hundreds of legs\n|This statement has low accuracy, as Barack Obama owns a four-legged dog named Sunny, but is not known to have owned a cat, much less one with more legs than normal. And cats tend not to have hundreds of legs.{{Citation needed}} It also has low precision, as \"hundreds\" could reasonably range from 200 to 900. (From a strict logician's point of view, this could however be considered a vacuously true statement.)\n|-\n|Low\n|Unsure\n|Barack Obama is much less likely than the average cat to jump in and out of cardboard boxes for fun\n|Barack Obama has never publicly jumped in and out of cardboard boxes for fun,{{Citation needed}} but the possibility exists that he does so in private. Cats, on the other hand, [https://www.purina.co.uk/articles/cats/behaviour/common-questions/why-do-cats-like-boxes#:~:text=Cats%20get%20comfort%20and%20security,from%20the%20side%20or%20behind are commonly known for jumping in and out of cardboard boxes for fun.]\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[The comic shows a table with 3 rows and 3 columns.
