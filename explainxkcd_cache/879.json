Traditionally, genies grant three wishes to whoever rubs their lamp, thus freeing them. Cueball rubs the lamp, but instead of releasing a genie, the lamp appears to ejaculate. Cueball is grossed out by this and holds the lamp away from him.\n\nThe imagery and style of the comic are intentionally similar to male stimulation and ejaculation. The act of rubbing one's genitals to stimulate orgasm is well known and well documented in both literature and science.{{Citation needed}} However, almost anyone would be disturbed by unintentionally giving sexual pleasure to a stranger.\n\nIn the title text, a discussion is shown between Cueball and the lamp. Cueball states that what happened was NOT one of the three wishes he would have asked for if a genie had been released, and the lamp retorts, \"Who said anything about YOUR wishes?\", implying that the lamp's wish was to receive \"handy\" stimulation (or possibly that the [[Black Hat|last user of the lamp]] wished for that to happen to the next owner).\n\nGenies are also mentioned in at least five other comics:\n*[[152: Hamster Ball]]\n*[[532: Piano]] (where the joke is also penis related)\n*[[1391: Darkness]]\n*[[2193: Well-Ordering Principle]]\n*[[2741: Wish Interpretation]]\n\nIn the song {{w|Genie in a Bottle}}, from 1999 by {{w|Christina Aguilera}}, the sexual comparison of rubbing a genie in  bottle is very clear in the song, although here it is a woman genie that needs to be [https://youtu.be/kIDWgqDBNXA?t=52 rubbed in the right way] to be let out.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Cueball stumbles on a lamp, lying on the ground.]\n\n:[Cueball picks it up.]\n:''Rub rub''\n\n:[The lamp sprays fluids.]\n:''Splort''\n\n:[Cueball holds the lamp at arm's length, a puddle of fluid on the ground.]\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Penis]]\n[[Category:Genie]]"
