At this stage of theory development, it is less about breaking down the complex nature of relativity and more about how fun it would be to go really fast. So his thought experiment is currently just, so to speak, a flight of fantasy. (Although even Einstein's \"NYYOOOM\" sound of a car whizzing by is the sound of the {{w|Doppler effect}}, which alludes strongly to the {{w|relativistic Doppler effect}} and [[2853: Redshift|redshift]].) Since this is early in his life, he is most likely sitting in the {{w|Albert_Einstein#1902–1909:_Assistant_at_the_Swiss_Patent_Office|Swiss patent office}} he is so famous for working at, when he got his groundbreaking ideas.\n\nIn a similar vein, the title text refers to one of the long-standing issues about Mercury: {{w|Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury|its orbit around the Sun}} doesn't ''quite'' match what {{w|Newtonian physics}} would predict. We now know that this is accounted for by {{w|general relativity}}, another of Einstein's notable theories (which relates how gravity, or the space-time curvature that we understand as gravity, influences time and space, including planetary orbits) that was further developed out from the framework of special relativity. Again, we find ourselves overhearing his thoughts before he reaches any insights that will start to explain this. Instead he is stuck at just 'imagining' that Mercury is hot due to its proximity to the Sun, which isn't a particularly novel or useful conclusion, or close to what we would now recognize as Einstein's much-lauded theory.\n\nAt around the time of the comic's scenario, being only the first stages of Einstein's thoughts about Relativity, the issue of the Sun's heat was still considered a mystery. The {{w|Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism}} was proposed as the cause of the Sun's heat but was later superseded by the more modern understanding of nuclear fusion. The {{w|Yarkovsky effect}} had also been previously described as how thermal effects may influence orbital dynamics; this is still useful to know about in the case of asteroids but is not considered a significant factor for Mercury. Neither of these things were ever the focus of Einstein's own studies, though in 1915 he showed that General Relativity could explain Mercury's orbital anomalies, and independent observations during a 1919 solar eclipse helped confirm the principles and make Einstein famous.\n\nAn older version of Einstein was previously drawn in [[1206: Einstein]] and [[1233: Relativity]].\n\nAlso, a comic with a similar punchline to this one is [[2689: Fermat's First Theorem]], which has Pierre de Fermat instead of Einstein.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Albert Einstein (a relatively<!-- no pun intended, but apt! --> young version, drawn with dark curly hair and a dark moustache) sitting on a chair, with a thought bubble above his head.
