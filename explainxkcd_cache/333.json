('Bedtime' and 'us time' are not necessarily 'computer time'.)\n\nThis comic may also be a reference to how people can get addicted to reading Wikipedia pages, because there are many interesting links on each page that people haven't read yet, and there are links on that page that they click on, etc.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that many rely on Wikipedia instead of remembering/learning stuff. Reliance on Wikipedia was later directly addressed as the subject of [[903: Extended Mind]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[Megan and Cueball are in a bed at night, and Cueball reaches out from under the covers to do a Wikipedia search about Foreplay.]\n\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n[[Category:Romance]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring Megan]]\n[[Category:Comics with inverted brightness]]\n[[Category:Sex]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia]]"
