It starts with normal digits and commas you would find in a large number, but gradually becomes more and more chaotic. It turns out that this is not a number at all, but some sort of printing error in whatever Randall is reading.\n\nThe very start of the comic is a bit absurd. In most cases, you can tell that a number like this is very large because of how long it is when written out; you wouldn't have to completely reinterpret it at the end of ''every'' group of digits. However, to tell exactly which \"-illion\" the number falls into, you would have to count the groups, and the scale of such a large number would grow less familiar as you try to keep track of how large it even is. Certain sizes of numbers tend to show up in specific contexts, like {{w|astronomy}}. So, rather than literally showing Randall's developing thoughts on the evidently massive size of this number, the comic also shows how he tends to interpret numbers at each possible \"-illion\" scale. See detailed explanation of Randall's thoughts in the [[#Table of thoughts|table]] below, where the title text is also explained.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for seeing a number like this appear in a software application. The most likely is that the observer is looking not at a number, but a group of {{w|comma-separated values}} in their raw form, like when a csv-formatted file is opened in a basic text editor. The .csv format is a common way to export \"rows\" of a {{w|relational database}}. In this context the \"number\" would actually be a database row with 11 fields followed by a separate pair of values after the quotation mark.  Databases use schemas that define the structure and range of values that are stored the fields that make up the rows. Therefore a data field defined to have three digits would store null values with the appropriate number of zeroes. This would explain the mix of 3 and 4 digit groupings. Moreover, most database schemas do not require all fields to be non-empty, and databases with large amounts of null fields are common. In this case, one of the populated values (54 or 054) would be the {{w|primary key}} with all the other values left null. Often when new data objects are initialized with default or null data that is replaced later. For example, 054 could be the user number and 54 the display name that is defaulted to the user number.\n\nThe strange quotation mark can indicate that the observed \"number\" is being consumed by two different processes as non-standard characters are useful when parsing data. In this case the first 11 values define the database row, then the final two value after the quote perform some other function. The presence of the hexadecimal characters \"e\" and \"f\" could indicate this part of the number is a {{w|hash value}} or security label that was added after the system designers realized they needed to implement access control or data integrity and it was too late/difficult to change the original database schema. As a technology enthusiast, Randall would be familiar with configuration files that contain something similar to this format. \n\nOther computer programming related reasons for the observed number include an array out-of-bounds error where bad coding results in the computer reading unrelated data in memory as text, eventually printing it as output. There is also misuse of the {{w|printf}} function in the {{w|C programming language}}. If strings passed to printf do not contain a {{w|null byte}} to terminate the string, it will go further into memory, again into unrelated data. Or the programmer might have several printf statements back to back, forgetting that printf doesn't add newlines (like the println function in other programming languages), so all their debug information gets printed on the same line. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Number fragment !! Thought !! Explanation\n|-\n| 54 || 54! Great! I know that number. Solid start. || 54 is a number with some real-world familiarity for most people. It is small enough to appear on digital clocks, and has enough factors to be listed on standard multiplication tables as 6 &times; 9.\n\nRandall pretending to reckon with the start of such a large number is probably meant to draw attention to the meaninglessness of doing so. Unless the exact value is somehow important, most readers wouldn't find much of a meaningful difference between \"54 zillion\" or \"over 50 zillion\", or even \"zillions and zillions\". In practice, the brain {{w|Approximate number system|can only approximate}} numbers this large; the {{w|Just-noticeable difference|threshold needed to tell the difference}} between the amounts that they represent is too high. Randall expresses a similar sentiment once he gets to the trillions and quadrillions.\n|-\n| ,000 (thousand) || Oh, a comma and some zeros. Cool. Must be at least 54 thousand. || Underselling how long the number is with the \"at least a thousand\", but is a fair thought from the POV of not being able to know how long the number is.\n|-\n| ,000 (million) || A second comma! I wonder if we're talking population or money. || Excitement from how large the number must be. {{w|Population}}s (like the number of people in a region) and large sums of money are both often measured in millions.\n|-\n| ,000 (billion) || Yikes! If this is money, it's a lot of money. || Three commas means a number in the billions. That's a lot of money for one person to have. Big decisions by large corporations, such as {{w|megamerger}}s, are often measured in billions of dollars in costs.\n|-\n| ,000,000 (quadrillion) || Why am I reading this? Whatever this number is, I'm not going to be able to visualize it. || Five commas is a number in the quadrillions.  At this point the number is too big for human minds to comprehend.\n|-\n| ,000 (quintillion) || All right, either someone made a unit conversion error or this is one of those incomprehensible astronomy numbers. || Astronomy often deals with extremely large numbers due to the incredible scale of the universe.  For example, the distance to the Andromeda galaxy in kilometers could be numbered in quintillions.  Alternatively, the person calculating the number made a mistake. Regarding the unit conversion there has recently been a comic about such a thing in [[3065: Square Units]] and similar mistakes have been used in [[2585: Rounding]].\n|-\n| ,0000 (!?) || Oh no. Is this a misplaced comma or an extra zero? I guess we'll see if the next group has two zeros or three. If it's two, we can at least hope the digits are right. || Commas are placed every three digits in {{w|Decimal separator#Digit grouping|typical western usage}} (although not necessarily in various other {{w|Indian numbering system#Decimal formatting|cultures}}), so something is wrong.  However, it might simply be that someone misplaced the comma to the right, meaning that this group has four digits and the next one would likely have two (the next comma in the 'correct' place). If the next group is three, then either the commas are now ''all'' misplaced or possibly someone/something just doubled up a zero by accident. A mistake of any kind makes one think that the number may not actually be accurate but, if the former, at least it might just be a relatively unimportant transposition.\n|-\n| ,0000 || Oh no. || A second group of four zeroes means it's not a typo. Something is seriously wrong. Note that some countries like [https://www.aceninja.sg/insights/2025/01/01/understanding-chinese-cultural-nuances-numerals China] or [https://www.kanpai-japan.com/learn-japanese/how-to-count-in-japanese Japan] (where 4-digit groupings are common) or [https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/indian-place-value-chart/ India] (which uses a unique 2- and 3-digit mixed system) may use non 3-digit groupings, but have their own rules for number groupings.\n|-\n| ,054 || What is happening. || Big numbers are normally rounded, so it's very strange to see a non-zero value this far down in the place values.  Also, \"54\" matches the digits at the start of the number so it could indicate the number was copied incorrectly. The non-zero digits here imply that all of the digits so far, including the zeroes, are {{w|significant figures}}; the number is not only extremely large, but implausibly precise with at least 30 significant figures. By way of comparison, the diameter of the observable universe is about 4.4 × 10<sup>26</sup> m, and if that measurement had 30 significant figures, it would be precise to about half a millimeter.\n|-\n| ,000\"000 || Someone messed up real bad. || The arcsecond mark \" (more properly written as a {{w|double prime}} symbol, &Prime;) indicates that this number is an angle or a distance in inches. For an angle, even accounting for how small an arcsecond is (1/3600th of a degree), this angle would be a huge number of rotations. As for inches, it would represent a distance much larger than the observable universe, though it is uncommon to use customary units like inches in conjunction with large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, this could be \"to-the-11th-power\" (&hellip;000<sup>11</sup> 000&hellip;), which would make the already extremely large number extremely ridiculously big. (5.4 × 10<sup>33</sup>)<sup>11</sup> ≈ 1.14 × 10<sup>371</sup>, in the same territory as a googol, i.e. 10<sup>100</sup>.\n\nThis could also be a sign of bad copy-pasting, where the quotation mark \" was accidentally copied along with the large number but not with a matching one. Or if this number was being printed from a computer program, the mark may be a sign that the closing quote around a computer string was accidentally {{w|Escape character|escaped}}, causing it to be interpreted as a literal written quote mark character to be included in the string, rather than a special symbol marking the end of the string.\n|-\n| ,00c2ef46 || Someone messed up real bad and I hope it wasn't me. || Numbers normally only use the digits 0&ndash;9. The presence of the letters c, e, and f suggests that this number is written in {{w|hexadecimal}}, or {{w|Radix|base}} 16, where going up one place represents multiplying by sixteen instead of ten. Instead of ten possible digits for each place, there need to be sixteen: after 9, you count A, B, C, D, E, F, before carrying over to 10. Hexadecimal is mostly used by computers, so Randall, as a programmer, might be worried that the hexadecimal appearing is his fault. Seeing a long string of unexpected characters may indicate a memory bug, such as a ''{{w|buffer overflow}}''. These bugs can lead to crashes, data corruption, and security vulnerabilities, which Randall would rather not be responsible for. In addition, this thought may be a reference to a Douglas Adams quote: \"Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him\" (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).\n\nIf not for the c and f, the letter e could also be read as {{w|E notation}}, a shorthand for {{w|scientific notation}} in many calculators and computer programs. There, \"e\" means \"times ten {{w|to the power of}}\", so &hellip;00e46 (= &hellip;00 &times; 10<sup>46</sup>) would add 46 more zeros to the value of the preceding number. However, usually the number would be {{w|Normalized number|normalized}} to have a single digit before a decimal part, changing any extra digits into a bigger {{w|Power of 10|exponent of ten}}, such as 5.4e84 (= 5.4 &times; 10<sup>84</sup>). The point of normalization is to make it easier to compare the magnitudes of very large and very small numbers, so that the reader doesn't need to count digits in the first place.\n|- \n| (title text) || [desperately] Maybe this is from some country where they use commas as decimal points, and also as digit separators after the decimal, and also use random other characters for decoration??? || In the United States, UK, India, China, Korea, Japan, and other countries, the dot is used to separate the integer part of a number from its fractional part. However, most of mainland Europe and South America uses the comma for this purpose. In some places, one may also see the period used to group digits. Since the final number is unreadable and potentially infinite, this implies that Randall has, naturally, made up an explanation instead of trying to figure out what was really happening.\n|-\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A large number is written along the middle of the panel.
