Or move objects around. Or make any kind of sound. But that covers all the ones that appear in Ghostbusters, so I think we're good.\n}}\n\n==Explanation==\nDisplayed is a {{w|timeline}} chart showing the percentage of people in the {{w|United States}} who have a {{w|camera}} at every moment. [[Randall]] refers to the fact that today most people carry embedded camera devices using their {{w|cell phones}} or the even more modern {{w|Smartphone|smartphones}}.\n\nThe chart shows that after the 1980s the percentage increases rapidly, almost reaching 100% by 2013. The text below the image states that \"We have conclusively settled the questions of {{w|Flying_saucer|flying saucers}}, lake monsters [such as the {{w|Loch Ness Monster}}], {{w|ghost}}s, and {{w|Bigfoot}}\", implying that because almost everyone carries a camera the evidence should have arisen by now to settle any question about such phenomena. Of course, such evidence has ''not'' arisen â€” but that doesn't stop many people from continuing to believe the myths. But at least now it is hard to claim that you saw something, but didn't have a camera to capture it with. If something moved by so fast that you did not have time to take a picture, then it could also be questioned if you have time to see that it was a ghost etc.\n\nThe title text declares that, in the case of ghosts, only the questions regarding phenomena that can be captured with a camera have been settled - leaving, in other words, ghosts that can't be seen, heard, or felt are essentially indistinguishable from an absence of ghosts. The title text also makes a joke about the ghosts of ''{{w|Ghostbusters}}'', a popular film that featured highly visible and noisy ghosts which left a slime. If such ghosts existed, recording them would be very easy.\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A graph with percentage from 0 to 100 on the Y-axis with three ticks with labels, top, middle and bottom. The X-axis is a timeline with years with labeled ticks at every five years interval from 1980 but also including a final tick at the year of release, 2013, which is written in a smaller font. The graph shown a red line that starts before 1980 at just above 0% and stays there through the 80s, rises a little past 1990 and reached 1-2% at around 2000, but then it rises rapidly to 10% at 2005, 75% at 2010, and around 90% at 2013, where the rise begins to flatten out asymptotically towards 100 %.
