He is playing one of the many ''{{w|Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk}}'' titles in which you control a skater and perform tricks to gain points and achievements. While playing the game, he wants to simultaneously perform the trick in real life, both because it is exceptionally difficult to do both and because the game will give him praise when he does a trick successfully.\n\nIn the title text, Randall describes his Bad Idea #271: Dropping into the {{W|half-pipe}} on a {{w|Segway PT|Segway}}. \nOne imagines this would result in the Segway becoming unstable and going completely crazy, hence one would classify it as a \"bad idea.\"\nWhich is surprisingly not the case; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvyHs4VmHs it even looks quite fun].\nThe Segway engineers obviously foresaw this situation and implemented the Segway controller with its tilt sensors accordingly.\n\n17 years later {{w|Tony Hawk}} became a physics professor in [[2967: Matter]].\n\n==Transcript==\n:[A header and an explanation is written above two drawings of Cueball performing skateboard trick while playing games on his PSP.]\n:My Hobby:\n:Doing skateboard tricks in ''Tony Hawk'' while also doing them in real life.\n\n:[Cueball moves towards a quarter pipe on his skateboard while manipulating his PSP.]\n:''Beep''\n:''Click''\n:''Beep''\n\n:[Cueball is in mid air having performed a Frontside 360°, both literally and on the PSP.]\n:''♪ Frontside 360°! ♫''\n:''Frontside 360°!''\n\n{{comic discussion}}\n\n[[Category:Comics featuring Cueball]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring real people]]\n[[Category:Video games]]\n[[Category:Skateboard]]\n[[Category:My Hobby]]"
